So for the person who's using it, the idea is it's going to be or the current idea anyway will be in SCM mode along with a bunch of other things. So that you're in SCM, you've got the QED active and then that's when you can use it and along with lots of the other like the combat stuff is all in SCM. That's the intention at the moment.  So you can still do all the same, everything else, you have the dampener, you have the snare, everything works the same way from that end. And then on the other side, the person who's being pulled out or dampened, the current working plan will be that when you get pulled out, essentially the quantum drive will be disabled or restricted somehow because a lot of the internals of Master Modes doesn't necessarily care about which mode you're actually in directly. It's if your quantum drive is active. That's what quite a lot of the things are. So for example, if you're in Nav mode, but you've turned your quantum drive off for some reason or it's been blown off or damaged or distorted or whatever else,  you will still lose, you won't have access to those top speeds because the quantum drive is off.  So that's what the restriction is.  So if you're in Nav mode and you get quantum dampened or quantum snared, your quantum drive is going to be off and you're going to be limited to SCM speeds for that time period. And then you can swap back to SCM mode yourself and then go try and defend yourself. That's the current plan. We still need to test all these kinds of PU-specific things because there's open questions about things like in a pirate versus cargo hauler situation with QED, for example, what kind of, like, how often should the pirate be successful versus how often should the cargo hauler escape? Because historically we've gone back and forth in balance a lot of the time where the cargo hauler is always able to escape so the pirate can't really do much.

With that in mind, I will try to answer this question in context of the full picture.<br/><br/>The short answer is the state is actually very advanced.<br/><br/>Now the long version. The road to Server Meshing started back in 2017/2018:<br/><br/><b>Object Container Streaming</b><br/>For Server Meshing to work, we first required technology that allowed us to dynamically bind/unbind entities via the streaming system, as this isn't something the engine supported when we started. So when we released 'Client Side Object Container Streaming' (OCS) in 2018, we also released the very first step towards server meshing!<br/><br/>Once this initial stepping stone was out the door, the technology that allows us to dynamically bind/unbind entities on the client had to be enabled on the server as well (as ultimately server nodes in the mesh will need to stream entities in/out dynamically). This technology is called 'Server Side Object Container Streaming' (S-OCS), and the first version of S-OCS was released at the end of 2019. This was the next big step towards Server Meshing.<br/><br/><b>Entity Authority & Authority Transfer</b><br/>While we had the technology that allowed us to dynamically stream entities on the server, there is still only one single server that 'owns' all simulated entities. In a mesh where multiple server nodes share the simulation, we needed the concept of 'entity authority.' This means that any given entity is no longer owned by a single dedicated game server, but instead there are multiple server nodes in the mesh. So, one server node that controls the entity, and multiple other server nodes that have a client view of this entity. This authority also needs the ability to transfer between server nodes. A good amount of development time was dedicated to the concept of 'entity authority' and 'authority transfer' in the first half of 2020. This was the first time the entire company had to work on Server Meshing, as a lot of game-code had to be changed to work with the new entity-authority concept. By the end of 2020 most (game) code was modified to support the concept, so another large step was taken, yet there is no actual mesh in sight.<br/><br/><b>Replication Layer & Persistent Streaming</b><br/>The next step was to move entity replication into a central place where we can control the streaming and network-bind logic. This then allows us to replicate the network state to multiple server nodes. In order to achieve this, we had to move the streaming and replication logic out of the dedicated server into the \"Replication\" layer, which now hosts the network replication and entity-streaming code.<br/><br/>At the same time we also implemented Persistent Streaming, which allows the Replication layer to persist entity state into a graph database that stores the state of every single network replicated entity. 2021 was dedicated to work on the Replication layer and the EntityGraph, which allows us to control entity streaming and replication from a separate process (separated from the traditional dedicated game server). This work is almost complete and is in its final stage.<br/><br/><b>Static & Dynamic Server Meshes</b><br/>However, this still isn't a \"mesh.\" The work on the actual mesh has started and will take us well into next year to complete, and all the pre-requirements that I outlined above were necessary to even get to this point. The first version of this technology will be a static server mesh, and is the next big stepping stone. However, it will also not be the last! With the static mesh, we will have the first version of a true mesh but, as the name 'static' indicates, the ability to scale this mesh is very limited.<br/><br/>Before we can truly call this feature complete, we will need to take on another big step, which we call \"dynamic mesh.\" This step will allow us to dynamically mesh server nodes together and then scale the mesh dynamically based on demand. A lot of the work on this part happens in parallel. For example, the Fleet Manager that controls the dynamic demand of the mesh is already in development, as well as the matchmaking requirements that come with the new inclusion of \"shards.\"<br/><br/>In the meantime, a lot of game-code teams also have to work on adapting existing game code to fully work with a server mesh (and more importantly find all the edge cases that will only surface once we have a true mesh). While the entity authority work was completed in 2020, entity authority is currently only transferred between the client and one single server, so some code may need additional adjustments.", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/18397-Server-Meshing-And-Persistent-Streaming-Q-A", "published_at_timestamp": 1636502400, "title": "Server Meshing and Persistent Streaming Q&A", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "113103d5bfe51e_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The triangular cargo pods of the Railen are actually fixed to the ship and not the cargo containers themselves.

I think when it's going to debut maybe 2.3, if not it will be 2.4, but actually that is all being built in L.A., Paul Randal, Alan Chen, and Mark Abent, are all leading the charge on the Item System 2.0 and it's all part of it. You will be able to not just have accurate messages but they will be contextual and potentially you can have multiple messages so it's not just do one action with an item if there's more than one action that you can do with an item, you will be presented with a list, and those actions can be contextual. For instance a door you can 'open' and you can 'close', but either the door is 'opened' or 'closed', so if the door is 'closed', the contextual action this time would be 'open door' and potentially another contextual action would be 'kick down door', but when the door is 'open', well then your contextual action would probably be 'close door'.That is kind of an example what the new item system is, so it's going to actually allow you to do a lot more then we've done in the past. You will be able to, not just on a general item basis be able to have contextual actions, but they'll be actions tied to sub-parts of an action or ship. You can imagine a radio and a radio has an on/off switch and has a dial on it right? Well the on/off switch and the dial will be two sub-parts and when you're looking, if you're actually looking at the on/off switch, if it's 'off' the action would be to 'turn radio on', the switch would go and the radio would turn on and vice versa. Then if you look at the dial, if the radio is 'on', then your contextual action would be 'tune station' and maybe if 'go right' it would go to station 100.2 and 'go left' would be station 98.So that would all be contextual, so you will be able to do things to items that are 'vehicle', 'vehicles parts', 'parts of vehicles', 'items attached to vehicles', in a way that you haven't been able to do yet which sort of ups the amount of interaction that you can do with the environment and how you can use the world and I think it will actually allow for, again, a lot more cool gameplay.So giving you an example on repairs using items, here's a good example: on a bigger ship you would have these pipes, what we call our pipe system, you have power connecting from the powerplant to turrets because the turrets need new power and weapons would also need power which would generate heat, which would go down another pipe, but let's just focus with just power.We're on a big ship and there's five turrets on the ship and the pipe from the powerplant goes to the different turrets but of course they go through junction boxes. We've been in a battle, we've taken damage, and one side of the ship got damaged, and there was interior damage, and BOOM. This junction box is gone and the fuses are blown on it, so now the power goes to the junction box but can't go from there so now there's no power going out from the junction box to the turret, so the turret on the rear of the ship has gone down. Ok you're like, \"wow, ok we need to get the turret back up or we're dead in the water.\" So one of the crew members can run down to the junction box and right now it's 'closed', so contextual action is 'open junction box' the door opens, you can see inside of it there's a fuse plugged in and it's smoking, blown, and burnt out. You can look at it and say, 'unplug broken fuse' or 'take broken fuse' so he takes it, now it's empty. Now if he went to his inventory, say if he was carrying a new fuse, he could equip the new fuse and then looking junction box, at the empty fuse plug, you can 'plug it in'. Then he plug it in, power comes up, the turret goes back up, close the junction box, bam, the turret on the back is up and running again.That's sort of an example of sort of the things you can do with the new 'Use System' that we're going to do and I think it's going to be super cool and that will run throughout environments and ships and allow you to have a lot more tactile interaction, which is really a big goal with what I want to do with Star Citizen.

By not having a unique identifying color or symbol it could make players think twice before engaging a ship unprovoked.", "answer": "Elwin Bachiller: That's an interesting gameplay question. Right now that has to be playtested to see. I am a really big fan of not really giving you an obvious distinguishing element between the two. Because I do want the world to feel: 1) Extremely cohesive; 2) I want there to be weight behind your decisions.So, if you decide to attack a ship you may not immediately know that its' either an NPC or a PC.Now, the cool thing about not giving you obvious identifiers on a ship is that that then requires you to get a scanner. It adds to the gameplay loop. So, if you get a scanner and scan the ship. Then you might now have the information that you need to make that decision. So, I prefer going that route.Ultimately, it comes down to game design and they'll make the best decision for the game once it's playtested. But my vote is: Don't distinguish.Lance Powell: To add a little extra colour to that as well, I think that the lighting schemes on various style ships will also play a minor part in that. So, when we get down to a lot of the pirate ships, their visible markers at a distance based on the lights and any type of material use will show them as being a potential enemy at a glance.But, to \"Daniel's\" point, that you may not actually get a sense of friend or foe at a glance. Because... you want that interaction. You want that... little more thrill being able to sit back, watch before you engage. And... if you're engaged or if there is some other marker that comes at you that says... oh okay, they're firing on me... it's probably a bad guy. Then it triggers that engagement.The classic style gaming where it's like... you go to your nav point and all of a sudden there's four or five blips of red.

There is a slight wrinkle, and that's that we're using cryengine, so that's not our engine, so typically we'd expect that sort of support to come form cryengine themselves, but seeing as we have a lot of cryengine experts working for us at the moment and we have such a strong standpoint of owning the engine and what we do with it, so we can take some of that support into our hands. We've got some great talent coming in/in at the moment which we'll be telling you about soon, expect to see an inside CIG piece about our new studio in Frankfurt in the near future.

We can kind of see it already with the HUD being actually rendered inside the ships and helmets. What are some challenges you've faced or compromises you've had to make while trying to make the mechanics have diegetic (in-universe) interfaces?", "answer": "Darian Vorlick: So this is where we actually went to one of the developers to kinda get their feedback on this particular question. We went to our UI guru, Zane Bien, and here's what he had to say:In-universe projected interfaces, while extremely immersive, are also affected by a multitude of game and environmental variables, which is many cases might negatively impact accessibility. For instance, if the seat is positioned just a bit too high, too low, too near, or if the field of view is too low, vital information may be lost as a result of being clipped off the edges of the player's screen. If the instrumentation is too small or too distant then readability can become hindered, too big and it can be come overly intrusive on the viewport. These are just a few of the factors we actively take into consideration when modelling the screen and instrumentation layout in the ship cockpits, ensuring that the interface remains accessible to you as pilot, while still allowing the flexibility for compelling diversification and style across ship manufacturers.So again, that information comes from Zane Bien...Travis Day: Damn, he's eloquent.DV: Seriously! But it also brings to light how much detail we try to look at the UI on every perspective, that if we want to make-... Let me rephrase that. The difficulty of creating HUDs for each one of our ships has to take all of these factors into consideration.TD: You know, it's like you're designing an actual ship. It would be so much easier if we just did a screen-space HUD, bloody screen for damage, and call it a day... It would kinda suck, but it would be so much easier!DV: But given that each spaceship has its own unique style of cockpit, you gotta give Zane much props for being able to come up with a unique HUD for each one of these ships while keep the perspective of how close the player is to the screen, how close they are to the HUD, how close they are to the helmet and so forth.TD: Yeah. No I think that Mike Northeast and him spent a tremendous amount of time going back and forth on, what is all the pertinent information? How do we catalog it? Where do we put it in the player's viewspace? What viewspace are they most likely looking at most of the time?DV: And how much real estate each thing takes up... if it's gonna be distracting... what are players most likely to reach for in the cockpit? ...

If they're NPC runned, then obviously the NPCs will obey you, and if they're player run, you're getting instructions from the commander that has a full battle tactical view, and telling you what to do. Hopefully if your organization plays as a team, then you'll listen to those controls and commands.Essentially the idea would be that on some of the bigger ships you would have someone who would run the battle log so to speak and they would be directing the fighter air cover or assigning different ships to attack this other ship over here. What I'm kind of hoping we get down later, this is probably the dogfight v2 or v3, more like v3, we have a couple of big capital ships, and it would be kind of fun to see two groups of players come in with corvettes and launch their fighters and go at each other.There will be a mixed command and control. It's gonna be like a whole other game, a lot of co-op and I think it would be pretty fun. There's a lot of stuff that's going on besides just command and control on the big ships. We're gonna do a more in depth piece about that in the near future. Foundry 42, our studio in the UK that's taken lead on Squadron 42 is gonna take lead on the big ship systems, because they need it for Squadron 42, and they're also gonna do it for the Persistent Universe.There's some really great stuff I've seen going back and forth, 'cause it's not just command and control, there's engineering, there's helm, there's life support, there's a whole bunch of different things, communication, radar, and the idea is a lot of different players, if they work together optimally, can maybe run the ship really efficiently, and well, and have a big edge against someone who isn't doing the same kind of thing. And certainly if the players are doing it, they're gonna have an edge over the NPCs.So we'll make it so the NPCs are good, but they're not as good as an efficiently run player group running a ship. Which is great, 'cause I really want to have this sense of co-operative play in the game, so you fly by yourself, or your fly with your friends to achieve things.I think the co-operative side is as much fun as anything else that you can do. That's generally when I've played other games, even when you're playing against other players, the fun thing is when you are cooperatively working with other people against other players or other NPCs.So that's a big focus for us, and command and control will be kind of like that.Like if you've seen any of these, like the big holotables, like you see in Ender's Game or you saw in Prometheus, it would be that kind of interface, where you're standing by it and you can click and rotate around and see stuff.

It's a very powerful engine, one of, it not the, best looking engines out there for the photo-realistic look and and style that I want.Obviously we have some challenges because we're using the engine for something it wasn't primarily built for. I.e. we're having a big open space with our vehicles flying at fast speeds over long distances.Whereas CryEngine is built for first person, on-foot combat, so generally their play areas are more 4km by 4km, or 8x8km whereas ours will be millions of kilometers across. So we have to do modify the engine to enable that, but most of the things that I want to get done are getting done.There is some longer term stuff I want to do, where I want to go seamlessly from space down to the planet--This is very long term, not the initial release--but we're pretty sure that we'll be able to get that worked into the framework of the engine.My guess is down the road, as we get up and running and continue to add more content, the engine itself will be so heavily modified that it won't really resemble the base engine it came from, because we've got such specific needs for what we're doing.But yeah, it's a great engine, we're really happy, we love the look of it.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 11 (2014.03.10)", "source": "https://youtu.be/ItuiYF_lRGc", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Dreepa", "published_at_timestamp": 1394491510}, {"objectID": "1264199001", "question": "You have also mentioned that you want Star Citizen to replace Crysis as the next benchmark for new GPUs.

One of the nice things about being so strongly funded at the moment is that I can actually take some of the money and invest it in R&D in a way I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to for various areas to make the game better.", "title": "Star Citizen Interview: Chris Roberts On Building A Space Simulator For The Ages", "source": "https://gamingbolt.com/star-citizen-interview-chris-roberts-on-building-a-space-simulator-for-the-ages", "type": "article", "user": "Ravi Sinha", "published_at_timestamp": 1391558400}, {"objectID": "373686080", "question": "Will organizations upon discovering new systems be able to colonize planets, build stations, put up defenses?", "answer": "That's a great question, that's actually something that we, long term, want to do. I'm not so sure whether you'll be able to do the fullest of that on the initial release. Longer term is to do it fully, but shorter term we'll have some mechanics in there that will allow planets themselves or outposts themselves to evolve during the game based on player action and what's happening in the universe. Which I think will be really cool and will fold into my goal of a living breathing universe. We're already looking at organizations, groups of players, being able to buy and build up some industry on various planets. So a certain aspect of that will be there, but to have completely new planets that you'll fully colonize and do all the rest of the stuff, that is definitely a goal, we are definitely working towards that. That is in the feature set we want to promise, but it probably won't be on the initial release just 'cause it's got a lot of stuff to do with it. But again, that's along the lines of some of the procedural R&D that we're doing.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 04 (2014.01.10)", "source": "https://youtu.be/FsWDLHVYNHI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Revan67", "published_at_timestamp": 1389377198}, {"objectID": "1ea69c94611318_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Will there be Mechanics to specially draw a specific Pilot in a Battle Instance we want to fight?
