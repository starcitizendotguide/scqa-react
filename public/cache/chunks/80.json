Xiphopods, known colloquially as \u201cBlind Oni Crabs,\u201d are typically found on worlds with hot grassland environments, but have also been found to be highly adaptable to extreme conditions. They are considered an invasive species in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Their ability to float and propel themselves through the air has made them a favorite subject of xenobiologists.</p><br/><p>Discovered during the initial planetary survey of Leir I, several specimens were captured and delivered to the University of Rhetor for study and classification. The scientists named the new species Xiphopod in honor of its resemblance to animals in the phylum Arthropoda and genus Xiphosura. The surveyors who discovered the animal, inspired by the \u201cface\u201d and \u201cnose\u201d that can be discerned in the animal\u2019s front carapace, were responsible for the more common name \u201cBlind Oni Crab.\u201d</p><br/><h1>Behavior and Ecology</h1><br/><p>Xiphopods are found naturally on Leir I, in hot to warm grassy climates at or near sea level. In their native environments, they spend their time hunting, scavenging for food, and resting. Xiphopods spend part of their year in groups, then split off and travel hundreds of kilometers to join other groups during mating season. Biologists theorize that this behavior developed in order to ensure genetic diversity among the species.</p><br/><p>Their unique flight pattern occurs via biological process. The Xiphopod converts surrounding air into a hydrogen-helium mix and circulates it within a large, hollow cavity. This allows it to float. It then propels itself through the air by expelling gas from its body, which is incredibly light compared to its size. The most heavyweight adult Xiphopod ever found weighed only 300 g (10.58 oz).</p><br/><h1>Invasive Species</h1><br/><p>The Xiphopod is a common invasive species, thanks in large part to its opportunistic omnivorous diet, and its ability to adapt to a variety of conditions. Its reproductive habits also play a part: Xiphopods lay up to a thousand eggs at a time. Typically, the unattended eggs hatch in 13-17 Standard Earth Days. The UEE prohibits the trading of Xiphopods in order to discourage their spread throughout habitable space.</p><br/><p>The hot, dry environment of Hurston (Stanton I) has proven particularly hospitable to Xiphopods. Although it feeds on a variety of food types, it thrives off the biological waste generated from the settlements on Hurston, and has been able to breed in great numbers thanks to the lack of natural predators. While Xiphopod hunting is encouraged by the local government, for the poorest inhabitants of Hurston, the Xiphopod can be a food source. When roasted, the flesh of the Xiphopod becomes white and firm, and the meat has a musty, sweet flavor.", "title": "Galactapedia: Xiphopod (Blind Oni Crab)", "id": "0rqMrr2YP3", "slug": "xiphopod-blind-oni-crab", "template": "PlantAnimal", "type": "galactapedia", "published_at": "2024-10-25", "published_at_timestamp": 1729823822}, {"objectID": "0qal7oJL8k-genesis-i", "answer": "Genesis I is a mesoplanet in the developing Genesis system.

Or how will this be handled?", "answer": "With Static Server Meshing, everything is fixed in advance, including the number of server nodes per shard and which game server is responsible for simulating what locations. This does mean that if everyone in the shard decides to head to the same location, they will all end up being simulated by the same server node.<br/><br/>Actually, the worst case is if all the players decide to spread themselves out between all the locations assigned to a single server node. That way, the poor server will be trying to deal not only with all of the players but it will also need to have streamed in all of its locations. The obvious answer is to allow more servers per shard, so each server node has fewer locations it may need to stream in. However, because this is a static mesh and everything is fixed in advance, having more server nodes per shard also increases running costs. But we need to start somewhere, so the plan for the first version of Static Server Meshing is to start with as few server nodes per shard as we can while still testing that the tech actually works. Clearly that is going to be a problem if we allow shards to have many more players than the 50 we have right now in our single-server \"shards\".<br/><br/>So, don't expect player counts to increase much with the first version. That avoids the issue of a single server node becoming full before players get there since we'll limit the maximum player count per shard based on the worst case. Once we've got this working, we'll look at how the performance and economics work out and see how far we can push it.

At the same time, on some of these planets<br /><br />CR: Just to be clear, I\u201dll also say, so, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to take over control of you unless you deviate from the, but it\u2019s like landing here in Los Angeles, or landing in London, there\u2019ll be a flight path that you\u2019re given that you need to stick to. If you deviate from it, then you know, they, your autopilot of your ship will sort of be taken over and they\u2019ll land it, but you know, for instance there certainly will be a level on ArcCorp that you\u2019re above, you know that you can fly over Los Angeles at 30,000 feet and that\u2019s okay, it\u2019s just going, coming down close\u2026<br /><br />TZ: Yes of course, it only applies to you coming in close proximity<br /><br />CR: and it only applies to the sort of the big landing zones, the cities that people \u2026 crash into<br /><br />TZ: The problem we\u2019re trying to solve is we don\u2019t want people setting their ships down in the courtyard of Area 18.

So we have a multicrew ship, we have to sync to a lot more clients now, so we have to see what will limit, what can the guys in the ship received from all the other. Do we sync everything, do we sync less for them because maybe it\u2019s not important that we sync every little thing that\u2019s happening in the ship to ship combat, for them it\u2019s more important that they manage the shields correctly and they see the situation on the ship, or they deal with the boarding party,so that's more important for the guys on the ship, so maybe that will take priority, it\u2019s\u2026 again.

How do you draw the line between maintaining an overview and going too far down the detail rabbit hole? Give us an example.", "answer": "Darian Vorlick: I think this is a question we've both been looking for, at least we've waiting for this question to be able to answer it.Eric Kieron Davis: It's very tough. We're going to get to later, I think there's a question on ownership but when we talk about what our backgrounds are, what we're experienced in and what we know we'll tend to spend a little bit more time in those. So you hire different production with different skillsets to provide you different perspectives. So if you have a producer that's very technical they may know a little bit more about the detail so they may answer those questions better. As you said in that post, \"know enough to be dangerous\", right?DV: Yes. I actually got that from Senior Producer Jason Hutchins.EKD: It's great, it's exactly right. So I think the question's \"how do you draw the line?\" You just got to figure out what you need to dig into. For me, it's good to have an overview of the schedule; to plan it; to work with your leads and your team; but then sometimes you have to get into the weeds, you have to dig in even further. So it's not necessarily you shouldn't do one or the other: it's more you do each at different times.DV: That and when I first started here, I'm not a coder, I'm not a programmer, I'm not an engineer, so there was a little bit of a feeling of displacement when I first started because I wasn't really sure if I would be able to talk at the level that's necessary for the engineers and designers. But just through sheer saturation I feel I can at least carry on a semi-decent, intelligent conversation that doesn't rely on just grunts and pointing.DV: So being able to have a conversation about the Item system or the Entity Token system with developers, like on a phone call this morning, I think we should know enough just to be able to ask questions on how progress is going and know when someone is bluffing us. So we have to be able to read, what's the word I'm looking for, anticipate what the needs of that particular discipline are. We don't need to be experts in it, we just need to know enough to be able to converse with the developers and be able to manage those tasks.EKD: Sure. So give us an example. I think you already started talking about one: the Entity Token. Right?DV: Yes!EKD: So how did you manage that how did you draw the line between; how far did you go versus \"I just need to stay back and help you guys get it done\"?DV: For reference, this is what we were talking about on a Skype call we had this morning with our UK office, with one of our programmers Stephen Humphreys, and he's in charge of our Entity Token which is the sequel to GOST. So I am not fluent in FlowGraph in CryEngine but with the way the Entity Token system's working I know enough about what they are trying to accomplish with it to at least know what the end goal is; what they are trying to do to get there; what the voids are; and if a certain person leaves an aspect of this project what more resources do we need to allocate to that.DV: And knowing who has what skillset is absolutely necessary knowledge to have in order to be able to fulfill that void. So in talking to Mr Humphreys we knew that he was making progress on certain aspects, certain concepts; I need to be able to ask how far is he; where's he going with it; and i had to be able to converse with him at a level where it showed I understood what he was trying to do.EKD: I would say lastly I was just re-reading this about \"how you maintain that overview?\" That's kind of the point of production: we are the third party perspective; we are the outsider; we aren't in the weeds per se so we are able to get a large overview. So I think, intrinsically, by being Production and being required to not know everything down to its base level that allows us to keep that overview. Right? So then we chose, as producers, where we should learn more information to help understand that better.DV: That becomes a double edged sword because the more technical detail you have, where does it stop where the producer starts getting more involved with the actual technical, for example, if the producer can read code or write code it doesn't mean that he's going to start jumping in and changing people's code when he sees a mistake or he feels something should be changed. That should be up to the designers and the programmers, and the producer should just be there to guide them towards the specific objective and not interfere with what the designer and programmer is doing.EKD: Absolutely, great question.", "published_at": "2015-10-26", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 12", "source": "https://youtu.be/jx2NSZOGNqE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Graxas", "published_at_timestamp": 1445896605}, {"objectID": "373681000", "question": "Fresh content is critical to engage players in the PU and you have hinted at the possibility of having players generate content. What sort of content would be considered?", "answer": "Well, I've talked about this quite a few times. We did the next great starship to sort of develop a few ships that were user-generated. I mean, we've got the Redeemer already, and we actually would like to bring a few of the other ships from NGS into the game when we have time. We've got such a huge backlog of ships that it takes some time to get everything in. But it does help that we have quite a few people that work on the drake Brutus and the Redeemer in house, so they can help finish off their stuff properly in the game. But long-term, yeah, we'd like to try and have user-generated content. I think I've mentioned that we were thinking about we could potentially sort of have the equivalent of a spec that was put out by the UEE saying we need a new kind of this ship, and these are the specs of it,and then solicit designs and models from people and as it comes past a certain amount, then if it passed the quality bar, it could potentially be deployed into the game and sold online and perhaps there'd be some kind of revenue split that would go between the creator and the game itself, just like you have, Valve does this pretty well. So that would be maybe a path, maybe the same for clothing on characters, and we're also toying around with doing some kind of mission editor stuff. That's kind of longer term, but again, those would all be tools that would be very useful for all the modding stuff that we need to do anyway, and maybe deploy some of that early to allow some people into sort of say our test bed, to come up with like, some encounters or something and then submit them in and we'd pick the best encounter and roll that out to everyone else with one of the patches, or stuff like that. I think all that sort of stuff is stuff we're looking at because it's hard, even with the amount of people we have, to generate enough content to keep up with the whole of your guys consumption, and having more people in the community contribute to that, and there's a whole bunch of people in the community who're super talented, that would be great. So, we're definitely thinking about that, it's definitely part of our plans, and it's really just sort of fitting it in with all the other myriad things we've got to do.

It's very cool and it has a whole bunch of layering which includes the same sort of wear and tear systems that we have for the ships and the buildings so we will definitely have wear and tear on the clothes. So, over time they will become a bit older and then you will either have to buy some new ones. I don't know if you'll necessarily have to take them to a tailor and fix them up kinda thing, the ships will definitely have that, not sure about clothes. On the damage side of it, we haven't finalized how we're exactly handling the external damage. Long term we want to have something that is not too dissimilar to what we're doing for ships, for character damage for where you get shot on your arm and stuff like that. If we get that working, it would persist the same way we do for ships. For right now, you definitely have wear and tear on clothes longer term when the new shader's in.

I actually don't know the specific implementation for that, I just know that the idea with it was to search your hard drive and pull out your music and then play it. Potentially, you would have to make sure you all have the same music and then also, I'm not sure if that aspect is being serialized over the network. As in, it may just be a local thing that you play locally and when someone else has entered your hangar they may not know what music is playing in it. I am actually going to check on that one because that's one of those details that probably no one thought of but you do need to sync that over the network if it's going to work properly.

There isn't really code that does this, it wouldn't be that difficult to do, but I don't know if it's all that worthwhile. But yes, you could definitely get in really close to a ship and kind of hide in it's radar shadow, and EVA out and around it if you wanted to.", "published_at": "2014-12-01", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 47 (2014.12.01)", "source": "https://youtu.be/E8Euwh_fPeg", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Kaochat", "published_at_timestamp": 1417474885}, {"objectID": "373678220", "question": "If I hire a few NPCs to crew my Retaliator, will they have a day-night cycle on the ship? Will I need to do a crew rotation, so that after an hour or two of real-time, I'll need to assign members to the \"off-duty\" crew station so that they can recharge up to 100% effectiveness through resting, eating and sleeping?", "answer": "I would say so, we're planning on having a day/night cycle for SQ42, so you'll be on a big capital ship, so I don't see why we wouldn't extend that system to the PU. So on some level you'll have to manage your crew in that way, but that'd only really affect really long journeys because most of the time it's not necessarily be quite as long, and you'd be near the planet before everybody needed to sleep. But I guess for those longer trips, it's one of the reasons we have beds on the ships, besides the ability to save your game while you're out in space.

We kinda think there'll be two different kinds of missions, those that are persistent and those that are instances. Persistent missions would be like if there was a pirate lord, and he only exists in one place at any time, and only one player or group of players would get to kill him, he wouldn't be killed in say 10 different instances. But there will definitely be missions that will be specific to you as a player, so you know, an idea would be you've got to fix a navigation satellite, perhaps that's a mission given to 20 different players, and the particular area where that satellite exists is an instance just for you, and each of the other players would also have individual instances for that satellite repair, there might be NPCs there, but it's player focussed.", "published_at": "2014-10-06", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 40 (2014.10.06)", "source": "https://youtu.be/pBWJYb2Wtg0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "The Tick", "published_at_timestamp": 1412632803}, {"objectID": "373679030", "question": "How are jump point sizes going to be handled? Will it be more or less random for undiscovered systems? Do jump points widen from continuous use over time as trade lanes become established?", "answer": "I don't think we're going to have the jump point itself dynamically change, but we will definitely have jump points of different sizes - so one jump point is big enough to take capital ships as well as smaller ships, another jump point is only big enough for a small light ship. So think of it almost like a \"mountain pass\" on what you can fit through it. And so that will kinda make some interesting dynamics because maybe the bigger ship would have to jump around 2 or 3 hops, but the smaller ship can go there in 1 hop because this jump point is pretty unstable and can only take a small ship from the outside. So we're gonna use a little bit of that for some of the interest of the balancing, and obviously the jump points that allow the bigger ships to go through are probably the ones that become more common for trading lanes, so things like Starfarers and stuff and go through them.I think that'll make a kind of interesting dynamic in trading lanes and what happens out in space, but that's still early stages of the development of the Persistent Universe.", "published_at": "2014-08-25", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 35 (2014.08.25)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Uyur8rqbEHc", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Darkarma", "published_at_timestamp": 1409004035}, {"objectID": "373684700", "question": "How will the economy in the Persistent Universe handle inflation?Players always want to feel like they're getting ahead for their time spent, and never want to lose something they've \"earned.\" Money sinks like rent, repair costs, taxes, and mandatory consumables have been loudly denounced by players in other MMO games, but without countermeasures, inflation is inevitable and eventually game destroying.How will Star Citizen get the players to swallow the bitter pill for better long-term health?", "answer": "We're setting up Star Citizen much like the real world.We actually do have, whether you want to call it money sinks, I call it running costs, of things like repairing your ship, keeping up to date, we have taxes in the form of landing fees or trade tariffs depending on where you are.So if you're in a very state-regulated area, there's a lot of law enforcement, well then yeah, it costs a bit more to do business there, because you're paying for the protection essentially.There is an equivalent of consumables because we have fuel. You can go harvest your own fuel, or you may not have time, so you may just pay to refuel when you're down on a planet. But in general will cost you to operate, as well as things you may earn.So our hope is that we're not going to have wild inflation, because we have consumption as well as production. And whether that consumption and production are properly balanced, well that's part of the challenge of the economy system that we're building.We're sort of building a whole, stand alone, simulator that would interface to our persistent universe server, and we can have a meta view of the galaxy and that's actually not that far from us playing with it internally, so at that point, I could tell you. But essentially, we are trying to, in a rough way, simulate what happens in the real world.In the more unregulated areas, there aren't so many dues, or taxes, or duties, and so you can have a better margin when you're selling. The risk is that you may get attacked and you won't get the same level of protection that you would in the inner systems.", "published_at": "2014-04-21", "title": "10 for the Chairman Episode 17 .

So everyone can put money in and the organization can buy some ships or the organization can buy some real estate. Ultimately an organization could potentially be controlling an economic node.An economic node is when we talk about a factory producing weapons or a mining operation mining materials.So one of the goals of the organization system is to allow groups of people to work together and maybe achieve objectives that a single person won't be able to do by themselves.

So really the risk in jump points is for the uncharted jump points where you don't have a nav path already set.
