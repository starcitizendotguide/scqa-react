Its frame is easily modified, and has undergone numerous technology retrofits in the past three centuries. Beginning in the 2930s, squadrons began to phase out the Gladius and convert to newer craft like the F8 Lightning, the F7A Hornet, and the Anvil Arrow, and surplus Gladius became available on the civilian market. In 2951, Aegis increased the budget on Gladius production and invested in upgrade packages and next-generation variants of the design. </p><br/><h1>DEVELOPMENT</h1><br/><p>The Gladius' development began in 2573 as a replacement for the obsolete Elio-Harman Stiletto interceptor, which suffered from an inability to adapt to more modern shield components and faced increased supply chain issues following Elio-Harman Aerospace's bankruptcy. The Gladius was created for service aboard smaller capital ships that weren't outfitted for full-scale aerospace operations. It was also the first ship to introduce a civilian-style modularity into fighter design; this allowed the Gladius to be quickly upgraded or outfitted for other missions without requiring a longer stay in the hangar for a refit. </p><br/><p>The Gladius saw widespread adoption upon its rollout in 2579. Its base model has been continually upgraded over the years, to the point that a present day Gladius Mark VI pilot would have a difficult time flying a Mark I or Mark II model. </p><br/><h1>SERVICE HISTORY</h1><br/><p>The Gladius has seen service in almost every type of operation and engagement involving the Human military for the past three centuries and recorded thousands of kills against pirates, armed rebels, raiders, and unidentified aggressors. Anti-piracy operations, reconnaissance, search and rescue missions, jump scouting (with extended duration packs installed) and countless other roles have been fulfilled by the Gladius. </p><br/><p>The Gladius has proven effective against the Vanduul Blade, to which it is considered a rough 1:1 match. The design suffers against the latest Blade spacecraft encountered on the frontier, although exceptional Gladius pilots have made headway in developing techniques for countering the superior alien starfighters. A safer \"weave style\" maneuver has also been adapted for countering superior Vanduul forces. </p><br/><h1>CURRENT STATUS</h1><br/><p>The rollout of the F8 Lightning has changed the dynamic for the UEE fighter force, freeing up additional battle-tested Hornets to be handed down. The Navy has begun swapping second tier Gladius units over to Hornets as more elite squadrons go from the Hornet to the Lightning. This has not impacted every duty station as the Hornet is not a 1:1 replacement for the lighter Gladius. Nevertheless, the decommissioning process has created a major surplus of Gladius hulls and parts which have been made available to civilians with their weapons technologies and other classified components removed.</p><br/><p>Gladius and their parts are still produced by Aegis, though not in the numbers seen at the height of the Messer Era (2546 - 2792).

So yeah, we do have lots of non-combat, so things like, obviously, a medic. And again, we kind of, not just by class, because obviously like Luke mentioned, it's not just always about the mass and the size or more protection. It's also about like, what makes sense? You know, if you're a first responder, what would you wear? You probably wear something light, quick on your feet, can get down to it if, you know, someone's in a cave or whatever, get down there and help someone out. But then obviously we talked about potentially the ideas of like a medic on the front line, so they'd have a bit more protection. But the things with the medic, obviously they've got the visor, so they're gonna have more, when they ping and scan, they're gonna have the vital signs of people in their group. So if someone's down, they're gonna get a notification on their screen, be like, someone's over there and that may be how long they've got before they're incapacitated. And then obviously we've also looked at the idea of like refilling your med pen, so the vials on your leg, again, kind of being a systemic system about it. Rather than discarding your med pen, you actually put them back and they slowly refill. So it means that your primary role isn't just focused on combat, you're on the front line, like healing people up and helping them, body dragging them to areas of safety and whatnot. But then we've got a lot, we've just started concepting like the tech suit, which I know is quite a vague term, but obviously we've got hacking in the game coming soon and that would be like the idea that you can remote hack, so maybe you don't actually have to go up to the terminal and this suit will excel at that. And obviously, again, you'll have your own different visor. And one exciting feature is like wireless charging, which I know we're quite passionate about. So some of our combat armors, which we've not really spoke about before, but if you have your energy magazines and you store them onto your suit, you'll start to get a bit of trickle charge because they are essentially batteries. So these magazines will start to slowly recharge and there's kind of like the trade off, right? So it's like ballistic, they've got limited capacity, but maybe they do more damage, whereas like energy ammo, you can slowly recharge it over time via your suit is powering it, but maybe they do do as much damage or maybe they don't have as much travel distance. And one of the beauties with the tech suit is the idea that you can wirelessly charge your teammates around you. So if I was wearing the suit, Luke and Zach would have their energy mags start to slowly recharge. But yeah, like obviously we mentioned like the pilot suits and we talked about racing[, the environment suit, the leader.] [...] So we've got environment suits. So obviously like, you know, we're going to have these planets that we're introducing and all these different systems are going to have lots of hot and cold temperatures, radiation, corrosive. And these planets are going to be, you know, you're not going to be able to travel to these in just any old army. You're going to have to prepare. You're going to think about storage. And it's like, if you're like an artifact hunter or you want to, you grab resources or you want to be the Luke guy and you want to collect everything, like in a Fallout game or whatever, then you're going to have to wear one of these suits and go from there.<br/><br/>L: The other thing is like, we'll be scaling back which suits have EVA capabilities as well. So there are some very specialised EVA suits in the game. So if you want to spend a lot of time out in space, these are the ones you'll wind around.<br/><br/>N: Yeah, exactly. And if you're like a salvager, for example, and you're going out in space, like you're going to need a lot of, like oxygen capacity and EVA capacity, these are going to be a much bigger deal than they are now. Like it's going to be a lot of kind of preparing for like, okay, like you said, if you're, you know, mid-battle, maybe I want to sneak out, do some salvaging, get back quick.", "title": "Star Citizen Live: Q&A Characters and Creatures", "source": "https://youtu.be/sOa_TrIXQaE", "type": "youtube", "published_at_timestamp": 1731067920}, {"objectID": "1b9acccac03b1b_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Yes, it has externally accessible personal storage and a weapon rack.", "published_at_timestamp": 1716242400, "question": "Does the Firebird have any on-board personal storage in lieu of cargo capacity?", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/19976-Q-A-Aegis-Sabre-Firebird", "title": "Q&A: Aegis Sabre Firebird", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "b5efcf22a0cbe_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "It does not have any additional self-defense equipment, nor is currently planned to have any in the future.", "published_at_timestamp": 1659045600, "question": "In addition to the main anti-aircraft turret, does the Centurion have any other self-defense equipment, like decoys or noise launchers?

The packet rate sent by a server is determined by its frame rate, and how many entities are updating and have new data to send to the clients. Neither the frame rate of a client or the rate at which it sends packets to its server have any influence on this.<br/><br/>2) AI logic is run entirely on the servers and the higher a server's frame rate the faster the AI \"think,\" leading to quicker reaction times. Their ability to plan ahead isn't really affected by frame rate though so faster frames won't make them smarter. Some recent bugs with the AI have been due to desync issues, where what you see on the client no longer reflects what they are doing on the server. Good old fashioned bug fixing and continuing to flesh out the AI systems are where the improvements will come from.<br/><br/>3) Yes it would be possible but this is not something we're currently considering. Running a server at a higher frame rate means it can't update as many players and other entities. Since servers cost money to run we want them to simulate as many entities and players as possible. The final version of server meshing should allow us to balance the load between multiple servers so that we can maintain a consistent frame rate on all of them.

Are there plans to revamp that throughout the rest of the year?", "answer": "Yeah, yeah, I mean, I think the newsletter's going to come out today that will basically say that. So what the website that we just launched is just Stage 1, and really that was sort of focusing on separating out Star Citizen and Squadron and then the community, which is basically the RSI side and the store, because the old website, if you went to it, and you're like, okay, I've heard about Star Citizen, it's like this information overload, how do I get the game, where do I go, what's the game about, it's not very obvious for the site, so the site that we've rolled out, we feel like does a better job of that. I mean, I did notice people commenting, going, oh, it just seems the same, but that's mostly because the site's also smart, so if you've already got an account or you're already logged in, it's taking you to the default places that you normally go, like the community section, which of course haven't changed much, right? They've become a little less cluttered because we moved some of the elements of the Star Citizen and Squadron stuff to be moved to its own parts, but it hasn't changed, or the store hasn't really changed either, and those are things, so we wanted to get those sort of, like, hey, the Star Citizen thing seems cool, or I want to get into it, so we sort of focused on that, the beginning, not so much the later store experience of, oh, well, now I want to upgrade my ship, or it's more just like, hey, I've heard about Star Citizen, can I give you $40 to become a part of it? And so that was what the focus was for the current site and also making Squadron and Star Citizen so it wasn't so confusing that you understood, okay, this is a single-player game, this is the massively multiplayer online game, and explaining it and having some tutorials because previously most of the stuff was fans, I mean, basically our fans do a great job of educating and showing and all the streamers do the same thing, which is awesome, so don't stop doing that. But we felt like we should do it better, so it's the first step, but we are absolutely going to be working on the subscriber side, the concierge side had a bit of a revamp, which is kind of cool, the subscriber side, the store needs a lot of work, and then just sort of the community development section again, yeah, we're going to work on that.

It\u2019s got 440 blend shapes, the mesh itself I think with all the blendshapes is about 300 megabytes without LOD\u2019s.<br /><br />JH: Really, really expensive before.<br /><br />CR: Yeah and so you could have maybe one of two heads on the screen and we had like 44 different areas of blended wrinkles and blended diffuse and the texture was really high, so we used to have 96 megabytes of blend textures which is quite a lot, and then we had the diffuse normal spec, transmittance, and the scattering mask which were all these extra layers that we baked the stuff in.<br /><br />So we had about 150 megabytes of texture memory per head at the resolution we\u2019re doing at for these characters, that\u2019s all. That was a big focus of the graphics crew and how to bring that down. So we brought both the mesh data down and also the texture data down. So we basically reduced the 300 megabyte mesh stuff down to about 30 megabytes. So that was more about the base mesh and how we were going to delta it and some clever compression stuff they\u2019re working on.<br /><br />We also took the cost of all the textures down, you know from some I think for, we did a special thing for the wrinkle and the blend maps and stuff where we went from 72 megabytes just for those down to six. So essentially we\u2019ve done a 10x saving which makes it much more viable to have a lot of these heads and that detail in the game which is good and then the last sort of segment that worked on was of course, when you have 440 blend shapes and I think there\u2019s something like 175 joints or whatever, I don\u2019t think I put this on my cliff notes, but that\u2019s a lot of control.<br /><br />So we have the blend shapes, we have the joints and I believe there\u2019s also some other controllers for the wrinkle maps and the diffuse map, so in all ended up with very close to 1000 controllers to animate a face so that\u2019s kind of the equivalent of animation a 1000 joints and if you have 10 characters, that\u2019s 10,000. If anyone knows about game animation that\u2019s a lot of joints to do.<br /><br />JH: A lot<br /><br />CR: So one of things that\u2019s quite nice is we\u2019ve been working with Three Lateral and they have a rig logic that has a lot fewer inputs that\u2019s sort of more about the facial poses of position and that gets translated into where to move what blendshape to fire or where the joint is, or what normal map or diffuse maps, wrinkle maps firing, and that\u2019s what we call the runtime rig technology and it\u2019s also very critical because we use that, that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to be able to have all these different heads and faces and be able to blend them and stuff. It doesn\u2019t matter, we can play the same dialogue on whatever head, doesn\u2019t matter. It can be Mark Hamill, Gary Oldman, it could be a custom character one because it goes through this rig logic that takes the inputs and puts it out to the appropriate blend shape, joint and everything like that.<br /><br />That also has the advantage of\u2026 it has about 183 inputs versus about 1000 controllers, so it\u2019s a lot less data that\u2019s going to go  through in our animation data for the facial which is\u2026<br /><br />JH: Another big savings too.<br /><br />CR: So those are all the things that we\u2019re trying to keep the planned resources down and we you know, have a few other plans, but I think we\u2019re going to be able to live a high quality that you would normally see in pre-rendered cinematics, but you would actually see it in the game, live, in real time.", "title": "Star Citizen: 10 for the Chairman - Special Edition", "source": "https://youtu.be/I2SBYtj9pis", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Kyran", "time": "22m31s", "published_at_timestamp": 1474502281}, {"objectID": "373673330", "question": "What process do you have in place to get a sound into the game?", "answer": "Everyone has their ownership of a process with, of course, a final say, but it\u2019s not cut and dry with what makes it and what doesn\u2019t, there\u2019s no official \u201cSign off\u201d because sound is constantly reiterated and refined.", "title": "Star Citizen: August Subscriber's Town Hall feat.

Also: Space whales?!", "answer": "Forrest Stephan: Excellent question.Sean Tracy: Space whales, I love it.FS: I don't know about space whales, but I do know working with oceans in the patch, it's shader driven?ST: Yup.FS: So I think that it is achievable without killing performance.ST: Absolutely and again, Carsten Wenzel is one of the... He's unsung, he's very quiet unless he's very angry, but he's written white papers for the engine, he's been there from the get go and he's actually working within this. He's actually training one of our junior programmers to do this particular implementation. So him and a gentleman by the name of Tiago who went ID software I believe and worked on Doom, worked on our oceans originally within the CryEngine. I think I can go out on a limb and say the oceans within the CryEngine were one of the best features within the engine.FS: They're amazing, it's incredible.ST: We had scattering through the waves, all this crazy stuff that eventually...FS: When you go underwater, the volumetrics, it's just gorgeous.ST: Exactly. So I think you can expect at least that level of fidelity, but what's tricky again about water is how, first of all the highlight changes at a distance. So when you're approaching a planet, the planet has got to react very differently, specularity wise to the surface first of all.FS: Well the furnell is just..ST: Exactly. Then when you get up close, you want to see waves, but you don't want to see it tiling everywhere, so we've got this real big scale problem that we're going to have to deal with, dynamic tessellation on this stuff, being able to have displaced waves and things like this and then additionally if we want to go underwater, which a ship to design should be able to do, right? Lets hope the design says ships are submarines also. To me, if a ship can go into outer space, it can go underwater right? I think it should be able to go underwater, but whatever, we'll see how that goes with the design in terms of that design thing. I think that's should happen.ST: If you go underwater, space whales indeed.FS: I'm going to have a task when I get back to my desk to make sure the jet pack supports underwater as well.ST: Oh! That's a good point, right. What a Pandora's box right, cause you get under, you open the back of the Cutlass and what happens, right. Shouldn't the water flow in, right, but with the local physics grid like pushing water out, I don't know. There's all sorts of crazy...Thomas Hennessy: A submarine though is built to withstand the extreme weight and pressure that the water puts on it and I don't think a ship needs to withstand the same amount of pressure in outer space.ST: Yeah, I'm not sure, wouldn't you think a missile hitting the side of your has a lot of pressure?TH: I feel like a missile hitting the side of your ship is close enough.ST: Right, I don't know, anyways.TH: I don't know, I'm just saying. When J.J Abrams did it to the enterprise, I think it was kind of dumb.ST: What? Put it underwater?TH: Yeah.ST: Oh I think it was fine, it's got shields, shields!FS: Are you talking about Voyager home?TH: No the one where.FS: Isn't Voyager home, it's underwater?TH: No.FS: No?TH: No.ST: Oh that shot, that shot when he's coming out of the water.TH: The new Star Trek with that J.J Abrams did where the Enterprise is hiding underwater.ST: And then it comes out of it.TH: Yeah it was cool, but it didn't make any sense.ST: [Laughs] But it didn't make any sense, fair enough.TH: Anyways, sorry.FS: Can ships go underwater if the Enterprise can do it.ST: Who knows.FS: No. [Laughs]ST: Yeah right and again this will be a design debate and as you see there's a couple different mindsets. I'm sure all the players are gonna go \"Ya, Absolutely they need to go underwater\" because that will be more fun.FS: Then other people will be like \"No! Finish the game!\".ST: Nah we can do a hunt for Red October things.FS: I'm more interesting in the space whales personally.ST: And the Space Whales.FS: [Whale noises]ST: We talked a little bit earlier in a question about Fauna anyways so space whales, megafauna, I think we're gonna have to support something like this. Whether it's whales or big big things on the ground, walking around.. Yeah sure, space whales, let's do it. You heard it here.TH: [claps in the background]ST: So that pretty much pushes Chris into a corner right?FS: Do you want to hear my space whale joke?ST: Oh yeah, I do.FS: So a space whale walks into a bar and he sits down next to another space whale and the space whale goes [Whale noises] [Whale noise intensifies] and then the space whale looks over and goes...

It seems nearly impossible to make a whole planet explorable to us. Will there be like Landing Zones where we'd be directed to and from there we can explore a part of that planet?", "answer": "So yes, the answer is that is our plan.  The first stage is planets that you can land on will have one landing zone or multiple landing zones, and then you would go and land in them and most of the time you would deal with traffic control where you will request permission to land and then fly down to the planet where you can still move around your spaceship and look around, but you'll be on an autopilot mode when you fly down.  That's to stop players from moving off the beaten path or crashing into the city, and doing other sorts of things that could be disruptive (laughs).  As we move forward and work on new tech, which I've been hinting at, but we're not ready to share or really talk about, we'll probably open up some areas on the planet where we would have besides, say a populated environment like we're releasing with the social module, say Area 18 in Arc Corp, we would have some other areas you could explore.  Nice, pretty landscapes where perhaps there are some minerals to be found or mined, or some ruins to be explored.  So, we'd start to open up some stuff that way which would encompass some of the procedural stuff that we've been doing research on, and was one of the stretch goals that we had a while back.  Long term, my dream is to have as much of a planet as we can, the caveat is that we do everything with such a high level of fidelity and detail that we can't have that more simplistic feel that you see in No Man's Sky, which is super cool, but if you have cities like we have with that detail, you'd expect there'd be more than one of them on a planet, and there'd be traffic moving between them.  It would feel inhabited, and to build out worlds with that level of fidelity is a level above, but that will definitely be long term, after the base game is out and we're adding features, that would certainly be something we'd be questing after to try and deliver because I believe it would increase the believability of the universe we're trying to build.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 63", "source": "https://youtu.be/Xgc0lyWFEuw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "FireFly85", "published_at_timestamp": 1440453543}, {"objectID": "373682240", "question": "When looking at the QA team work load, roughly what is the split in testing between: Running through pre-defined scripts/regression testing.

So, depending on the size of your load-out and the size of your armour, it encumbers you. If you are in your light armour with a limited load-out, as you run along you will end up being able to sprint further, have better stamina. That also means that when you come to a stop and you aim down sights, you are less out of breath so you'll have less bob and you'll be a little bit more stable. As you move up to medium and heavy, as you would imagine, as you become more encumbered it's easier for you to become out of breath. You can see it on your visor as it steams up and you'll see it too, as you come to a rest it will take you longer to settle if you're more out of breath. So, those are the broad strokes of the way the stamina system works and how it's affected by your load-out as well as the armour that you choose. There's lot of little nuance things that happen in there, like how you react to recoil, how your gun moves, that you will get to see and appreciate once you play the module.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 06 (2015.05.04)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Jmsn9aURZ4Q", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Steve Hunter", "published_at_timestamp": 1430776682}, {"objectID": "373677840", "question": "What kind of mechanics do you have in mind for science and how do you see science being profitable/interesting? Also how big of an impact can we expect our science to have on the verse at large?", "answer": "That's a fairly big question to answer, I don't necessarily see science as an individual thing. We've talked about have a science specific ship, but that'll be more about exploration, scanning things, whether it be finding an alien artifact, or figuring out how to break down some Xi'an technology to use on your ship. There's not going to be a specific role that you'd say \"Oh, I'm a scientist and I sit back and do research, and after 4 years I'll come up with a new way of doing jump travel\" for example, because that's too much of a nebulus game path , 'cause you really need to be doing stuff all the time. At least right now we don't have a science role planned where a player could do experiments every day then eventually perhaps find a new piece of tech. I think longer term we'll have new technology into the world in a fun way, so maybe we'll get players involved and say, if there's an alien artefact, a player might get a reward for finding it, they might take it to the UEE science base, and then a couple of weeks later they come out with better fusion engine tech based on that find or whatever. So there'll be ways that players can be involved, but we haven't really figured that out. Longer term there might be a science play-path for that, but for now science is more of an abstract concept. There might be actions and play-styles that could pertain to that, but it's not really a career path that anyone can take as their sole role.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 46 (2014.11.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/FXnNwUmnl3o", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Migo", "published_at_timestamp": 1416870046}, {"objectID": "373678650", "question": "In the Wing commander film we saw the Tigers Claw hangar bay had an atmospheric shield allowing the crew to work in the normal conditions while fighters come and go through the field.

On the bigger ships like the Bengal Carrier there will be a type of force field so the flight crew can be on the flight deck and go about their jobs. That's one of the tasks in our graphics department at the moment, having a shield that a player or ship can go through which kinda \"breaks it apart\" around the ship and connects again afterwards.

How do you tackle such a situation wherein you are actually \u2018over\u2019 funded?", "answer": "To be honest, to be funded at this level is really relieving and reduces pressure for me. When I first started out, this was always going to be an ambitious game so I didn\u2019t actually think I would ever be able to raise the money to build the game I wanted to build. Just from the crowd, it was like\u2026okay, the crowd wanted a space sim. We started to do so well that I thought maybe we could raise the 20 million that I think we needed to build this game, but we did that and more this year. So now it gets to the point where the extra money isn\u2019t like, \u201cokay, great I can buy a new holiday\u201d but about building a bigger and better universe. And then doing things like investing in sort of longer-term graphical performance research and we\u2019re also investing in some procedural stuff. I can afford to have a team that is just doing some procedural work in research.<br/><br/>It may or may never ever pay off in the game but if it does, it would be really great. So it\u2019s allowing me to do that and sort of allowing me to scale resources sooner than I would have done\u2026if I didn\u2019t have as much money I would\u2019ve been a  little bit slower about it, because you actually want to be more cautious so you don\u2019t over-spend. But now I can sort of scale up teams to be working on every feature in the game right now. That just means for the game itself, the full-featured game, is going to have a better chance of being delivered when \u2013 and one hopes it\u2019s going to get delivered \u2013 and it\u2019s certainly going to be in a better state.", "title": "Star Citizen Interview: Chris Roberts On Building A Space Simulator For The Ages", "source": "https://gamingbolt.com/star-citizen-interview-chris-roberts-on-building-a-space-simulator-for-the-ages", "type": "article", "user": "Ravi Sinha", "published_at_timestamp": 1391558400}, {"objectID": "373685940", "question": "With the new Youtube copyright issue with companies redacting videos or claiming them as their own, will you allow videos of Star Citizens?", "answer": "So the simple answer is yes.
