With every patch, they're changing the format of the data, and pretty dramatically so at times, so it'd be foolish to end the wipes so early on despite this reality. Instead, their goal is to get to a place where the game features are more stable and less tumultuous before they \"flip the switch\". On top of this, they need a strategy about what they do when they change the formats of data [after they stop wiping], which will happen and won't just stop - they just want to get to a point where they're doing it less often. Chad clarifies that this isn't something that has been forgotten about, and that they've had a few meetings recently to discuss this but it's something they care a lot about. He thinks that they have a really good plan about what to do, long-term, about stopping the wipes, about how they can migrate data, and how they can give the gameplay programmers a methodology to ferry their data whenever they change their formats.<br />To give a little bit of hope, they are also exploring (but can't promise) potential ways to persist things more permanently sooner, which would be important things like ship purchaces or UEC - things that are seen as important to the Player's progression in the game. They're exploring possibly storing a much more course level data about them, across wipes, so that they can kind of restore Players back to where they were before - their ship might not be in the same place, their gun might not still be equipped, but like the UEC they previously earned, they still have it. That is, it's the higher priority things such as these that they will look into finding a way to persist between wipes, things that negatively affect gameplay when they're reset. Eventually they do want to stop the wipes entirely, but they're looking to start with the basics and having a long-term strategy for stopping the wipes.<br />Todd adds that another reason why they can't just stop wipes with the release of Global Persistence, is that the in-game ship prices are going to take a long time to tune in and balance, so whilst they don't want to wipe every quarter, they do need to be able to wipe when they need to do so, as they adjust the economy. Apart from just wanting to allow Players to make and keep progress as they play for their own benefit, instead of having to try and achieve their goal within 3 months, it also benefits development to do this because it helps them to test the economy and better understand if things are priced in such a way that the Player(s) can afford them within the time-frame that the Dev's are aiming for, and it depends on the telemetry that they're getting back.

Then being able to mix and match from all those other combinations of heads that we\u2019ve seen. So, it really is a little bit looking like Black Desert stuff, you can definitely change the tilt of your cheekbone, you can move it around and you can do stuff like that but it\u2019s not really actually bringing in other mesh or other character information.<br /><br />CR: Yeah, I think if I remember when I was playing with it, you sort of selected the face, hair and then you modify it and you have some really nice stuff for like the hair and altering the hair and moving some stuff around.<br /><br />JH: Yeah, they have some really cool stuff but it\u2019s not actually from what I can tell, it\u2019s not really drawing from fully another head, it\u2019s just kind of pushing and twisting and altering.<br /><br />CR: Yeah, I think one of the things that\u2019s kind of cool that we\u2019re going to try is we\u2019re going to give you those tools but we\u2019re also going to blend heads together so you can say, \u2018oh, I like that guy and I like that guy or I like this girl and I like this girl and let\u2019s merge her\u2019.

Right now we're in the process of incorporating what we have so far in the procedural technology and everything else. When we're proving out the tech and building it up and have Pascal working with guys, we have it in a kind of very controlled area. We needed to pull it away from everything else so we could focus on it.Now that we've gotten it a bit more mature, now we're pulling it together with everything else. We're seeing really good progress on that, but then we need to see what blows up, what unknown or unforeseen errors have come up and that we need to address them. We knew there would be some issues already when we put it in and we've already identified those and it came true with what we thought because our logic made sense. So we're already working on those and then we'll churn through it. Once we get all that solid and sorted so it's actually a good decent play experience for you guys, then we think that's the time to hand it over.Some of the stuff on the procedurals, it's been interesting for us working on it. There's a build with a couple different procedural planets in there and you're on one, you're there taking off in your ship, you get up, you fly away. Five minutes of flying through space later I see a distant planet and then another five minutes to actually get there, to get to that planet, which was nuts, you just start flying and we're going as fast as we can and we're going, \"Alright, cool we've got this, wait, wait, wait\", and we're just sitting there tapping our feet, tapping our feet. So that's another thing we're looking at is: you have the distances, but we also need to make sure that it makes sense for the game, I guess you could say that the distances are there and so on, but that's for design and Chris and all those guys to sort it out.", "published_at": "2016-06-06", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 13", "source": "https://youtu.be/hp5AlLytcn0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Shrike", "published_at_timestamp": 1465251642}, {"objectID": "373674130", "question": "When thinking about the AI we will find wondering places like ArcCorp. What sort of variation can we expect in appearance? Should we expect to see a few clones perhaps with different clothing or will they all look unique?", "answer": "Omar Aweidah: So it's a great question, and then ChadTheGeek was talking about the procedural generation for characters.So really how the characters work is the fact that we have a set of scanned actors and that every head that we get or every person that we get requires quite a bit of work. So that's something that will continuously build. So as we might release 10, 12, 15, whatever that will always grow. So maybe in a few years that pool of characters to pull from will be larger. So I think in the very beginning we're obviously going to have to reuse assets because we don't have necessarily a character, if there's going to be a giant city of a thousand people, that would be a thousand unique heads. So there will definitely be some physical assets being reused.But in the sense of \"Will they look like clones?\" I think the variety of clothing that we have, and the colour and the style, and then the hairstyles that go on top of that, and then the eye colour, and then the voices: I think when that's all put together to create a series of characters ... and a lot with the manufacturers that you guys have developed and what kind of clothes people wear in certain locations: all that kind of stuff. I don't feel, I don't ... well I'm pretty confident that it will not feel like this person over here is just that person over there with a different shirt. I think that it's going to look much more different than that.So, no I don't think there's going to be clones. And on top of that we're looking into some technology that we could use, and some techniques, that we would be able to actually customise their faces: like the shape of it. And that's also something that's very difficult to do but that is a goal we're shooting for is like an actual ... instead of picking a head or picking a person or a character you would be customising that and building it for yourself, for your experience. But that is something that's growing that we may introduce over a period of time but as of right now we're still trying to figure out how we want to do that and the actual control of that.So procedural generation maybe we could write some code or some code will be written to populate the planets and take assets that are properly categorized in the right folders and mix and matched together. But as of right now we have enough people where we can create those assets by hand and place them because it's actually really quick with the the new Item Port system that people are working on. It's going to not be a ... it's not a giant task to populating the world with unique characters.Adam Wieser: And that all sounds great because from a lore perspective, from a strictly lore perspective, clones are going to be a \"no go\" in the game just because ... so it would be really great have that integrated and to have the clothing and other ways of being able to make it feel like very ... a very diverse landing zone or location that you are visiting. And the clone thing is simply just ... it's not in the realm of the kind of universe that Chris wants to create. He wants to keep things ... again realistic but they also need to be fun. It's a ... he thinks it's a little bit more interesting when it's more like players or the story's humans on humans and then the alien race is there. Otherwise if we had clones that were so ... such perfect replicants of ourselves why would we be fighting the Vanduul when we could just make an army of clones and send them off to go fight our wars.OA: That sounds amazing.AW: When has that ever gone bad?

The size of it too being able to see how much size between everything. So hopefully you'll be able to be like \"alright I know there's something over in this direction I want to avoid stuff\"FS: I imagine its being about being conservative. Otherwise if you want that high risk high reward situation that's where it's starting to get more dangerous but if you're going to be more conservative about it and get a steady flow then you're going to avoid all that stuff.Calix Reneau: There's the PvP slider which will help you hedge your bets on that but ultimately you're probably not going to be able to completely avoid combat. However there's all these things in the game like the contract system. You'll be able to hire NPC's to come escort you places there's no reason you need to pull the trigger just run away from those things and let the NPC's take care of you. There's also all these support roles that we're really pushing on making interactive and deep and skill based and fun. All the things from mining, salvage to repair to running tactics in a larger ship. All these things where you might find yourself in combat you might be actively in danger zones but the thing you're doing is helping your people helping your side as opposed to harm the other side. There's the Endeavour for going for the research and hospital and the space farming even. We are building that out basically with each new ship, looking at new ways. WE got combat what else are you going to do with this ship? Are you going to do cargo are you going to do repair?FS: I'm just going to have our QA team guide me everywhere, they know everything.

It's already in the back of our mind that we're planning mission that don't necessarily always need to end with you drawing your gun or firing a weapon that you can resolve things in other ways too. So we're very conscious of that we're ready to make sure that's a part of the experience to for those that want it.CR: I'm always impressed with how resourceful communities are even in other games.

Can you tell us where it is in development and when we'll be able to see it implemented in the game?", "answer": "Well, it's actually implemented in the game right now. It's been in Arena Commander for quite awhile. The big issue is you really don't see it because it's sort of an invisible item, but it's attached via an item port to the ship. Ships like the Hornet that have armor, have the armor item attached to them and essentially the current implementation is a modifier on damages that you take. It modifies the energy damage, it modifies the ballistic damage in the same way the shield does except the armor is built to absorb ballistic damage but not be very good against absorbing energy damage and then the shield is the exact opposite case. So we actually have armor implemented in the game, you just don't visually see it. We do have plans to add the visual representation. Part of it would actually be quite easy since it's an item that gets attached so therefore that would be just adding GON on the item, and the item system already supports that. We just haven't built the reflective armor pieces you would see on your ship. The other thing we have been talking about that hasn't been fully implemented is a material swap and change. So when you change the armor on your ship, you can actually see the difference in the surface quality in the places that are armored. That is actually not that difficult to do, but it's sort of going to be wrapped up in our physicalized damage system work that we are planning to do. That is actually on Mark Abent's list of todos. But we have got some pretty deep item system refactoring for the greater good of the game that him and Paul are doing right now. The armor is actually already in there so really the key is to make it more visible and then I think it will become more apparent and have more nuance when the fully physicalized damage system is in.", "published_at": "2015-09-28", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 68", "source": "https://youtu.be/FkjfyVDhzNs", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Dex", "published_at_timestamp": 1443477905}, {"objectID": "373681420", "question": "Are there plans for other NPCs to actually pronounce the names of your characters and ships when they are talking to you?", "answer": "Well, it depends on what we're talking about.

But at the end of the day I would say that the fact that we're building a game that we've all wanted to build, that we've all dreamed about building for a long time, and we can see it coming together is a big motivation. Yeah, it's totally frustrating to see everyone out there second-guessing decisions you make, or wondering why you're late, or 'god damn, they should, are they incompetent, they're not professional, they should get this thing out' and it's hard, because development is a very complicated thing. This is a very big project, there's a lot of people we have on it. As long as I've ever made games, it's very hard to predict stuff very accurately, especially in the early days, cause there's always so much R&D. There's a lot of things you try an experiment, maybe it works, maybe it doesn't work, and anyone can tell you that manages big projects, even not software projects, just say a construction project, the bigger the thing you have with the more items or elements that have to be done, that just means there's more chance of some of those things getting messed up, or not coming out the way you expect, and you having to redo them. So anytime you've got big huge projects, there is always a level of difficulty and unpredictability. And then it's sort of frustrating to sit there and have people wonder why you're taking so long and stuff, but at the end of the day, we're going to build the game in a way no-one else has ever managed to build it, and that isn't the majority of people anyway, and to be honest with you, I\"m perfectly fine with it because, yeah I'd be frustrated if I was waiting, I want to play this game too. I mean, I'm kind of frustrated. I give people internally shit when things are late or they say, oh it was going to be here and it comes in late, and I\"m like... I give them the same sort of abuse that sometimes we get back from the community, but I think that's sort of the price you pay, and the fact that we're building something that we really care about, and the rest of the team really cares about, I think is the most important team. And you just need to develop a certain level of either pigheadedness or a thick skin, because you have to realize when you get a large group of people, you're never going to please everybody all the time. You can please most of the people most of the time, but you're never going to please all the people all the time, so what I tell everyone here on the project, and i do this myself, is I say listen, it's really important to go with what you believe in. Listen to what people are saying, take it in, and if someone says something that resonates with you, that you agree with, then that's worth considering and putting into action and doing something about.So I think one of the problems with development in more of the sort of button down public company publisher world, is that there's a lot of second-guessing where people don't necessarily trust their instincts. Not necessarily the key people on a development team, but there's always a lot of other levels, on marketing, on publishing, where they're asking do we have the right feature set, is this what the kids want today, and but I saw this other game doing this, maybe we should have this other feature, and that's the sort of noise that hurts a game. Being true to yourself is really really important, and I emphasize that with the team, and if you manage to do that, and you take in the input from the rest of the community whether it's good or bad, and just say hey, it's input, it's really great to get input, and don't let it affect you personally, and use it for the benefit that you can get from it, then I think it's fine, which is one of the reasons why I\"m perfectly fine with everyone arguing on forums about controller balance or whether they feel like the flight model's right, because people are passionate enough to really care about it, and are putting their views out there strongly, and it challenges myself and the team to make sure that what we believe in, we're doing. It doesn't mean we're going to agree with whomever's the loudest, it just means that I\"m find with the debate as long as people are fairly civil about it. It's not fun to be namecalling or putting people down, but you should strongly put forward your argument, and why you think it's right, and I'm telling you that, even though some people feel like they don't have any input or have any effect, everybody here definitely pays attention to what everyone says in the community, and we do listen, and we take on things that we think about and we try to adjust and fix, I mean, it's an ongoing process, and that's, there you are. That's how we don't lose motivation, cause we're building the game we want to build, and we know there's a lot of people behind us, supporting us in having us make that game, even if they don't vocalize it in a supportive manner, we know that their heart's in the right place.", "published_at": "2015-07-27", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 61 (2015.07.27)", "source": "https://youtu.be/f8DX2VEeREY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "charmin", "published_at_timestamp": 1438036231}, {"objectID": "373682230", "question": "When doing QA testing, past resolved bugs are often retested to make sure that new fixes don't cause them to reoccur. As this would make the test list grow uncontrollably large quickly, how do you decide when to no longer retest an old bug? And thanks for all the good work.", "answer": "Randy Vasquez: Thanks Steve!Vincent Sinatra: This is actually a really good question. So when it comes to that, usually we focus on areas that have been affected by recent code changes, like recently Mark McCall came to me said hey, we've done a bunch of changes to landing gear, so that immediately tasks us out to start focusing, checking all those old landing gear issues to make sure that those don't recur, because you know of the changes that he just implemented, to make sure that previous fixes didn't get stomped on by new changelists and so on. So i mean, that's pretty much, we try to stay focused on the things that're in motion and are still changing, and then if something hasn't changed build after build after build, we're not necessarily going to be looking at all those old issues again. If they do return we'll reopen them, but we don't necessarily focus on them.RV: Yeah and that's the thing, it's like I know, once the bugs have been through their paces, they've been resolved and fixed, once it hits a new area if we see it again we'll check the database and be like, okay, this is back, and in all honesty there've been some bugs, especially with landing gear in particular that the landing gear comes back so many timesVS: That's why I brought it up, cause poor Mark has been banging his head against the wall, I swear to god some of these bugs spend time in the Lazarus pit and rise up stronger than they were before, it's just unbelievable with some of them.RV: It is pretty crazy.", "published_at": "2016-02-15", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 05", "source": "https://youtu.be/7zK8TKfHAt0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Steve Hunter", "published_at_timestamp": 1435619444, "time": "10m23s"}, {"objectID": "373683040", "question": "With the recently announced intent to switch to a \"physics based damage of projectiles\" system, will player clothing/armor be modelled base on the materials that make them up, so that the actual location of the projectile hit on the body zones matters in determining protection, penetration, etc? Will a well placed shot at a joint where two armor plates come together cause the player more damage?Will armor repairs be as common as ship damage repairs (same overall approach and system), or will clothing/armor be discarded as it becomes too damaged?", "answer": "Travis Day: That's a very good question. A very detailed question, and I have a somewhat detailed answer for you so bear with me. Yes. As we move to the physics-based damage of projectiles - we will be doing that for energy weapons as well as ballistic weapons - there are a variety of factors that will factor into how much kinetic energy is actually applied at the impact point. We also have the concept on the ships which we will apply to the characters that it will check on the physics proxy that it hit, duck down and see what material is applied to the thing that the proxy is for - for example on this gun (shows example of yellow plastic nerf gun with plastic rail on top of the stock) if we had a physics proxy to keep you from hitting on this rail, so your character would impact it, that is then tied to the material of this which is like this yellow plastic. That yellow plastic in the material effects table would have its own set of stats that would say: \"I absorb this much kinetic energy before I allow things to pass through, it takes this amount to penetrate me,\" all of these different factors that would then further allow the bullet to pass or not pass based on the energy of the weapon and the ability of the surface to deflect that energy. If passes through, it would then hit whatever is next in line, or in the case of a character likely your skin and then apply damage as it would to your skin. So... yes, that is something really cool that falls out of the system - that we do all of these material lookups and then can determine where exactly you've hit or at least what material you've hit and then allow the bullet to pass through and adjust all of the physical properties of the bullet which then in turn adjusts the damage.So, it's something that comes out of the system for free and it's also something that is super dynamic because as we allow you to change your ammo types - so you could have a weapon that you change the barrel on and then you change the ammo for it - you'll actually feel it behave differently. If you get a different kind of armour made of a different material, you'll feel it behave differently and because the materials are set on a per-item basis, it will allow you to do things like shoot into a weak point. So, all of that coming out of one system is really cool but that's one of the things that Chris is really good about is thinking about these things in a systemic nature which is what lends itself to a lot of the emergent gameplay that we have in Arena Commander. So, we want to bring that to the FPS as well.", "published_at": "2015-05-04", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 06 (2015.05.04)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Jmsn9aURZ4Q", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Qro", "published_at_timestamp": 1430776682}, {"objectID": "373677830", "question": "Is there a possibility that we get to choose our \"home\" on a planet.

Longer term we want to have procedural new areas on planets that might be habitable, a settlement might get started, and might grow over time sim-city style.

Will eavesdropping be possible? Will I be able to hear my mutinous crew's hushed voices echo through my hull? Or listen to big time traders discuss the details of huge mergers and trade deals?", "answer": "Yes we definitely want to do VOIP chat and location based sound effects. So we're actually moving from one sound system f-mod, to another, WY, which will allow us to do more dynamic real-time filtering on sounds. We haven't decided fully on a VOIP solution, but the goal would be to have a system where if I'm walking around talking on VOIP in the game you'd hear my voice coming from where my character was, and the voice would be processed according to what my character is wearing, so under a helmet will be different to if I didn't have anything in front of my mouth. That's definitely something we want to do. In terms of eavesdropping, with that mechanic you could overhear two of your friends talking about taking over your Constellation then I'd say if they were stupid enough to say it over VOIP IN THE SHIP you'd be able to hear it if you were close enough. I don't know about the big time trades and deals, but we'll definitely be adding things into the PU that'll allow your to be an info trader, like finding out where a deal is going down, or a killing to make on a certain commodity etc. So that might not be necessarily VOIP, but perhaps more eavesdropping on NPCs talking or that kind of stuff.", "published_at": "2014-09-29", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 39 (2014.09.29)", "source": "https://youtu.be/7mTLWkxEEeo", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Felix", "published_at_timestamp": 1412028036}, {"objectID": "373685930", "question": "Will the insurance premium go up the more you lose your ship?", "answer": "So that's a pretty good question. We haven't fully balanced that sort of stuff yet. We've has discussions about obviously if someone is constantly losing their ship or ding dumb things like ramming into other people then there should be a penalty because that would happen in the real world and you don't want to encourage bad behavior, you just don't' want to punished someone for being unlucky and happening to get attacked. Because whether it's NPCs or players, you've still lost your ship. So we still have to balance that, but I would say that the general idea is if there is sort of a sniff of something like insurance fraud or bad behavior, then maybe the insurance premium would go up to dissuade you from doing things like using your ship as a ramming weapon in dogfighting. But not fully decided. That will be balance thing that we'll tune as we go along.", "published_at": "2014-01-24", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 06 (2014.01.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/NcRxuvQT3Ew", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Professor", "published_at_timestamp": 1390598024}]
