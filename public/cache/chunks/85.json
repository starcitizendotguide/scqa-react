Many centennial blooms are tended on R.aip'u\u0101ng (Kai'pua II), the center of Li\u2019tova in the Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an). Like the centennial bloom's reproduction cycle, R.aip'u\u0101ng's rotation period completes once every 100 MXY.</p><br/><h1>Description and Lifecycle</h1><br/><p>Standing half a meter tall at its highest, the centennial bloom is a small tree that varies in coloration depending on its particular cultivar. The most common variety has a sturdy, woody trunk with dark-brown and light-brown horizontal banding and dark-green elliptic leaves. Its light-pink flowers are bilaterally symmetrical and have stamens about twice as long as the flower itself. During the short time it blooms, it gives off an earthy scent. Flies and other carrion-eating bugs are its main pollinators on its world of origin, Ko\u2019li. The flower blooms for around 40 hours before it starts to wither, putting all its energy into reproduction.</p><br/><p>The centennial bloom grows a small, dark-purple berry that\u2019s eaten by local wildlife and propagated in the surrounding areas. Its native desert climate dries out the seeds in preparation for the rainy season. It takes a seed one full Xi\u2019an year to sprout. During that year, it must only be watered sporadically and must never be allowed to remain wet for more than 20 hours or the seed is in danger of rotting. Centennial blooms on R.aip\u2019u\u0101ng grown in more temperate areas are kept dry through constant, careful attention and specialized equipment that mimics the day/night cycle on Ko\u2019li. Lovers of the centennial bloom often keep theirs in a sealed arcology that automatically regulates the environment to suit the plant\u2019s needs. Over the past decade, it has increased in popularity as a shipboard plant</p><br/><h1>Importance to Li'tova</h1><br/><p>Li\u2019tova is a spiritual practice centered around the understanding of time. One of the main facets scholars contemplate is the way actions ripple backwards and forwards across time. Acknowledging the seen and unseen ramifications of one\u2019s deeds is one of the core principles in the Li\u2019tova code of ethics. Other aspects include the exploration of time as a dimension, the perception of time on an individual level through metabolic manipulation under meditation, and the measurement of time on a collective level. The centennial bloom\u2019s 100-year flowering cycle appeared to the explorers who discovered it on Ko\u2019li to be a poetic manifestation of Li\u2019tova itself. The plant was extracted from Ko\u2019li en masse before its terraforming and exported to R.aip\u2019u\u0101ng to be raised and contemplated.</p><br/><h1>End of the Cold War</h1><br/><p>At the end of the Xi\u2019an-Human Cold War in 2793 (III.1053), Emperor Kr.\u0113 invited the new ImperatorErin Toi for a tour of R.aip\u2019u\u0101ng. Though the existence of the jump point was public knowledge, Humans had long been barred from entering the \u0112\u2019aluth system. The Emperor personally clipped a branch from a centennial bloom and handed it to Toi.

Other methods could strongly encourage the Player to use a certain type of ship, but that's dangerous because Players could want to use their own ship, and Luke comments saying that they've heard people say that about the Pacheco mission, and that it's completely understandable. The reason they haven't done more missions with vehicle restrictions is because people can just cheat and use their own ships - ground vehicles are also slower, so they'd have to force Players to use them, which they don't want to do because then it'd be arbitrary and they want things to be contextual.

How do you implement a continuous beam weapon like that? Is it mostly animation while using an ultra high rate of fire and ultra low DPS? Or is it an actual beam?", "answer": "Sean Tracy: This is actually a really really good question. This comes up a lot in games where you're gonna have a pulsed laser that's really just a glorified machine gun or if you have a beam laser weapon and as everyone knows we don't have a beam weapon within Star Citizen yet. We solved this problem on an earlier project that I had worked on, a little modding project called Mechwarrior: Living Legends. They weren't continuous beams but they were there for quite some times so the problem you've got to solve is not necessarily having a long beam because we have different levels of ray casting we can do.Forrest Stephan: But continuous segments where you know where to break the beam so you know where it stops when raycasting hits its location.ST: Exactly. That's right because we've gotta show it somehow. We've gotta be able to one off the geometry so it looks good and second we've got to be able to change the length of that geometry. Now does it make sense to have one piece of geometry...FS: That just draws until it hits a distance.ST: That's two kilometers long well think of the bounding box of something like this right? So that's gonna cut out when you look away so that doesn't work really well. So what we did on the Mech Warrior project is we had segments of lasers that would just be[Draws lines with his hands that stack on top of each other]FS: That just kept stacking on top throughout and then leaving and stoppedST: Stacked on top, but then you've got other problems with that, that comes to do with draw calls so you've got one object, two draw calls, another object, two draw calls.FS: What happens if they're all one meter?ST: Two objects, another draw call and if you've got 2000 meters of that.FS: Kilometers or something, what happens.ST: Exactly. So the best way to do something like this is not necessarily to have a continuous rate of fire, is to do that raycast, you do that ray check every couple seconds, every couple milliseconds, not every frame because there's no reason to do it every frame, but to actually extend those verts you control the verts on the effect itself so it does the exact same length of that ray and then you grab those few verts and if you move it back, move it forward, move it back, move it forward.FS: Just kind of already how our projectile system works currently. For those that don't know, in the original trailer I made a bunch of particle effects and then I gave them damage and physics and all that stuff, but once we actually came out with Arena Commander and needed a more sophisticated solution to support networking and all this stuff right. We decided to switch from just a particle effect over to a cylinder, a capsule and then that capsule that would draw and shrink depending on its velocity and all these effects and then we would attach a particle effect on top of that including with an additional glow shader. So we rendered the capsules as type of glow which we have all these shader effects on it, then we can also attach a particle effect on top of that for additional effects and then the verts actually can move and stuff.That's gonna be a super fun gameplay trick, I'm really looking forward to that.ST: It's gonna be a neat effect yeah and actually what's really cool is we already got all the actual weapon fire, weapon type, we've got that all in place, all the code in place and it's really a matter of having the visuals that come alongside it. There'll be cool things like when we have scrap or when you're trying to pull out minerals and things like that from a ship.FS: Right.ST: When you're trying to get... We're calling it scrap or something like this?FS: YeahST:  But we're gonna need a beam weapon for that.FS: Yup.ST: We're gonna need some sort of beam for repair. We're gonna need some sort of beam for mining, so we need this beams anyways and again the game code is pretty much done for that, we just need a nice effect so that's kind of next up for some of the VFX guys.FS: Yup, alright.

We have a little bit where I think ... I don't know if we showed it but there's some blast ... I don't know what you would call them ... shields that come up on the flight deck so when the Gladiuses lift off and thrust away it will shield the back of the flight deck from from the blast shield.But essentially the take off mechanism will be a lot like, if you remember the original Squadron 42 trailer that Hannes did and you saw the Hornets lift up like this [hand hovering over desk] to a hover position and then \"whoosh\" accelerate out. So that's essentially how most single seat fighters will launch.Coming in it will be the same ... they'll come in and arrest ... they'll have to match velocity with the ship they are landing on, the Bengal or the Idris or whatever other ship they are landing on, and then they'll come in, match velocity and land.It's actually trickier than one would think. We are actually doing landings on Idrises at the moment on the development side and there's been a few cases of people smashing in Idris and the side of the walls. So one of actually the tasks we're working on for the landing system is to also have an automated landing system for alignment and bringing you in. Because unless the ship you are landing on is not moving it actually becomes fairly tricky. So if have, say, the Idris doing 100m/s and you're trying to land, you're actually landing faster and you've got to be ... and if it's doing any movement changes and you're doing any it can be ... it can be challenging!So we'll have the ability to hook into the \"auto landing system\" or land manually yourself but it will be the same kind of landing pad mechanic where you'd come in, and as you came in ... so basically you come in at 200 ... the IFCS would actually adjust your velocity so that as you come inside you're of course entering the ship itself so you're inheriting the ship's velocity, so if I was going 200m/s and entering and Idris at 100m/s, once I've crossed the threshold I really ... relative ... would be travelling 100m/s to the Idris flight deck. Of course we don't really want to be travelling at 100m/s while we are entering way to fast: you'd probably want to be entering around a hundred and ... if the ship was going 100m/s, the Idris, then you probably want to end up entering into it at around, I don't know, 120m/s or something?So there will be skill in doing it but it will be more the landing pad and just making sure you are coming through the opening in the door.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 82", "source": "https://youtu.be/3stBTV7QZzk", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Nimrod_77", "published_at_timestamp": 1460414681}, {"objectID": "38b4f523014e5_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "No, that would not be advisable.

If I am able to generate even 25 m/sec potential boarding parties will be hitting walls at 90 km/hour.Does the game have sufficient physics to handle this kind of damage implementation, and how effective would mag boots be in this scenario?", "answer": "So that's definitely, a pretty detailed question and approach. So what I will say is that the longer term plan for the interior grid physics is that we will simulate a certain amount of external forces. So if a ship gets hit we're planning to have a bit of that force propagate inside to the non strapped down or attached entities, one of which will be players. So you know that classic Star Wars shot where, or Star Trek really where the ship gets hit and everyone sort of staggers and braces themselves against walls. That's all stuff that long term we are planning on doing. Part of what we're doing with the physicalised EVA is some early stuff that will enable this combination of animation and procedural physical reaction to an environment.So we'll definitely do some of that and the bigger ships also in terms of they have to do a hard turn then what would be probably do even though they have their own gravity generators, is that maybe the gravity field or whatever is slightly laggy for where the ship position is. So if you're turning really fast so that the gravity in stead of being straight down is there until it can move back there. You would have a little bit of this turning effect. You see it in classic Star Wars where it's like, Empire Strikes Back \"Take evasive action!\". The two, well actually three Star Destroyers all do this [gestures with hands] you'll see people tilt on one of their bridges. We'll try to do a bit of that, I don't know if we're going to do it to the point where you could generate that much force that you would, that is being described in this question.The idea will be it's damped it wouldn't necessarily be full on, it would be a little bit of it would bleed into the interior physics stuff. Now if you turned all the gravity off inside the ship, then yes you would be in zero-g and then as things move around you're not attached to anything then we would have to probably, would have to see how to do that, because generally you would still be in the interior grid physics. So we would have to iterate through non attached entities and essentially keep them in their relative place within the overall ship. So basically they would stay in the world frame reference while the ship itself would move around. We can definitely do that but that currently would require a little extra code.So I would say longer term that potentially will happen short term that's not right on the immediate horizon for implementation.

The majority of it is art because that is what tends to take the most time but that includes everything from 'I have an idea for a ship' to in your game working in Arena Commander and eventually the full Star Citizen game. So the tricky thing with ships is: ships are going to permeate the entire game so we have to have the PU director weigh in, we have to have everyone who touches every module weigh in to make sure that the way we are doing ships now is going to work with everything that they have in mind for their chunk of the game. For that reason I think it requires a lot more checks and balances for ships, however, everything has it's own pipeline. A pipeline is a fancy way to say process of how things get done.Darian Vorlick: Or assembly line.LO: Yeah, so there is a pipeline for everything whether or not it has been formalized and it consists of people passing off different kinds of work and stopping and making sure the appropriate people are reviewing along the way.DV: A good example of that is we have a character pipeline, we have an animation pipeline. What we like to do between each phase &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; for example we'll use the ship one &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; is after we are done with the whitebox or before it goes to graybox or any tech set up there is a series of checklists that we have to go through, did we do this? Did we complete this? Did this person look at this? Is the lead or supervisor getting ready to sign off on it? Does production sign off on it? To mention Lisa's checks and balances there are a series of protocols in place to make sure certain aspects are touched upon. Same thing with the character pipeline. Same thing with the Arena Commander pipeline. Anything design or engineering related. If it's code then we have our code leads peer review the code before it gets checked into the game. So there are processes in place for all these and all the pipeline is, like Lisa said, is a process from start to finish. What does it look like? What steps are we going through? and is it going to be the same thing every single time we design that same feature? So every ship will go through that ship pipeline, every character will go through that character pipeline.LO: And the more areas something touches or the more modules it touches, the bigger it gets. There's a lot of talk about the ship pipeline, so many people review it and it touches so many things, that is why we talk about it so much. There is a little more to talk about than certain other pipelines but everything has a pipeline.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 11", "source": "https://youtu.be/9y1X4tLFdU0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "KinShadow", "published_at_timestamp": 1439849467}, {"objectID": "373681870", "question": "I'm wondering how the imminent release of Windows 10 will affect the community with regards to playing AC or SM?

I think we've got a couple of issues that are making us not want to roll it out to all our Dev level. I think we have some that will be sitting on people's laptops and desktops, but we'll definitely be working to make sure we're compatible, on Windows 10, from the beginning.

Being tired is obviously a factor and it can affect performance and how quickly things are managed, so that's a given that a good night's sleep can increase your capacity to handle things. However in terms of other things outside of work what sorts of activities can you do to improve your skills for \"production?\" Are there exercises in a software program that you can use as a resource or an extracurricular group of other producers you're a part of? Books you read to garner inspiration?", "answer": "Eric Kieron Davis: Yes. Great question.Travis Day: Okay I feel bad now. Because actually this is a fantastic question. I read this question on the forums this morning when we were picking our questions. And I was like, \"Wow that's a great question, I should just answer that.\" And I wrote him an answer in the forums.EKD: So go to the forums. Next question.TD: No, no, no. Honestly we should answer. Because it was a really good one.EKD: You already posted about it, you had some prep time. There is a lot of things you can do. There's a lot of different aspects to being a producer. And so there's a lot of different skills you can learn in different places to get ready for this kind of role. Books are great like you just talked about drive. One of my favorite kind of leadership books is \"First, Break All The Rules.\" It's fantastic. And then they have a strength one after it. And then there's the Game Developer's Handbook and there's a production book out there, there's a team leadership for the game development written by Seth Spaulding that I loved. It was just kind of overview picture of small studios. THough there's a ton of really cool books out there from very talented...TD: Dale Carnegie's \"How to Win Friends and Influence People.\"EKD: Yup, that's a fantastic one. Cause I think what's cool about this job or strange. Is that we have so many elements we can learn from so many different things, right? So being a manger at your local convenience store is still helpful for becoming a producer, right? Leading people, managing a process, being responsible, being held accountable for things. That's very important. There are tons of people out there making games all over the place with the amount of SDKs out there and the amount of opportunities nowadays. Not just including the schools that are popping up everywhere. But there's tons of cool game - I can't think of some of the websites. But there's some websites you just google, \"Looking for writer, looking for producer, looking for developer.\" Jump in on one of those and say, \"Hey I'll be your producer for it. I don't know what that means, but how can I help?\" And then try to start forming a team, and then help that team achieve one thing. Even if it's just your first sprint. Use different types of project management, scrum, agile, waterfall, the PNP program that talks about the whole large project management process. It's really cool. So there's tons of really great schooling and there's tons of different things you can focus on to be good at this job. Playing games is awesome, but that's not the only part of this job. In fact you need to love making games or making entertainment as much or more than you love playing them, to I think do this job.TD: Yeah, no there's a lot of... Like Eric has covered there's a lot of great project management training, resources, reading. There's a lot of great books on psychology and people management and dealing with people. A large part of your job is dealing with communication and individuals. You can also - another great tactic, and I've done this myself, which is learn each of the pieces of software of the team that you're dealing with. So you can actually speak to them and talk to them and understand when they describe a problem to you, what that problem means, how long it's going to take. I mean there's other things that you can't do unless you've been in the industry. But it's like, you know, a good characteristic, always stay self aware. It's kind of horrible but I'll probably spend a lot of my time at night or you know kind of \"bathroom time\" or whatever; thinking about past decisions I've made, past things I said, how I handled this interaction, and replaying it in my mind over and over. What if I did it this way? What if I did it this way? And trying to absorb some new outcome. And it's kind of like running a permanent retrospective on your life I guess. What did I mess up, what do we do okay but could be better, and what did we do well? Other things like, E3 is great we're going to go to E3 a little later today. E3, GDC, seeing old coworkers is like developing a network of mentors, respected coworkers, even if you've never worked with them before you could have people that you respect and have a relationship with. A lot of times when I have a big problem or a big question I need answering, I kind of go to what I call my Small Council, you know what I mean? I try to bounce it off as many people as possible and come to consensus of opinion.EKD: Yeah. To speak about the software thing. So to give some examples, right? Like 3ds Max, and Maya are used a lot. For production tracking: JIRA. Getting a handle on JIRA, Shotgun software, any kind of production tracking software. Microsoft Project I've seen used at a lot of companies as well.TD: Project Hansoft. And you can get free trials of all this stuff.EKD: You totally can. What other programs can people get their hands dirty with?TD: Visual Studio. Actually I think, if I am not mistaken, I think they're going to make Visual Studio free.EKD: Hey, get it.TD: I think that was an announcement recently. I can't remember exactly. But yeah visual studio. I mean learning, seriously just the basics of programming. Like there are so many tutorials out there that will teach you about what's a virtual function, what's a pointer, how do these things work, how do they interact, how to setup a program. You know and you might do something stupid like me and just make a little MS DOS calculator. But you know it gives you a little bit of a foundation that you can build from.EKD: Yeah, and I think understanding a little bit about what team - you know because being just a generic producer that helps everyone is fantastic. But you'll see as we talked about earlier with different skill sets. There might be a certain thing you have a passion about in kind of the back of your head. So I am a big fan of art, I did a lot of art growing up, I have a BFA. And so I like working around artists and helping encourage them to do a great job. Doesn't mean I don't want to work with everybody, the designers and the programmers. But that's kind of my thing that I know the most about. So I would like to help them. The more you know the better it is - to go back to another question we talked about earlier, was understanding bids and how much time people take. The more you understand about what job they're doing, not in depth but just a base knowledge. The better it is when they say, \"That will take me four days.\" You can kind of go, \"Well that seems like... normally it has only taken us two, because I know what software you're using, I know how it takes generally to make that piece of art. Because I've seen somebody else do it.\" It just helps fuel that producer inside you.TD: Yeah.EKD: So great question. I hope that answered it. That was a lot of questions, I hope we got them all.TD: Yeah, yeah.EKD: And if you have other questions always feel free to reach out to us. We love answering questions.TD: Absolutely. we'll answer you on the forums.EKD: That's right, that's right.Both: [laughing]EKD: I hope that lined up with what you said on the forum.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 08 (2015.06.22)", "source": "https://youtu.be/m5eFAdJXXSE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Zero Lambda", "published_at_timestamp": 1435010541}, {"objectID": "373682680", "question": "Regarding the player reputation system, beyond basic good/evil alignment, will career choices/actions also play into their reputation and the way they interact with NPCs and the rest of the universe? And if so, to what extent?", "answer": "Will Weissbaum: Kind of like a big part of when we were approaching how we were going to be handling the reputation system... as the writing team we didn't really like some of the way other games handled alignments with having it be very binary where it is good and evil. It feels a lot of times in games like that that you're only making one choice - you make a choice at the beginning, \"Am I going to be good or evil?\" - and after that you're not really making choices, you're just sticking with that initial one.So, we're really big fans of grey alignments... in every situation you're in, you're asking yourself, \"What is my character going to do in this situation?\" And not knowing a clear result of your actions. You know, if you want to slap someone because they're acting crazy then... maybe they'll thank you for it or maybe they'll be really pissed and try to stab you. That kind of thing.I think that will tie a lot into how the reputation system works - where all of these different organizations that you can work with or against will have their beliefs and their moralities and your actions will get them to feel more positively towards your character or more antagonistic... and that's kind of how the reputation goes.Adam Wieser: It seems like we want the scale to be more dynamic than just a simple bar - towards good or towards bad. That can definitely be affected much like how we have multiple ship companies and multiple weapon companies and they all have their own goals and the same thing here when you have different guilds, when you have different things you are going to be interacting with. They're all going to have their own scale to a certain degree that will kind of factor into this. So, the end goal is to definitely make it more dynamic than we've seen in a lot of games.WW: And, at a certain point when your reputation starts getting high enough, hopefully we can - we're still working on all this with design - but hopefully start incorporating things where the NPCs are reacting to you appropriately. Like, if you get really high reputation with the bounty hunting guild - you're a really well known bounty hunter - then criminals will start being aware of that reputation and start acting accordingly and start being more antagonistic towards you or avoiding you altogether, depending on their own personality. So, there's all of these interesting dynamics that can come out of the reputations and how you play with other groups that, if we can pull off, will be really kind of neat. So, we have a lot of work to do but...AW: It's very exciting. It's definitely something we're looking forward to digging in to and really getting the details figured out for that.WW: Yeah, we've been really flexing our muscles on this in Squadron 42 and hopefully we'll be talking about more of that conversation system and then really seeing these initial phases and how it's just going to explode wildly when it gets into the persistent universe in an awesome way.AW: Very cool.", "title": "10 For the Writers Episode 03", "source": "https://youtu.be/SGHW2e8BCm4", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "MACV1RUS", "published_at_timestamp": 1433196471}, {"objectID": "373679530", "answer": "Pete Mackay: That's a really good question. Right now, we are definitely in the analytics phase of that to try and figure out the total operating costs of hauling cargo. Because, that is a scenario... before with all of the non-cargo-hauling ships, their masses are all relatively close together, but now that we're adding the cargo ships the range of masses is getting so much larger. We have to really think about how fuel costs are going to play into that. We want to make sure that it's balanced so that it's no efficient that the big ships are the only way to make money, but the reverse of that is that we don't want to penalize players in fuel costs so much that they actually make less money than if they were using a fleet of smaller ships. We are definitely looking into making sure that both sizes of ships can be really fun to play for everybody.", "published_at_timestamp": 1431381621, "question": "What's the fuel efficiency difference between larger versus smaller ships?

As in, what programs or tools would you suggest learning to use first?", "answer": "Elwin Bachiller: So the first thing is, when I was first starting to learn Maya, which is the tool of choice for me, some guys here like to use 3DSMax, and we always bicker about it.Lance Powell: Just, for the record, we actually have one guy in house who's actually using Softimage.EB: What?LP: Yeah.EB: Oh wait, yeah, you're right.  That guy.LP: That guy.EB: So, the great thing about the world we live in right now, is that you can almost get every question that you have  about how to do something from Youtube or online.  When I was first learning how to do it, the way I did it was I went to the help page on Maya, and went to every tool one by one, and figured out what each one did by actually failing at it nonstop.  I didn't have this beautifully edited video showing me how stuff works.  So step one is literally get a copy of it.  They have student versions that are free, and start doing it.  Start from step one.  Just start doing it.LP: I started in an era that was a little bit different.  Mine was more CAD drawing on paper.  Scan that in, plot your points out...no it wasn't that bad.  But you're spot on.  I think there's great schools that can train you in how to be a very solid artist, they'll train you specifically in the use of the tool as an artist all across the board.  The ability to bring stuff to the table, the talents that the individual ahs is going to be different.  People show up with interests that lean them towards a little more technical, a little more artistic, those things, depending on the type of person you are, will almost govern your interest and your focus.  But I think to Elwin's point, there's enough material on youTube at the very least to get started.  The things you can't measure ever are passion, drive, and personal ability to grow, and those are independant of school.  SO I think the question, from my perspective, is always as an artist, am I proficient with the technology and the tolls that I'm going to be using, but more important thing is, do I give a damn about what I\"m working on and the stuff I'm doing, because that's what makes the difference between decent, good, and great.EB: Right, you make a good point, just being proficient at school is just step 1 to be able to actually produce work.  It doesn't necessarily mean the work will be good.  So, being an artist, and knowing Maya are actually two different things, two very different things.  So, the easiest one of those to get good at is just learning the tools, which you can easily do through youtube or any online resource.

It's kind of one of those things that will be configured when we get the PU more fleshed out, the basic systems are in place at the moment like our healing a spaceman article went into, FPS damage you can take, and how we're approaching it in a different way than in a normal FPS game. We'll share more as we go along, but you'll like it, we're doing it differently. Rather than calling SC a space sim, we're thinking of it as a First Person Universe, and you can pretty much go and do all these things in a high amount of detail, it just so happens that one of these things you can do is to fly ships around.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 46 (2014.11.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/FXnNwUmnl3o", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Tullis", "published_at_timestamp": 1416870046}, {"objectID": "373678720", "question": "If I am being boarded, can I use a vehicle's mounted weapon to defend myself?

But yes, you could end up harming your own ship. That's true as well for FPS gunplay, so if you were setting off grenades or shooting or whatever you're going to have to be careful where you do it, because if you do it near a window or an airlock or something you might end up blowing it out, and that.. wouldn't be very good.

So we don't... like if we say it's three months of time on your insurance, or six months, or a year on your insurance... that is game time, not play time. So if you play the game for a day and then don't come back for six months your insurance won't have run out, basically. It's basically all the things that happen in the universe are in the time of the game.It's not like real life time, it is real time in the universe. So if you're playing and you're not flying one of your ships and you've gone through three or four months of game time, then yes, you would have to keep up the insurance on them, just like you would in the real world.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 28.
