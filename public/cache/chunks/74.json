Just like you could do over in a busier area of the system but because the potential payout is less or because the density of other farmers or transit pathways or whatever is less, you\u2019ll just attract less attention. The key point there is though that you\u2019re not off isolated, you\u2019re still in the same universe, it\u2019s just that that solar system is an enormously large place and so it would be very easy for those players that really want to do these self contained, isolated activities to basically go find a little area and you know, do their own thing\u2026 but there\u2019s always the possibility that someone\u2019s going to find them and if they\u2019re actually..<br /><br />CR: Yes, you log out and you come back and your homestead\u2019s razed by the bad guys and you got to come back and track them down for vengeance.<br /><br />TZ: It\u2019s the same thing with mining you can just picture that will certainly be well known fields of very valuable elements that, you know, that loads of players are being drawn to and extract and that draws all the guys who are looking to making a quick buck and you\u2019re going to see a lot of freighter traffic.

How do you intend things given that so many \"knobs\" that you could otherwise tweak are embedded into the physics simulation?", "answer": "Travis Day: This guy definitely has some good questions. The answer to that question is both. In the same way that the damage system on the ships was introduced so that it would perform better, looks better and takes less work, the physically based damage of projectiles will reduce the workload (once everything is converted). Right now we're putting in arbitrary values for damages etc and trying to base those values on what we think should happen, where once this is introduced everything should make more sense relative to everything else. It also makes it so that the barrels for different ammunition types will have to match etc. Yes we do intend to tweak just as many and the same knobs, but they'll be a part of the physics simulation instead, changing density, size etc. They just come now with physics based names rather than arbitrary \"damage\" values.Darian Vorlick: And they can be called meaningful things, like if you want it to be depleted uranium ammunition...TD: And any changes would be standardised across ships, so if weapons are the same they'll FEEL the same, which is the cool part! If you make something a real physically based system, what comes from that are game elements that feel right to the player. That's what makes this such an important thing. AND it's easier.

I don't know whether it would make sense on something like the Constellation, but it could make sense on the 890 JUMP. It is a pretty cool idea, we actually haven't been thinking specifically about that but nice suggestion!

We are looking at the possibility of actually giving planets an orbital cycle, which would really be a seasonal cycle. I don't know about the impact of the seasonal cycle so much on markets or closing up early or late.It's a really cool idea, but I think that would not be a v1.0 idea. It certainly would be a detail and nuance that we could add later which would probably increase the immersion.So good idea, the system handles day/night stuff and we're looking at how to make the orbital stuff, so we certainly will have the data to derive that, and the question would just be how does that interface with the economy.

Then we'll cut to an in-game cinematic with you getting rescued by search and recovery or something like that.Essentially the idea is you eject, get out of it so you keep your life intact, you could zero-g look around and see what's happening out in space, and then after a certain minimum period of time, you can just say \"Ok, I'm ready to go back to the last friendly planet or location I was on,\" and then we'll put you there.I hope that answered that question, and yeah, we may think of having some techniques where, if you're in a battle or other stuff's going on, some other friends who are a part of your organization or whatever, if they rescued you, they could get a benefit or a bonus for that rather than just have the game auto-do it.

I mean I like the Star Wars sort of laser bolt stuff because I grew up seeing a lot of that in sci-fi, so obviously we have that in Star Citizen, but we're probably going to have some bigger beam weapons. Not necessarily on a fighter craft, but on a big capital ship stuff. We're talking about having that maybe on a spinal mount or maybe a really big ship-to-ship turret. So we will definitely have some beam weapons, but they'll be more for slow moving, whether it's cutting into a hull or something like that, but it won't be fighter based.
