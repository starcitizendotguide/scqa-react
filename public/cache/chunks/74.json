In each episode, two guests of opposing views are brought on to debate key issues of the day. <em>Showdown!</em> has been canceled and revived multiple times. The most recent version has continuously broadcast since 2799 and is hosted by Eria Quint. </p><br/><h1>CURRENT FORMAT</h1><br/><p>The host of <em>Showdown!</em> opens every episode with a summary of the debate topic at hand, usually a current events news story. The host then introduces guests of opposing viewpoints to present their takes on the issue and debate it with one another. Generally, two guests are present, but sometimes the host will conduct a one-on-one interview or allow three or more guests to debate with one another. As the debate progresses, the host serves as moderator, asking questions as needed. Between one and five topics are covered per episode. </p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>The concept for <em>Showdown!</em> began in 2511, on Angeli (Croshaw II). Local politicians in Quinton would join radio news anchor Upasna Dixit to debate upcoming legislation. After nine years on the air, Dixit was approached by the now defunct news network Angeli On Air (AoA) to adapt <em>Showdown!</em> as a 30-minute current events debate program. Dixit signed for an undisclosed amount and began production on the new show. The first episode aired throughout Croshaw on 9 September 2521 in a late-night time slot.</p><br/><p><em>Showdown!</em> soon became popular and was shuffled to a more popular time slot. It saw high enough ratings that in 2522, SSN/CAtv bought the rights from AoA and broadcast it for the first time to an interplanetary audience that same year. In 2523, they launched a special series of episodes where various political experts, authors, and laypeople debated the merits and drawbacks of the new United Planets of Earth government without Dixit's moderation. However, the lack of an arbiter caused conversations to go off track, leading to a drop in the show's ratings. Ratings rose again when Dixit returned in 2524.   </p><br/><p>During Dixit's run as host, <em>Showdown!</em> covered such issues as first contact with the Xi\u2019an (2530), The outbreak of the First Tevarin War (2542 - 2546), and the ascension of Ivar Messer to the newly created office of Prime Citizen (2546). Dixit chose to retire after Ivar Messer created the position of Imperator, stating that she preferred not to lead debates on pros and cons of fascism. </p><br/><p>The new host, In\u00e1cio Santos Melo, developed a confrontational moderation style in contrast to Dixit's cool and impartial one, often aligning himself against his guests in heated three-way debates. Melo was criticized by other news networks for this behavior, but <em>Showdown!</em> experienced an upswing in popularity. This tone became the program's norm even after Melo's retirement in 2588. </p><br/><p><em>Showdown!</em> has been canceled and rebooted multiple times. It ran uninterrupted from 2547 to 2619. On 09 May 2619, <em>Showdown!</em> was canceled due to a dip in ratings. It was revived from 2648 to 2662, canceled again due to a contract dispute, and then brought back to fill an empty late-night slot from 2687 to 2697. It was one of many news programs to be censored into cancellation during the power struggle between Astrid Messer VII and Samuel Messer VIII (2697 - 2701), and wasn't revived again until 2718, three years after the ascension of Galor Messer IX. This version of <em>Showdown!</em> lasted until 2789, when it was censored again by the Messer government, this time for inviting SenatorTerrence Akari of Terra (Terra III) as a guest. It was revived for the fifth time in 2799 in the run-up to the ratification of the Fair Chance Act. </p><br/><p>Since 2799, <em>Showdown!</em> has been shuffled between time slots, but has not seen another cancellation.

There most likely will be a currency for the Xi\u2019an. Most likely be a currency for the Banu. But that\u2019s a longer term aspect and you probably wouldn\u2019t trade in it. So you would \u2026 basically everything would be translated to UEC and we would just trade from there. And then maybe down the road if we got more into \u201cHey, future expansions\u201d - which by the way we have a huge amount of work already but we\u2019ve talked long term about being able to play another race like the Xi\u2019an and the Banu - in that case it would probably make sense that you would have currency for those particular races.<br /><br />TZ: Yep.<br /><br />CR: But until \u2026 while you\u2019re playing Human you will trade in UEC and there\u2019d be just a \u2026 basically a currency \u2026 just like now if I\u2019m in dollars and I\u2019m in Europe I can pay in my card in dollars even though they\u2019re translating it from \u2026 exchange rate from Euros.<br /><br />TZ: We likely wouldn\u2019t have an identical translation mechanism everywhere which means for the more economically orientated players it presents some interesting opportunities in terms of arbitrage and things like that. It becomes a commodity like anything else to where the value is one thing here and it\u2019s slightly different there and therefore you can basically accept a contract and transfer that value via whatever mechanics we come up with then ... you could make some money.<br /><br />ER: Just to be clear this is a stretch goal this one.<br /><br />TZ: Yeah.

Well, I like the challenge mainly. You come in everyday, and it's a different type of puzzle to solve. You constantly learn new things, and there's new tasks. I need to be specific. Lately I've been learning how to put ships together and then tear them apart again and that's cool to me. You go in, you see the model, you see how it's put together; you yank out the pieces, put them in the xml and then you go in the engine and you shoot it. Then it blows apart, and there's explosions everywhere.Elwin Bachiller: Yeah your favorite part is breaking all of the hard work that me and my team do.PS: Yeah, basically.EB: Yeah, that's great. Well for me the most rewarding part for me is just when the whole thing comes together and you finally get to climb into your ship, turn everything on and take off and fly. Ultimately, I mean obviously I enjoy doing all the artwork for it and the struggles you have to go through to make that happen, but when you actually get to play the asset and everything works the way it's supposed to, that's the most gratifying moment for me; cause ultimately I want an awesome game.", "published_at": "2016-03-21", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 07", "source": "https://youtu.be/9otSsylG3OI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "EarthFyre", "published_at_timestamp": 1458597254}, {"objectID": "373680140", "question": "Cheers to the PU team!

Nobody likes to see friends leave the company or moved to other parts of the project; They like to kind of keep the status quo so to speak so when that shifts the team morale sort of takes a hit. Part of the job of a producer is the momma bear factor that you like to call it. It's that support and encouragement that the producer can provide. When team morale is high, productivity is high and so it's really crucial to our job to make sure that happens.Communicating what the new structure is to the entire team, making sure there are no questions if and there are questions, make ourselves available for those developers who have questions about the new structure. Just being aware of the feel of the team and interacting with them whenever we need to update them on everything that's going on.Jason Hutchins: Jake and I were also adjusting to our roles here.

The answer to that question is both. In the same way that the damage system on the ships was introduced so that it would perform better, looks better and takes less work, the physically based damage of projectiles will reduce the workload (once everything is converted). Right now we're putting in arbitrary values for damages etc and trying to base those values on what we think should happen, where once this is introduced everything should make more sense relative to everything else. It also makes it so that the barrels for different ammunition types will have to match etc. Yes we do intend to tweak just as many and the same knobs, but they'll be a part of the physics simulation instead, changing density, size etc. They just come now with physics based names rather than arbitrary \"damage\" values.Darian Vorlick: And they can be called meaningful things, like if you want it to be depleted uranium ammunition...TD: And any changes would be standardised across ships, so if weapons are the same they'll FEEL the same, which is the cool part! If you make something a real physically based system, what comes from that are game elements that feel right to the player. That's what makes this such an important thing. AND it's easier.
