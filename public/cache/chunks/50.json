The obvious thing to do is to add a drop-shadow to the UI or just make it black, but that somewhat destroys the aesthetic of it. So what they're looking at, which they started looking at with the Gladius but isn't finished yet, is having a system where it's contextually and dynamically reading the brightness of the environment and adjusting the brightness of the UI in response to that. Additionally, to make sure the HUDs look like they exist in-world, they want them displayed on actual geometry to ground it, and they can leverage that to maybe dynamically tint the geometry that the UI is on, as well as then brightning the UI if needs be (depending on the environmental conditions). This solution is ideal because of being in-world (and thus not hindering immersion) but also because it leverages the in-game elements, making it more convincing. Jared asks for clarification, and Zane specifies that it'd involve tinting the physical glass pane but then also brighting the UI, like if you have your phone on automatic brightness and go outside into the sunlight, it'll auto-adjust to make it more readable (This is a thing?! My phone must be old). He adds that it's also an issue with the eye adaptation feature (where the Player's \"eyes\" adjust depending on how bright it is), because the UI becomes dim when you're on a planet during the daytime, as compared to being lit by the sun in space. They could potentially also have some sort of effect in the UI rendering tech, such as a blurred frosted glass effect, that could help with readability (particularly for the visor HUD in your helmet), and the same is true for busy backgrounds and not just bright ones. Regarding a potential back-shadow, or a black highlight around the words and numbers on the UI (as often suggested by backers) it's definitely something they can consider but it'll depend on how subtle it can or can't be to work, because that might not fit with the aesthetic they're aiming for, which would therefore require them looking for a different solution.

I think we'll be focusing mostly on the Stanton system for the foreseeable future getting it to a gold standard quality we're focusing on the four landing zones in Stanton; ArcCorp's Area 18, Hurston, Microtech and Crusader. So getting all those landing zones fleshed out getting it so you can actually visit those landing zones, so we'll be working with other teams across the project who are fleshing out the space portion, the spaces in-between the landing zones starting with Crusader in 2.0. Basically getting a gold standard system is going to be our near to mid term priority.Jason Hutchins: When I first joined the team over a year ago now  the idea was to be designing the first five star systems. What we did not know at that point was how long did it take us to make a single star system or even a single landing zone. Over the course of the year we really fleshed out a single landing zone and we've done most of the work needed for our second landing zone and just recently added points of interest around the Stanton star system itself. This is teaching us how long it's going to take us to do it. Even though I would say we are not one hundred percent complete with the landing zone yet once we have that, it will give us an idea how much more we need to do. So we shifted our focus from instead of the first five complete star systems to the first five landing zones.So we currently have four landing zones in Stanton. Those are landing zones, not like i'm going out to a space station to make a quick repair and getting back on. That's not a landing zone that's more like a mission. We're adding those as well. This tell us what we need to do. Then from here we'll move on to the next one which is Nyx, the Levski landing zone. A much less populated system. That's going to need a lot of activity in it as well, cause you don't want a single star system with one landing zone and that's it, how are those going to work out? This will tell us what a medium sized system takes to build, what a very small size system takes to build. Then we can look at our processes and see how we need to tweak those processes and see how we can go forward making a lot of content.JR: It will give us actual metrics which is something we don't have for some of the areas of our project. So once we get those metrics we can actually calculate ok this takes this long. If we want twenty systems by this time we know it will take this long to make.

It probably won't be massive world breaking where something happens and you all need to rush there but it may open the door for an opportunity to go to a specific location and see what's going like meet people on the street, pick up bits of information that could help lead you to other missions that are involved with that.You need to remember that once news breaks on a universal wide scale that it's already probably happened and there's always a few things that have happened in-between so it may not mean you will be able to go there and always see craziness happening right then and there but there definitely will hopefully be a way to direct you towards locations where there might be jobs, opportunities, NPCS, or other elements of the game like that that you can go and interact with and hopefully create your own story from.Will Weissbaum: Yeah hats off to Serkis and Sandi for bringing the Empire Report to life it's been a lot of fun having them as part of the AtV i've been really enjoying watching them and helping to create them, so we'd definitely like to continue that into the game and we didn't do the little asterisk earlier but everything we say now is still in development and should be taken with a grain of salt.The more procedural stuff most likely won't tie into news events but if we have a big planned event rather than just relying on mission boards or the normal job givers who really need to learn of a major outbreak of a Vanduul attack or something like that on a large scale through hearing it on the news that cues players to this is a location that something is happening on and it can be a starting point for a lot of other side missions that could be interesting.", "title": "10 for the Writers: Episode 06", "source": "https://youtu.be/yIwA54kxjOk", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Knight2631", "published_at_timestamp": 1446504578}, {"objectID": "125f4c4e9f23c6_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Yes you can, except where a specific limit is noted in the announcement post (for example, only one telescope array can be mounted despite the fact that it's a 2x1 module.)

So what is going to happen is on all our vehicles is if they have an interior like the aurora, it has a very small interior but it does have it. 300i is an example of this, if they have interiors you can move around in they will have their own local physics grid. Therefor you can someone piloting it and someone back on the bed. We have not implemented sort of life support and oxygen issues yet but the system we have in terms of the pipe system and item system is something we have that is fairly easy for us to do so some time in the future we would probably have some sort of life support system so you would only have so much oxygen or air and the ability to support so many people. possibly there would be a case where you have to many people and it stresses the system I dunno but you in the multi crew release should be able to get into a aurora and someone else get into the aurora and fly and it will have local physics.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 65", "source": "https://youtu.be/sw5N3ivfkds", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Grand Chef", "published_at_timestamp": 1441674839}, {"objectID": "373682090", "question": "Hi guys, how is the writing of the Star Citizen lore constrained by the known game mechanics?", "answer": "Adam Wieser: Yeah, it's a balancing act and it's sometimes, to be quite honest, lore is not so much constrained by the known game mechanics but more often by the unknown game mechanics. It's the stuff...the elements of ships, or weapons or worlds that we're still in the process of getting final approval on. So, when moments like that come we need to avoid getting too ultra specific on technical issues in that regard. From a lore perspective, it makes us do is probably focus less on those specifics and maybe more on the emotional story or on the emotional specifics which from a storytelling perspective is actually helpful. It makes you realize,what is this really about emotionally, what can we tap into. It does also cut both ways. For example, with the recent Genesis Starliner sale, if you look at the flight board all the places you see that you might have trips coming into we all approved the landing zones that would be on that board; because from a lore perspective you may be able to fly a Starliner into, let's say, the Hades system but there's no place for you to land there from a lore perspective because it is a pirate world and it is a dead world to a certain degree and stuff like that. Jared made a really great, funny card about Hades- 'Why would you ever go there' and it's an easter egg that you can find on the flight board if you search for it, if it's there at the right time and it was a fun little joke at the beginning but from a lore perspective we had to come in and be like, 'Oh wait, we need to do something else with this because this type of company wouldn't really fly or probably not want to fly into the system'.Cherie Heiberg: No.AW: There's definitely other stations, like the Rawley station on the moon of Odin II I mentioned earlier that's also a place where a commercial-like Starliner isn't going to go anyways. So, from a lore perspective also it's kinda like us being able to go in and be like, 'the mechanics of the game doesn't make sense for that to head there because of all these reasons we've built in'. So again, it's a balancing act and it's actually a good thing too because what it does do is it promotes in depth discussion between departments whether it's art or whether it's design. They come to us asking certain things or we go to them to get clarification so I think that makes for a good, healthy creative process all around.CH: Yeah. I feel like working with constraints can really help you narrow down what it is you finally want to do. Like if you're given like, 'here, do whatever you want in this space', you can get choice paralysis and not be able to develop your idea but since we have these conversations we can have these rules we can write by.

That's number one.  Does it fold in this way, do things deploy from this location...LP: Form follows functionEB: Exactly.  So then we'll go ahead and do a reference dig, for things that do the same thing.  Like, landing gears for example, or how guns will deploy, what does the housing actually look like, so we have tons of references to help us actually figure out those sections, and then we start figuring out how do we communicate the personality of the ship, and that'll come through, getting old Russian helicopters for MISC for example, or stealth actual contemporary stealth planes, like the SR-71, for Aegis, things like that, or like I mentioned before, Mustangs or muscle cars for things like Kruger, so we have a language that we want to define for each manufacturer, so we'll go ahead and do reference digs for those, for the elements that we want to incorporate for that look.  And it doesn't really, we'll look at sci-fi, we'll look at WWII references, so we'll grab whatever works, and take the elements that we really really like.LP: Right.  I think to also round that out is the, now that the manufacturers and the ships are starting to fit into a manufacturer, we've had to start defining what those manufacturers actually look like, so, if you, for example, come up with a new ship that is from Aegis or Anvil, well, there's a distinct language that needs to be applied to those manufacturers that gives them that particular look.  For example, MISC would be.EB: MISC would be old Russian helicopters, so it's ah, they have a lot of funky looking shapes, which is what they're basically known for, at least their older ships are like that  Some of the new ones are a little bit more streamlined, but that's cause they're new.  They're coming up with the times now.  Anvil, for example, they have a lot of fighters, military ships, they have more of sort of a blocky look to their design, Aegis is a lot sleeker, things like that so, yeah.LP: So, we're taking things forward, and moving them forward is going to be a lot more refined by manufacturers.

You're not going to have some kind of global-hold-all inventory that you can store everything in and take stuff out of from wherever. Everything works like a real inventory would, so your ship has a cargo hold, that's an inventory, that you can only store so many things in. You as a player will have your own inventory, which is an amalgamation of the clothes you're wearing, so if you're just wearing jeans and a jacket, you might have 4 small pockets worth of storage. You could get a backpack, which would add to your inventory space, or a suit of armour might have attachment points for weapons/grenades etc, which is an inventory allowance again. Hangars are inventories as well, and you can store other inventories within them. We're going to have a deep-dive into the cargo system where we explain our container system and all the aspects of it. Items go inside containers, they can go into your ship's cargo hold, which is inside your hangar. An inventory inside an inventory inside an inventory. It'll all be physically constrained to the dimensions of the item as well as the weight.

I find it incredibly exciting, and it's something that I can't wait to be a part.Travis Day: FPS. Probably ON a capital ship. I dunno, I like playing games where I get to point at what I want to die, and click. And so, I'm a huge FPS gamer - Counter-Strike, Battlefield, [muffles voice with hand] Call of Duty, ummm... I play them all... Medal of Honor, back when it was good. Anyway, so no I really enjoy FPS gameplay, and that's probably the thing I'm most looking forward to 'cause it the most unique thing about our, I think, is the addition of FPS to these giant capital spaceships.

I've played a lot of Borderlands, Left4Dead... but I never got into the hardcore FPSes, and I think it's been because I prefer using a control pad. For me, I feel more accurate with a sniper rifle when I'm using a control pad. Mouse and-TD: WHAT?!DV: Yes! I know! ... Mouse and keyboard, [shakes head]. I can do consistent headshots with a gamepad, and I can't do it with a mouse and keyboard. So, but, this is one of the first times I'm actually really looking forward to an FPS. Watching the demo that was at PAX when they, you know, disabled the core and then all of a sudden the gravity shut off - that looks exciting!

So if we have that happening, which we've got some early tests that look very promising, I think it will allow a lot more immersion in the interaction areas.Then the only issue we have is that we would need to have some control to make sure people can't be obnoxious or rude or grief people verbally.We're still figuring out how we'll be able to police that, whether we'd allow people, like you'd need an invite to say \"Is it ok if this person talks to you?\" and you say yes, then you can do all that or not.But we're gonna really try to push is on the communication and immersion side.

How does this work on whips where there are not bulkheads between the crew compartments and the cargo holds?", "answer": "Really great question, that's actually something we're digging into right now in the design. We're actually trying to figure out exactly how we bring cargo in from space.Like if you're a pirate and you're just gone and spaced someone and they've jettisoned their cargo, how do you bring it in to your cargo bay?So one way would be to have a tractor beam to help out, and the other way we're talking about is some level of EVA. You could actually get into your space suit and take a little space sled out to pick up the cargo and bring it back into your cargo hold.Obviously the ships, most of the ships that are designed for pulling cargo should have an airlock door between the cargo hold and the pilot or living quarter area so that you can space the cargo hold and you don't have to space the living quarters. If you actually had a ship that didn't have that, if you were opening up your cargo hold or spacing or whatever, you would have to basically space the whole ship. You would have to be in a EVA or space suit, whatever you want to call it, to survive that.Obviously something like an Aurora isn't really designed for that, but its cargo pod is external, so you can eject it. But most of the ships we're actually going through and designing and going:\"Ok, well we probably need an airlock door here. How do we actually physically get the cargo in if we're trying to bring it in from space or not in space.\"Because we recognize that a lot of people will actually be doing that in space besides just picking up stuff on the ground and dropping it off on the ground.In Star Citizen there actually will be much more of a game mechanic around collecting your cargo than there has been in say Privateer or Freelancer or other space sim games where you basically just run over the cargo and it's magically in your hold. You actually have to tractor it in or you have to go out and get it and put it in your hold.I think that will actually be a really cool game mechanic, and add to the fun.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 09 (2014.02.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Q4OB9Yfo-0Q", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Jomanda", "published_at_timestamp": 1393282759}, {"objectID": "373685790", "question": "Are you willing to redesign the cockpits (size of displays, fonts, field of view, etc.) once the final specs of the Oculus Rift consumer version are known if you think that is needed to be playable or enjoyable with the Oculus Rift?", "answer": "I would say that, if the Oculus Rift works correctly, we shouldn't have to do that, and we would not be redesigning ships or cockpits for one peripheral that we're going to work with.Even if it's a peripheral that everyone is excited about and we're excited about, I have a Rift sitting right on my desk right now.

When we have big ships in the dogfighting alpha, your friends will join and that will do the whole part of the co-operative stuff. In the very beginning, the very first release of the Dogfighting Module we won't have the bigger ships. Mainly because most of them haven't been built yet, I mean the Constellation is the biggest one right now. So the ships themselves in the dogfighting, there's a lot more assets that have to be built besides what you've seen in the hangar. So there's a vast amount of damage modeling and states, there's equipment that goes on the ships, shield meshes, so there's a huge amount of assets that are built. So what's going to be constraining us in the Dogfighting Module is how fast we can get the assets done. So the plan is in the beginning that you start in single seated dogfighting stuff, the Hornet, maybe a couple of the other ones like the 300i and the Aurora, and then as the assets come on line, as we finish off all the damage pieces, all the rest of the stuff, then we'd fold them in. So I wouldn't expect the bigger ships to be in the Dogfighting Module, it won't be in the first release and may not be in the second, but probably some time around mid-next-year we'd hopefully be having battles where you'd have a bunch of people on a Constellation or an Idris against a bunch of people flying other kinds of ships. Yeah, definitely. That's a big draw, that's the thing for me that I'm most excited about doing. Playing this game where I can run around and man a turret inside a gun when someone else is doing a strafing pass in their fighter. So I'm working on that.
