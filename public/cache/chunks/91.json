[{"objectID": "boxDDjWYJ7-sloma", "question": "What is the Sloma?", "answer": "<h1>Sloma</h1><br/>Sloma is a beverage often consumed by the Banu before they begin the negotiation process for new business deals, or during various social gatherings. Sloma is made up of a base liquid that is then altered by the addition of disparate ingredients brought to the table by everyone involved in the given social situation. After the concoction brews for a few moments, the resulting beverage is called sloma.<br/><h1>Known History</h1><br/><p>Since they were initially encountered, Banu have usually opened negotiations, be they political, business-related, or otherwise, with the creation and consumption of sloma. The first Banu-Human Interstellar Peace and Trade Accord was hashed out over sloma created from ingredients contributed by General Neal Socolovich and a Protectorate Trade Essosouli, among others. Because Banu do not keep historical records, there is no definitive evidence that points to the origin of the practice. The Essosouli present at the first Peace and Trade Accord, when asked about sloma, simply replied that it was how things were done. Human and Xi\u2019an xenoanthropologists believe that the practice likely began before either civilization encountered the Banu.</p><br/><h1>Details of the Practice</h1><br/><p>Before negotiations begin, either a Banu who is hosting or a Banu who has previously agreed to host will provide the slomaddon, a usually ornately decorated vessel in which sloma is prepared. It will be partially filled with one of a variety of carrier liquids. Once the slomaddon has been opened, each participant of the deal or meeting will add something to it. Spice is one of the more popular additives, as it is light, easy to carry, and can significantly alter the sloma\u2019s flavor. However, anything that is safe to eat or drink is acceptable. This can create unique flavors. Banu can safely consume food that is dangerous for Humans, Xi\u2019an, and Tevarin, so it is a good idea to request that everyone bring ingredients that are respectful of their various dietary limitations. After the sloma has macerated for a few minutes, the host will provide cups, into which they will serve the resulting drink. Everyone is expected to partake.</p><br/><p>Methods by which Banu create and consume sloma can vary: some may serve it hot, some may serve it cold, some may ask you to bring a carrier liquid and vessel, some may insist upon drinking directly from the slomaddon, some may not use liquid at all and instead offer to share food. As with the original version, participants are still expected to add something to the dish. While food isn\u2019t technically sloma, it fulfills the same purpose.</p><br/><p>Consensus among Banu is that sloma is used to ensure all involved in a contract are entering into it without ill intent. Because everyone, from low-ranking assistants to the most powerful Essosouli, must drink the sloma from the same vessel, so no one can slip poison to anyone else. Especially careful Banu may insist upon randomly mixing cups, in case someone has laced one or more of them with poison instead of the sloma. Some Banu believe that the flavor of the sloma can positively or negatively portend how negotiations will go. Other Banu attach no importance to the flavor whatsoever.</p>", "title": "Galactapedia: Sloma", "id": "boxDDjWYJ7", "slug": "sloma", "template": null, "type": "galactapedia", "published_at": "2024-10-25", "published_at_timestamp": 1729823822}, {"objectID": "bmG1Mo8q2L-taranis-2a", "answer": "Tarnis 2a is the moon of Taranis II, the second planet from the sun of the unclaimed Taranis system.

It originated as the irregularly-held Banu festival <em>tsikti efanga</em> (Glow Festival), marked by the lighting of ceremonial lamps that stay lit until their fuel is consumed (about 34,000 beats / 2 Standard Earth Days). While the lamps are burning, all Banu, no matter where they are, are considered one Souli. They invite friends, business associates, and passing strangers into their Soulis and give their guests a gift. In Banu culture, this is so that they will always have something that they could sell. All attendees are expected to provide food, drinks, and/or party favors in return, and if they can't, the host will often have those items available for purchase. Humans in the Davien system began to participate in the festival with Banu shortly after the Banu-Human Interstellar Peace and Trade Accord in 2438. Today, Banu and Humans commemorate Luminalia with gift-exchanges, present hunts, glowing lights, food and drink, limited-time discounts, decorations in green and red, and gatherings of family, friends, business associates, and acquaintances. </p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>Although its origins are unknown due to the Banu practice of not keeping historical records, <em>tsikti efanga</em> has existed at least as long as the Banu Protectorate has had contact with other civilizations. In MXY III.367 (SEY 1927), a group of Xi'an diplomats participated in a planet-wide celebration of the festival on Trise I. Initially there solely to observe Banu culture, they were surprised to see Banu suddenly hang colorful lanterns, fill them with oil, and light them. When asked what was happening, the Banu explained that it was time for <em>tsikti efanga</em>, and invited the diplomats to join in the festivities. At first they declined, but ultimately relented after repeated requests. They were then laden with gifts in exchange for samples of Xi'an cuisine, which was met with great enthusiasm from the gastronomically-curious Banu. Additionally, the diplomats witnessed multiple members of two fiercely competitive religious Soulis cheerfully exchange presents with one another. They found this especially intriguing. One diplomat wrote in his report to the Emperor, \"A curiously convivial spirit has arisen where there was once inter-House rivalry. Gifts pass freely from hand to hand, evidently without malice, even between sworn enemies.\" </p><br/><p>Another historically significant tsikti efanga was held in SEY 2441, when the members of a ship repair Souli that had been doing business on Cestulus (Davien II) in the United Nations of Earth (UNE) lit their ceremonial lamps and invited Humans to come and celebrate with them. In contrast to the cautious Xi'an diplomats, Humans did not need to be asked twice. For as long as the lanterns burned, Humans were given gifts if they contributed food, drinks, or other items to the celebration. If guests didn't have any items to provide, nearby merchants from other Soulis conveniently had some for sale at a holiday discount. As more and more Humans joined throughout the night, the party eventually grew large enough that it attracted the attention of a local news crew. The resulting story of this raucous celebration involving Humans and their then-new interstellar neighbors became one of the year's most played clips. </p><br/><p>By the time the next <em>tsikti efanga</em> occurred in December 2445, Banu presence on Davien had increased enough that artisans and small business owners located near Soulis noticed a significant boost in sales when festivities began. This success was enough to convince them to organize a night market event centered around the festival the following year. Although this did not coincide with an actual <em>tsikti efanga</em>, enough Humans and Banu participated in the market that Davien merchants were satisfied with their profits and began to hold \"Banu holiday events\" every December. Soulis soon began to light their lamps at the same time as these events to attract business of their own, and Humans started throwing private gatherings as an excuse to get together with family and friends. By the dawn of the 26th century, a Human-Banu hybrid version of the <em>tsikti efanga</em>, dubbed \"Luminalia\" by the press, had become an annual tradition on Davien.</p><br/><p>As Luminalia increased in popularity, it spread to neighboring systems with less Banu influence and further changed from its original form. Major Human-owned corporations started to mass-market special oil lamps and items for hosts to gift their guests, and for guests to bring their hosts, lessening the importance of food to the holiday. Other Human merchants modified the traditional gift sharing by hiding empty gift-wrapped packages that could be returned unopened in exchange for a surprise like a few credits or a small toy. The increased foot traffic into their stores increased holiday sales and became a tradition in its own right. A popular ad campaign featuring a Banu excited to host a celebration with their Human friends used the colors green and red to represent Luminalia, indelibly associating them with the holiday in the public consciousness. By the mid-26th century, Luminalia celebrations had become so prevalent throughout the United Empire of Earth (UEE) that it was officially added to the Human calendar in SEY 2557.", "id": "0KxWxZwaBD", "question": "What is the Luminalia?", "slug": "luminalia", "template": "Event", "title": "Galactapedia: Luminalia", "type": "galactapedia", "published_at": "2024-10-25", "published_at_timestamp": 1729823822}, {"objectID": "02kPEOz56e-rhetor-v", "answer": "Rhetor V is a gas giant, and is the fifth planet from the sun of the Rhetor system, United Empire of Earth (UEE).

Right. So not entirely related to PES, I understand the mental link between persistence and spawn points and out the four-ing and stuff. There already have been some changes in the game related to combat logging, which is basically out the four-ing while in combat to save your FPS items. Already the ships stay in the game world in 3.17 and then they basically get destroyed. Basically, that move sort of allows you to save your weapons and armor where you respond outside. So PES is not going to solve that because that's driven by game rules. So even though we have persistence, that's the thing I wanted to stress out, even though entities persist, the game rules and the game code can still decide what to do. They can override any values. If you think about respawning or things like that, same thing for logging. So for combat logging more specifically, which is a problem, obviously. It's something that we're going to want to tackle at some point, but the real fix for that is not a new persistence system. If PES solved all the world problems, that'd be awesome, but it's not the case. The real solution is a proper logout timer, where if you decide to out the four or to kill your client or whatever, you stay in the game world for that logout timer, which will allow your assailants to basically finish the job if they have to. And that makes the game fair. Most other games also do the same thing. So that's the idea that we have on the table now. Obviously, we're not tackling this specifically with PES. Even though there is persistence, it's not going to affect combat logging specifically.<br/><br/>Paul: I would add, though, because of PES, the login and logout code has to change slightly. It gives the game code teams actually the opportunity to address this issue. And as Benoit said, we're currently discussing some of the login logout flow. And as Benoit said, adding a proper logout timer to that would be a good opportunity right now to do. Another question I also saw asked a lot is, when I log out with persistent entity streaming, will I log back in where I left off? And again, to our point, let's get back to feature parity. For 3.18, we will keep our current logout system. So when you log out and you log back in, you log back at your last landing zone location. However, PES does enable all of that cool stuff. So with PES, it would be very trivial for game code to change their systems to allow you to log exactly back where you left off. However, it always comes back to how much risk do we want to add for 3.18. And also, the devil is always in the details. If we want to have game code now to completely change, okay, you log back in where you log back out, then that doesn't mean, okay, we have the tech right now, so we can just enable this feature. That means a lot of design work. Like how does it work, for example, if I am suffocating and I log out? I think the design wants you, for example, then to run a timer. And eventually when you log back in, you would be dead because you were suffocating at that moment. You want to spawn back in hospital and so on. So there's a lot of design consideration coming into play. And then also game code systems which need to handle that properly.

Putting them in the hands of players is much better than putting them in the hands of AI, (they'll definitely have AI running around) but players do the most interesting thing. That's one of their tenets for the final PU, where players drive the drama and action of the universe; to do that you need a diverse range to go after different roles while also supporting the development of the game.

We're going to try and make it something that you can have be more region-specific to your ship. So, if you really want to armour up the nose or armour up the belly of your ship if you're flying a bomber... we want that to be there. It'll just be... how much can we get worked out while still keeping that damage calculation efficient when there's 50 guns, 60 guns, however much in an instance of combat and everyone's just shooting at each other like crazy.Calix Reneau: Yeah, the longstanding notion has been that basically there's two kinds of armour. There's armour that is intrinsic to your hull because ultimately that's what your hull is - it's armour wrapped around your ship - because it's certainly not doing anything else. That's what it is there for, for the health of your ship. And if you swap out your armour item you are basically getting the general structure refitted or reinforced in the internal workings. Then there is also an additive armour which we haven't gone quite as far with in terms of implementing it. We've been focusing on the interior stuff first. But the additive armour is always going to be much more specialized - like, this armour is specifically against explosive rounds or this armour is specifically against energy weapons and will be visibly so.MS: Something else that we were sort of exploring yesterday... the idea where you have an armour where it's a really high value of armour but as you take fire, the rate that decays is much faster than the normal. So that for especially the Vanguard which is the example we were using when we were thinking of this... yeah, you have that great armour on your first pass. If you have to turn around for a second pass there may be problems.CR: Yeah, so we can tune towards attrition...MS: Or longevity...CR: Or one pass engagements, yeah. Armour is coming along quite nicely. So, it will be cool to get that whole system pushed out.MS: Yeah, it's going to be a great update when we get it all set.", "published_at": "2015-06-08", "published_at_timestamp": 1433800772, "question": "Will players be able to mix and match different armor pieces, or will they simply come as one item?", "source": "https://youtu.be/TLE_cqaY1iI", "title": "10 for the Designers: Episode 04 (2015.06.08)", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Vakarian", "time": "18m32s"}, {"objectID": "373682730", "question": "What level of detail is being put into voice chat?

He also wants to do things, depending on the type of helmet you're wearing, actually have the muffling of the helmet, or the radio static if you're over in-game radio. So there are definitely plans for that, that's something he really wants to do.As for plug-ins for different popular voice apps, I don't know that we would do that, I think we may do our own, but that's something we'll have to figure out when we get to the point where we're actually implementing in-game VOIP, determining the route we want to go, and we haven't done that yet because we haven't determined the direction we want to go.", "published_at": "2015-05-25", "title": "10 For the Producers Episode 07", "source": "https://youtu.be/_4Ml0-EedyU", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Grimyth", "published_at_timestamp": 1432581761}, {"objectID": "ac9a5d376a8c9_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Increased maneuverability and cargo space are the key benefits to the standard Starfarer.

You might be able to look up nav-maps or courses you could chart before doing the final entry back on your ship. You could have an alarm on your ship that warns you if someone boards your ship while you're exploring say a derelict ship in space. There are some cool things we have planned for that, in fact today I was looking at a prototype we have for depressurising your cockpit, opening it and EVA'ing out to a derelict ship, opening it and going inside, seeing what happened, getting a ships log, and meanwhile a vanduul attack happens and you have to rush back to your ship to get involved/get out. AC is sort of the test-bed for a lot of the ship-flying stuff we have planned for the PU and SQ42, so down the road we'll start to add some more scenario-like missions like that to AC that might be Co-Op or single player before they're all utilised in the PU.

Darkstar", "published_at_timestamp": 1421708409}, {"objectID": "373683540", "question": "What has been the biggest technical challenge for you guys that you have not yet overcome? Map size, movement in multi crew ships or something completely different?", "answer": "Well there's a lot of stuff that we're working on. One of the biggest things that we're working on is moving from single precision, which is 32-bit float, to double precision, which is 64-bit float. So we can have much larger scale maps and deal with much larger scale objects. In a first-person shooter which most 3D engines are built for (CryEngine, Unreal, etc...) everything is in 32-bit float, which is fine if you're in a limited space, say 4x4km or whatever. But we're obviously out in space with ships that, even though they're not flying at the speed of light, they're still pretty fast and can cover hundreds of thousands of km easily. So 64-bit just allows us to have a much bigger address space. It's a fairly big change because the whole engine is in 32-bit so it touches pretty much most of the engine, and we also have to work well with the rendering pipeline because the GPUs tend to be on 32-bit. So that's in progress, though I wouldn't say that it's something we don't know how to do but we're working on it. So we haven't overcome it yet but we're not worried about overcoming it - it just is a lot of work.Multi-crew ships sort of falls in a little bit with that, where we have our whole local physics simulation that happens inside the ships - which we're in the process of. So yours truly is doing some work on that, and a few other people including some talented folks at Crytek that are helping us out on that. But we've added functionality to the physics system that allows to have local physical worlds inside ships and now we're in the process of integrating that into the game. So that's also in progress, and later this year we're hoping to show you all that kind of working, which will be fun.And then I guess the other biggest technical challenge we have on the project is the overall sort of server structure. So right now we're playing multiplayer on Arena Commander but that's the local server that handles the frame-by-frame update between the ships in the area. But then there's a couple of other levels of server that we have above that. One is the system server which handles the matchmaking and co-ordination, and sort of runs what is happening in side the system in terms of which players will see each other when they go across a certain area. And the there's a universe server which keeps track of your status, your equipment, and where you are in the overall universe. So they're all in progress and we've made a lot of progress on the actual backbone, the technology, the communcation protocols... all of that. So we have \"skeletons\" of a bunch of that and some stuff is more fleshed out than other stuff.I would say those are the three big technical challenges that we're working on, and if there's any network programmers out there, we're hiring cos you can never have enough network and back-end guys.

There definitely could potentially be the ability to have gravity in between full Earth-like and zero-g, and we have things like magnetic boots that will allow you to lock down to floors when there's low gravity or zero gravity.So I guess the only question I would say is \"walking with a heavier tread or a spring in your step.\" It would probably require different animation sets because really the actual gait is controlled by the animation. I don't know it depends on whether we're actually planning to have some low-g or heavy-g environments and then potentially we'd probably change out the animation set.But generally the physics of everything is supported, it's just the footstep bit that is more animation driven.", "published_at": "2014-05-19", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 21.
