On 24 June 2610, the Tevarin Warlord Corath'thal and his forces entered the Centauri system with the Centauri-Elysium jump point as their goal, around which the UEE Navy (UEEN) had placed a blockade. Instead of charging for the jump point, Corath'thal's fleet diverted for Yar and Saisei, forcing the UEEN to break its formation and defend the populace leaving a small contingent of ships behind to protect the jump point. Captain Alexandra Dunlevy of the UEEN's 42nd Squadron, believing that this strategy would fail, convinced her commanding officer Admiral Tibault Fraser of the UEES <em>Countenance</em> to pretend to retreat under fire from the approaching Tevarin forces. As Corath'thal's fleet broke formation to enter the jump point, the 42nd Squadron ambushed them and took out their shields, giving the UEEN the opportunity to destroy a majority of the Tevarin ships. While Corath'thal and his remaining forces did manage to break the line and enter the Elysium system, they lacked the numbers to retake it. Instead, they chose to immolate themselves in the atmosphere of their former homeworld, bringing the Second Tevarin War to an end.

It was founded in 2811 by Marana River (2788-2887). Every year, the IAF awards grants and fellowships to artists who work with a wide variety of forms, including music, sculpture, dance, performance, digital media, and writing.</p><br/><h1>BACKGROUND</h1><br/><p>After graduating from Aydo Polytechnic with a degree in sculpture, heiress Marana River was able to work comfortably as an artist thanks to her family's wealth. Many of her friends, however, struggled to make art and support themselves at the same time. This difference in circumstances pushed River to research how she could provide artists like her friends with enough money to concentrate on their work without worrying about paying rent or obtaining basic necessities.</p><br/><p>Enlisting the help of her parents, River secured initial funding to hold a gala, to which she invited local businesses, government officials, celebrities, and wealthy friends. The gala was a success; in its first year, the organization raised roughly 3 million UEC. With these funds, River registered her new charity under the name Green Foundation for the Arts and hired her first employees. She continued to hold other fundraiser events alongside her annual gala, and after six years of fundraising, established an endowment of 400 million UEC. The charity awarded grants only to new artists on Green for eleven years. When it opened a second branch on Aremis (Vega II) in 2829, it was renamed the Imperial Arts Foundation and amended its mission to support new artists in all parts of the UEE.</p><br/><h1>EVENTS</h1><br/><p>The IAF sponsors two major events every year: the Green Gala and the Folk Arts and Music Fair. The Green Gala, held at the Green Museum of Art, is a red-carpet, invite-only event used to generate funds for the IAF. Celebrities and philanthropists attend alongside IAF grant recipients selected by an independent committee of arts peers. Each gala is assigned a theme to set the tone for attendees' formal dress. The Folk Arts and Music Fair, held on multiple planets on a rotating basis, is an arts festival showcasing traditional and non-traditional arts unique to each planet in the UEE. The first fair, held on Saisei (Centauri III) in 2847, honored traditional Saisei instrument craft.</p><br/><h1>AWARDS</h1><br/><p>In addition to grants, the IAF gives out awards to artists who demonstrate outstanding potential. Those early in their careers are given the River's Promise Award and a monetary prize. The Eminence Award is given to artists who have benefited from IAF grants and have gone on to achieve prominence in their chosen discipline.

Whats the maximum you are planning?", "answer": "This is a difficult question to answer, and the best answer we can give at the moment is that it depends.<br/><br/>Assuming that the question is about the limit of how many players will be able to see each other from a client view, it's mainly dictated by the game client. This is due to client-side simulation, such as physics and game code, as well as rendering cost.<br/><br/>Additionally, it also heavily depends on the scenario; 100 players in FPS combat are cheaper to simulate and render on the client than 100 players fighting in single-seater spaceships, firing missiles and lasers at each other.<br/><br/>The Graphics team is actively working on Vulkan, which will allow us to increase draw calls and should improve how many players/ships we can render at the same time, while the Engine team is heavily focused on game-code optimizations to increase the number of game objects that we can simulate at once.<br/><br/>We're aiming to increase our player count and our expectation is that we will support scenarios where 100 players can see each other at reasonable framerates. However, as we start scaling our shards to support higher player counts, the likelihood that every single player within a shard can go to the same physical location and see each other without performance issues will decrease. <br/><br/>This is where we will need to start implementing game mechanics that prevent these scenarios from happening too frequently.<br/><br/>The absolute limit is hard to predict until some of the new technology comes online and we can start to measure performance.", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/18397-Server-Meshing-And-Persistent-Streaming-Q-A", "published_at_timestamp": 1636502400, "title": "Server Meshing and Persistent Streaming Q&A", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "2683408001", "question": "Atmospheric Room System", "answer": "The Room System has been in the game for quite a while and fully works including equalization of gases / atmosphere between room volumes (including dissipation into the global room aka open space / vacuum)<br/><br/>When you suffocate for lack of oxygen that is because you are in a \"room\" with not enough oxygen.<br/><br/>The Room System is basically how the game describes volumes of gas, their pressure, density and temperature so a planet has a room (it's atmosphere) a ship has rooms (various compartments between bulkheads), even \"The Coil\" in Squadron 42 has it's volume described by a \"room\".<br/><br/>We use it for the Player Status System (breathing oxygen), for atmospheric flight (the room system contains all the information in terms of density and composition of the atmosphere in terms of gasses that flight model uses to calculate drag and lift), weather (some of the current weather ground FX are partly influenced by the room's temperature, density and even composition of gasses in the atmosphere), contrails (in atmosphere and in space gas clouds) and atmospheric entry effects on ships.<br/><br/>So the Room System is very important for a lot of systems and has been been in Star Citizen for years.<br/><br/>What @MGibson-cig was saying and may have been lost in translation as you don't know our internal terms is that rooms can have two states; mutable and immutable. Mutable means that the room has a finite amount of density / pressure / gasses which can pass to another room if it is connected to it and there is a difference in pressure. So if you open an door to space from your Aurora if the internal room is set to mutable the atmosphere inside will escape outside. Immutable means the room has what is considered an infinite amount of gas and it's pressure won't change. Planet Atmospheres are immutable rooms, as is the vacuum of space. When we first set up rooms on the vehicles we didn't have the life support component (and it's related vents) implemented yet so we had no way to supply more oxygen to a room that had lost it, so the designers set the ship rooms to immutable (infinite supply of oxygen basically) as a temporary measure because otherwise if you opened your door in space you would lose your internal breathable atmosphere and suffocate if you didn't have a space suit on. All ships have rooms, and in fact why people occasionally suffocate on a ship in some places is because the room volume hasn't been set up correctly and there is some part of the ship without a room, and without a room there is no atmosphere and the game treats everything outside a room as vacuum.<br/><br/>We have the initial implementation of life support components and their connected vents working internally but rolling it out for the ships will take a while as we need to literally \"plumb\" the ships with a set of extra components, not just the life support component but all it's vents. We have a few other systemic ship features like more interactive cockpits (DCS style) we've been working on, as well as the dynamic fire system (which also uses and affects the room / atmosphere) and an update to the \"pipe\" system that shares resources like power, heat, fuel, atmosphere between components that will be more flexible and scalable so it's really a matter of scheduling when we do passes on our huge number of ships to set them up for the new systems that are waiting and the ones to be ready soon; As everyone always has more work than time it is going to be more efficient to update multiple things once we crack open a ship to update it, hence some of the functionality we have waiting in the wings hasn't been rolled out just yet.<br/><br/>There is a lot of very cool systemic gameplay that we've been working to finish off in the background for ships that once all together will create a spaceship simulation like no other. Let me give you an example that factors in our new physical damage (that we are working on as I type; this is one of things that I'm pretty involved in), fire, room, pipe and player status systems.<br/><br/>A ballistic round passes through the ship's shield, which scrubs off some of its kinetic energy but not enough as the round's velocity was high as was its mass as it was an armor piercing round. It manages to penetrate the armor and strikes an internal component, say a power relay node (something else we are working on as part of the pipe system refactor). The power node takes damage giving it a chance to \"misfire\" while in use. A few minutes later the node does misfire, blowing its fuse and resulting in it catching fire. The crew of the ship doesn't realize a fire has broken out in one of the side corridors, as they are busily concentrating on fighting the ships attacking them. The fire starts to spread along flammable surfaces, and as the fire starts to engulf other components they also catch fire. The engineer on the bridge of the ship sees his console flash red giving him a warning that several components have failed and looking at his ships schematic he sees a fire has broken out below decks. The engineer decides to seal the bulkhead doors on the corridor to contain the fire but the doors have no power as the power node is out! He comms one of his crew mates to leave his turret and grab an extinguisher and put out the blaze which is slowly creeping towards the power plant room. Fire reaching a ship's power plant or it's ammo stores are two sure fire ways for your ship to go boom. With the physical damage system ships will no longer just explode when their hit points reach zero, they'll explode because something inside them went critical and exploded (due to damage or heat), which then damages everything else. Outside of that damage will affect the ability of the ship to function or it's structural integrity so they also could become a lifeless hulk as much as they could go up in a flash of light. When the crew member gets to the corridor where the fire has broken out is has already consumed a huge amount of oxygen in that \"room\" (the corridor) and has released noxious gasses, so the crew member can't breathe and quickly retreats to put on a fire resistant suit and helmet. The engineer in desperation manages to reroute power away from the destroyed node through a secondary node restoring power to enough of the bulkhead doors to allow him to contain the fire. Noticing that there is an external airlock in the sealed off area he opens the airlock, venting the oxygen in the sealed off corridors and rooms to the vacuum of space, depriving the fire of the ability to burn, putting most of it out. By this time the crew member is suitably dressed and can extinguish the fire that made it past the bulkhead door before it can grow again. The engineer then reseals the airlock and allows the life support system to replenish the air in the vented part of the ship. Once done the engineer opens up the bulkhead door allowing the crewmember in with a replacement fuse for the power node, restoring power to that section of the ship, then returns to his turret. It's been a close call but the ship is still alive and in the fight!<br/><br/>What I describe will be possible once we have finished and deployed the systems we're working on. I know it can be frustrating to wait for all of this functionality to be online but I promise you everyone is working as hard and as smartly as possible to get there; we are just going for a higher level of systemic gameplay (versus scripted) than most if not all games, and to architect all of this so it works in multiplayer at scale is no small feat.<br/><br/>I am very invested in making Star Citizen's gameplay as systemic as possible as I think this will open up so many possibilities of emergent and immersive gameplay. The downside of this approach is that it takes longer to see results as opposed to scripting actions as you have to build the fundamental systems first and have them interact with each other before the full extent of the gameplay becomes apparent. But for the long term, and for people's ability to lose themselves in the universe of Star Citizen for many years to come it is the approach that will have the best results.", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/3/thread/atmospheric-room-system-4-years-later/3366236", "user": "Camural", "title": "Ask The Devs", "type": "spectrum", "published_at_timestamp": 1599613200}, {"objectID": "25747571", "question": "Pyro has a lava planet, are we going to see lava flow everywhere or will it be static?

We know about rocks and grass, but what about life forms and plant life? Basically I'm asking about the blending of artist created content and procedural content, what's the mix like?", "answer": "Our plan is to have all levels of planet from sort of the basic sort of rocky, barren planet which we sort of showed a little bit of when we showed the tech at the end of last year, and by the way that's moved on pretty significantly from where it was when we showed you last year, so that's looking a lot, lot better. But, ultimately, to take it to the level where you get a Crysis level, which includes things like obviously the grass, which you mention the rocks, the vegetation, trees, plants, water, oceans, streams, wildlife, alien wildlife, birds in the sky, all that sort of stuff. Ultimately, our goal will be to create ecosystems and some certain level of weather and stuff like that on these planets.So that's sort of our roadmap and what our goal is to use the procedural tools to sort of generate massive play areas cause an artist can't do that by hand, but it's very much sort of Artist overseen and Designer overseen. So we don't just have a formula and it just creates stuff and that's all it is. It's using those tools to create these areas, and then the Designers and Artists are influencing it by looking at areas and tweaking it, essentially doing a little guide, hints to the procedural system of what they want to see in this area. They want this to be sort of a plain, or is this mountainous, or is this going to be a desert, or all these kinds of things.We'll also try to have some ecosystems with some of the wildlife, and allow us to place down a lot of emergent gameplay that isn't necessarily around like landing areas, cause landing areas are very cool, and we build those and we'll build a lot of those out of pre-fab sets so we can build some fairly quickly, and some of it will be pretty bespoke because yeah, Earth is going to be Earth, and Terra is going to be Terra. But it's a big universe and we've got a lot of stuff to populate.So, we also need areas where you can land, and for instance maybe you are going around as a miner looking for minerals, or all these sort of things that once we have a procedural world, we can open up where you go down and look for natural resources. Those can be generated procedurally, and then players can go down and mine. We can also create all sorts of missions down on planets, like for instance a supply mission; there's like scientific outposts that we just sort of have this couple different sort of temporary science outposts or installations and the mission is to take supplies to them, but you can't land your ship nearby where the outpost is, so you have to land it at the closest available area and then load up the supplies into your buggy or whatever vehicle you have, and drive it up to them and deliver it to get payment.Maybe there's a downed ship that you have to rescue off a planet, and we can have farmers or settlers. So there's a lot of kind of fun sort of almost mission based immersion stuff that we can have so it's not just about spawning stuff out in space, there could be stuff that spawns down on planet's surfaces that cause destinations for you to do stuff. So that's very much like what Tony, and I, and Todd Pappy have been talking about in terms of like the mission, sort of the bigger mission immersion setup that we're going to do in the procedural universe. It will be very cool and it will be done to the fidelity that we sort of achieve to, and you'll see, which is very tactile, very there, seeing it actually happen.I think that's the strength of Star Citizen is that instead of it being very big picture, very pulled back, it's there looking at you. Like you're in your ship and you can see the seat and the controls, and you get up, and you can go get in a bed or get in a shower, or go to the toilet, or sit down at the dining table, and everything's there. You can touch and use it so it feels real. We want that level of interaction with fidelity throughout the whole game. So we won't be able to do four hundred billion star systems like that, but we'll certainly be able to do quite a few using procedural tools. I think it will feel really rich, and really dense, and really cool. You have the tools in such a way that the players actions are generating interest and action for other players or other NPCs. I think it will be a really, really, pretty cool experience. So yeah, I'm very excited.

We don't necessarily want you going into the game with more information than your character or reasonable character in the universe would have. So knowing all this deep history about the Vanduul isn't something the UEE itself has learned yet.

In the game world, the way that the shaders are set up and the textures are being ported too is that when you purchase the ship, it will be pristine. Just like purchasing a new car. You drive it off the lot, it's brand new. As soon as it gets off the lot, it's never really brand new again, you know your value goes down. And then we start factoring in the code that will kind of procedurally blend in the wear over time. It'll kinda be like a Grand Theft Auto type of thing, I think we're taking your space garage and get it cleaned up and washed and detailed I guess...So, these are new systems that we've been working on and coming online. A lot of the earlier ships were just get it in there, lets see how it works, how it looks like &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; wear it up a little bit &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; but now we're starting to backtrack, and you'll notice that the newer ships like the Retaliator and whatnot, has much cleaner materials, and then we're going to figure out how we're going to start blending in that wear because that is something that we definitely want to do.Omar Aweidah: Yeah, we're still early on in that technology, but we kinda know how we want to do it. We pretty much know how to do it, and then a lot of it is retrofitting and stuff like that. Also, I think for industrial ships, they're never... they'll come with a little bit of wear probably, like you normally would if you're making on an industrial scale, but it'll never get cleaner than when you buy it.FS: Absolutely. For sure. But even the clothing, like we're messing with jeans and stuff. So even the PU clothing is going to wear over time. Jeans start getting faded, start getting dirt on the bottom of your pants, which is kinda cool. So the whole system around all the items in the game and the ships, and the characters, are going to have some kind of wearing and be pristine when you purchase it, and that's cool, cause you sell it, it's used, it looks kinda dirty...OA: That'll probably be the first demonstration for people to see would probably be the clothing, because it's simpler for us to kind of start off fresh with, like a fresh shirt, and do all the tests we need to do.

We're looking at manoeuvring thrusters deriving the majority of their power from the main engine. To have a functional spacecraft you really need to have comparable thrust on all axis. Imagine having only large thrusters in one direction, sure you could get up to speed, but good luck stopping. To make up for that, we've made the thrusters to have much larger capacity than you'd expect give their size. As a consequence, if you lose your engine, you can still fly pretty well at the moment. We're looking to rectify that by making the extra power come from the main engine, so if that's lost, you'll have fairly weak thrusters and slide around a bit. As far as controls and manoeuvrability goes, I think we need to wait to see what cargo does to the mix, because a heavy cargo ship will definitely not handle the same as something like the hornet that was designed to be a dogfighter.Dan Tracey: Since now everything added is adding mass to your ship, you'll really want to examine where things are placed. If you're placing your heavy cargo near your centre of gravity, or storing a lot of ammo for your ship's guns etc it'll have an effect. Even if you've got a heavy cannon on one wing of your hornet and a light repeater on the other, the ammo storage and additional weight of that cannon will throw your flight model off a bit. Definitely something that needs considering.CR: Symmetry is going to matter, because these engines create so much torque. There's even a bug where the 350r at the moment can lose 1 engine, which KILLS acceleration, not because of the reduced capacity per-se, but because that offset engine creates so much rotational torque it has to operate at like, 5% capacity in order to be compensated for.DT: IFCS is saving you in that case!", "published_at_timestamp": 1423522808, "question": "I'm wondering if there are any plans on iterating on the thrust power of the maneuvering thrusters? I miss the sliding about and dislike that there's a magic button that allows me to turn on a dime instantly. I miss the old concept of being able to rotate the ship and then use the main thruster to truly effect a quick vector change.", "source": "https://youtu.be/eb01zlo_MvM", "title": "10 for the Designers: Episode 01 (2015.02.09)", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Dostro", "time": "22m14s"}, {"objectID": "373677700", "question": "What are some avenues of community contribution (existing or new) which you would think would be a good way for new backers to engage and contribute to the game?", "answer": "Travis Day: So, my first recommendation would be to go back and watch every episode of every piece of content that we've ever released, so you don't run the risk of asking the same question somebody else has asked. Absolutely paramount importance! If you DON'T have hundreds of hours on your time, I think that probably the easiest way to contribute to the community is to jump into the forums and the RSI Chatroll. That's probably the two most common places where developers go to interact, to read, to lurk, to troll... sometimes! But, you know, probably some of the better ideas and the better theory-crafting that we've seen is in the forums and on the chatroll, so getting in there, participating in conversations, opening up threads about things that you're concerned about, or even just things that you're happy about, or excited to see would be very much encouraged! Because it is something that all of us read. There's 280 of us around the world - it's a lot of eyes on the forums, not as many as there are people on the forums, but... that would be my recommendation.Darian Vorlick: I'd say my recommendation is, looking on the different forums you can see regionally what players are from your area, and if any of them have any organizations or get-togethers. One of the interesting things I've found about Star Citizen is that there are a lot of community-based events that players throw, backers throw. So find some like-minded individuals who are within your region, or at least within a reasonable amount of travel, get to know them, contribute to discussions on the forums. A lot of people have seen me making contributory posts commenting on other peoples' sometimes humorous, sometimes serious questions. So, it's highly encourage to interact, and we try to interact with you, so it's a good way to get yourself immersed into the game, find out more about it, and see which aspects that you are going to be looking forward to the most. But most of all, I don't think there's a direct plan of attack that we would recommend specifically to, like, \"hey, you need to do this\". Come up with your own! Find out an interesting way - if we like the idea we'll see what we can do with it.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 01 (2014.12.08)", "source": "https://youtu.be/8Vjztd8mgjw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Archilele", "published_at_timestamp": 1418080393}, {"objectID": "373678510", "question": "With the release of the new development pipeline for ships, has CIG any plans for a ship balance pipeline? How do you see ship balancing going forward?", "answer": "So the answer is yes, we're actually-... the balancing of the ships is part of the pipeline. And we're also putting processes in place, so like one of the checklists for the QA department (who obviously do the most playing with all the stuff) is that we also have sort of a balancing pass now that's part of the sign-off of our big releases. So that, you know, we can say \"okay, well this is how the Hornet compares to the Aurora, compares to the 300i,\" and have that sort of part of an instituted process. Because there's so many things going on, and we always... and we've actually had this in a couple of cases where, someone changes something down in some other area and it actually has an effect on a ship that we didn't even know it would, but we don't really catch it 'cause everyone was focusing on testing other areas of the game. So we're trying to make sure that that side is sort of... has check-listed, and then we're also specifically having a focus internally on the design and technical side to do that.So, I don't know whether that's gonna be full in for 13.2, because there's a lot of stuff to be done, but going forward, definitely for release 1.0 of Arena Commander that'll be there. It's something that we're focusing on because the balancing is obviously something that's really important, and it's the opportunity we get right now with Arena Commander, 'cause you know, the beauty of it is we have these builds out there and you guys give us feedback, and yes sometimes things get broken, and sometimes things aren't as much fun or whatever, but that's the whole point of sort of honing in what will be the best balance of, you know, the different comparison between the ships, because of course every ship can't be equal. I mean, we've got a huge universe out there and there's gonna be a lot of progression, and plus there's gonna be different sizes of ships. So, you know, yes the Aurora shouldn't be able to go 1-on... same pilot, 1-on-1 a Hornet should beat an Aurora... but a better pilot in an Aurora than a sort of bad pilot in a Hornet - the Aurora should win, right? So we sort of need to balance these things and keep on top of that as we add new systems and features in, and so it just requires a lot of process to get that.So that's definitely something we are focusing on, but I really do believe by the time the game actually is \"done\" (not that it will ever be \"done\" but, you know, is in the sort of state where the base features are all there and everyone can blend around the Persistent Universe) it will actually be a really good experience. I mean, we'll certainly have gotten a lot of the network and connection kinks, and graphical issues and performance issues, and all that out the way... and the balancing issues. So I think you're all helping make a much better, polished game. It's one of the reasons why I'm pretty confident it will be a really good game, 'cause I think the overall promise of it, the overall concept, the base gameplay mechanics of travelling between worlds and performing missions, or buying and selling goods, and upgrading your ship, we all know would work. Because we've loved that from Privateer and even the very early days of Elite - a long, long time ago - and Freelancer, and all this kind of stuff. So what we're adding to it is the sort of level of polish, and immersion, and detail, and all these extra things you always wished and dreamed you could do, that you couldn't do in the past, and you know, now we have sort of the ability to do it, and thanks to you guys we have the resources to do it. So all the balancing feedback that goes on it really useful.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 41 (2014.10.13)", "source": "https://youtu.be/4GflyTrFtTo", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Maggus", "published_at_timestamp": 1413243710}, {"objectID": "373678880", "question": "The Murray Cup Racing map, New Horizon Speedway, seems to be a few thousand feet above a planet surface. Are there any planetary gravity or atmospheric effects (e.g. wind resistance) added to the flight physics for that map? If not, would various such conditions be considered for future race courses?", "answer": "We actually... there is actually a very small amount of gravity that's supplied on the Murray Cup racing map, the New Horizon. I'm not sure if we've put wind resistance in there. The engine actually supports it - it is actually just a setting that you do, and we removed it for everything obviously in space, but I'm not sure if someone put it back in for that particular map. But there definitely will be some other areas where, I think on some races it'll be all out in space, some races would be closer to a planetary surface and they would have more atmospheric effects or more gravitational pull and stuff. And that could also cause, or create, some interesting twists in the racing. So it's still early days on that and there will be more stuff to be done there, but a lot of the engine already supports that kind of stuff.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 37 (2014.09.15)", "source": "https://youtu.be/HJnqq7DX68A", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Holo-san Voidrax", "published_at_timestamp": 1410816374}, {"objectID": "373679320", "question": "Just wondering about the possibility of finding yourself stuck planetside. If your character is already in severe debt (and can't get another loan as a result), this could lead to some unique and interesting interactions. If there were ways for a player to earn money on the surface, such as courier missions or even just mundane jobs, this could function as a catch-all to prevent bankruptcy and greatly increase immersion.", "answer": "So yeah, that's a great idea. I mean, I've actually... Tony Zurovec and I have been discussing how to really make missions beyond just the standard sort of space missions where, like \"okay, let's take this item from planet A to planet B\" or \"let's escort this ship from planet A to planet B\" ... \"let's go after this ship\" ... you know, the sort of standard space stuff... how we can really take advantage of one of the special things about Star Citizen, which is basically it's all based around a kinda first-person engine. So we walk around in high fidelity, then we get in our ships and fly around, so we have high fidelity down on the planet-side environments, or in environments up in space like a space station. I think we're really thinking about how to sort of take advantage of that, because for us it's fairly low-hanging fruit because we're gonna have all the motion sets, we've got all the combat stuff already there, so it's really more a matter of creating some environments and populating some AI.So we'll definitely have some non-ship-based kind of missions, so potentially that would be stuff that you could potentially try and do. And then obviously if you were in debt and you can't get another loan, you certainly would be able to take jobs - and by the way you can take, like as a pilot, like as a trucker, or as a hired gun to fly someone else's ship. So those would always be available as well, and we'd probably add in some kind of planetary-side stuff because we're sort of thinking about elements to do that pretty well. And I think that's one of the things that's going to really make Star Citizen in the long run sort of shine. So, it's a lot of stuff to get done, right, we're super early, I mean what people are playing is even just a small portion of the space stuff. But all of the stuff we have longer-term coming down the pipe I think is really going to flesh it out in a way that people will be really happy with. It just isn't all happening tomorrow, but that's the nature of the beast when it's such a big ambitious game, but you guys will be along the way with us the whole time on the journey - sharing it, experiencing it as we're getting it to work, and I think it's a great way to make games.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 32 (2014.08.04)", "source": "https://youtu.be/NM0DVz1VcvY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Almighty Verb", "published_at_timestamp": 1407189612}, {"objectID": "373683280", "question": "As an organization leader I am interested in some of the future in-game organizational modules / utilities you have planned to aid in the running of the business / trade side of the verse, such as accounting, market costs for resources such as fuel, ore, etc.", "answer": "Ok, so I assume that question is about what kind of applications or interfaces we're looking to allow, for people to manage the logistics of their organisation. The answer is we're going to do a fair amount. We're going to do a lot on our Roberts Space Industries site - so we already have the very beginning of the organization stuff, but that's going to expand as game features come online in the Persistent Universe, in terms of managing the assets of the organization, the finances of it, being able to assign jobs or tasks to people, and we'll let you see a lot of that on the website.We're also planning on building some mobile apps, or you know, tablet apps, that will also allow you to do that and interface and manage the logistics, or check in on who's accepted missions, what missions are out there, what the current news it in the universe... So we're definitely going to have a fairly big suite of that. Obviously it's not going to be the stuff that's like... that won't be before the stuff that's actually happening in the Persistent Universe, but we do some of that in parallel, so Turbulent who do all our web stuff and do great stuff - they're building the organization system and then we're also going to be replicating that inside the Persistent Universe. So that's sort of lock-step there, and then at some point once we've got enough of a suite of that then we'll drop that down into specific applications that will be working on things like tablets and phones and stuff.The idea is that even if you're not sitting at a desktop, you'll be able to plug into the universe and sort of see what's happening, or maybe set up a mission for later, or manage some resources, or get notifications of stuff that's happening so when you get back onto your desktop (or powerful laptop) you'll be ready and prepared.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 30.

So the matchmaking criteria is on a whole bunch of things. It's on things like ping, obviously we don't want to be putting people together where there's a huge latency. It's on whether who's your friends, who's your enemy, who's your people of interest. Also it would have some level of skill rating in there. So we'll kind of track are you a new player or are you super experienced. And based on that, in most of the areas, because some areas there won't be any, it will be whoever is there verses PvP or not. But if you basically said \"Hey I would prefer to have more PvE than PvP,\" it would give a preference to the AI flying around rather than real player. So if there's an AI pirate and there's a real player pirate, it would drop the AI pirate into your instance to fight if you were more towards PvE than PvP.You defintiely would get other players streamed into your space that wouldn't be hostile, say maybe a friend of yours or something. So you could definitely get a co-op kind of feeling, and that's going to be an on-going process, but the whole idea of it is: you should be able to fly around in the game and if you wanted that more Privateer/Freelancer experience that's kind of what will happen to you.It will just be you'll mostly see AI and then if there's other players it will be probably friendly players, or if you're in like certain areas of space where there's no holds barred, it definitely could be an unfriendly player. But you'll sort of know that ok, well those are the dangerous areas. So if you're a new player and you don't really want to be dealing with tough other players, then you probably should avoid those.I would like to say one other thing, you definitely can have NPCs that are tougher than any player could ever be. It's a computer that runs it, it knows exactly where you are and it can calculate the correct firing solution much better than a player could ever do, so I think it is a bit of a misnomer to think that NPCs aren't necessarily as tough as real players. In some cases, NPCs could be tougher than real players.But essentially the slider just sort of allows you to effect the kind of people that will stream into your space as you're traveling across the galaxy, and hopefully that will mean if you want to play a more Privateer style game, and be just by yourself, you can have that experience. If you want to play with your friends and co-op against AI, that can happen. But also if you want to mix it up with other players, that will happen too.And you know, we'll have some other stuff. I mean I know there's always the question where people are always worried that's an exploit if you can change it dynamically, and we're not going to let you change it dynamically as you're flying around.So it's kind of a setting you have as you fly around, and as I said, there are some areas that are kind of no-holds-barred, and those areas will also have some really cool stuff in, so I'm hoping at some point you'll get brave enough and you get good enough and you'll go to some of these areas to get this one particular kind of weapon that you can't get elsewhere or salvage an alien wreck, but you have to take some risks to get there. So it's a sort of risk-reward basis. So I hope that answered the question on the PvP slider.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 01 (2013.12.06)", "source": "https://youtu.be/QACEabB_8lA", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Ice", "time": "6m33s", "published_at_timestamp": 1391813631}]
