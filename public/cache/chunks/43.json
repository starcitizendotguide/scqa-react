A script that has yet to be deciphered is engraved upon it on one side. It was most likely sculpted by the original inhabitants of Terra, who disappeared under unknown circumstances millennia before Human colonization. In the years since it was discovered in 2832, the fragment has been the focus of debate among archaeologists, linguists, and the scientific community.</p><br/><h1>Description</h1><br/><p>The Vasli Fragment is a large granodiorite stone bearing an inscription on the face. The stone is dark grey in tint, with yellow crystalline streaks and swirls. The front surface is polished with an archaic script deeply incised upon it. A splash of silver and spots of polished yellow agate coat the left-side of the fragment, obscuring some of the text. The sides of the stone are smoothed from water erosion and show evidence of having been attached to a larger monument at some point, although no other fragments have ever been discovered.</p><br/><h1>Discovery</h1><br/><p>In the Summer of 2832, the University of Earth at Australia (UEA) conducted an archaeological expedition to Zaffre Bay near Prime on Terra. The fragment was discovered around 150 km from the city, amid a haul of otherwise unremarkable debris. The leader of the expedition, Dr. Kleina Vasli, identified the markings on the stone as an inscription in an unknown language that she later named Terran A.</p><br/><p>The fragment was taken to the Quasi Institute for Xenological Studies (QIXS) for analysis. Dr. Vasli and the linguists at QIXS connected the script to markers found at the Quasi ruins. This was the first time substantial writing samples had been discovered from the civilization that once inhabited Terra (nicknamed \"Atlanteans\" in popular culture). Over the next two years, linguists attempted to decipher the script but were unable to crack it.</p><br/><h1>From Earth to Terran Possession</h1><br/><p>In 2834, Dr. Vasli brought the fragment back with her to the UEA for further study. This decision was lambasted by the Terran academic community; many Terrans felt that the stone should remain where it was discovered. Upon Dr. Vasli\u2019s retirement in 2859, the UEA donated the stone to the Museum of Earth (MOE). It remained on display there for 75 years while the Terran government continually submitted requests for its repatriation.</p><br/><p>The Vasli Fragment was finally returned in 2934. To commemorate this event, the Puglisi Collection commissioned Dr. Amelia Kesh, head chair of the Prime Linguistics Institute, and master sculptor Shinji Torusa to construct an exact copy of the Fragment. Replicas were made available for public sale in 2945.</p><br/><h1>In Popular Culture</h1><br/><p>While the purpose of the Vasli Fragment is still unclear, it has been adopted by several movements in popular culture: Terran separatists use it as a symbol of their desire to break away from the United Empire of Earth, while Transitionalists tout the fragment as evidence that Humanity has many more things left to discover. Fringe groups also claim that the Vasli Fragment details the so-called Atlantean\u2019s conscious decision to leave Terra and influence the growth of all known civilizations.

Some of our animators here in Austin actually captured a lot of those emotes with motion capture. So seeing them work on those, get those in the game, to tag team with the designers and stuff. It was cool to see those in the communities hands as wellJason Hutchins: You know we've done so much in the past year, since I've been here, that it's hard to choose just one.

The 325 has a better targeting computer so it'll lock onto targets quicker for its missiles etc. The Aurora LN has better cooling, so it'll dump heat (without a sump). We definitely do this on a default component basis. That said I think the question was also about whether we have a size 1,2,3 size CPU like we do shield generators etc, and to that I say absolutely. The idea is that the larger the CPU you have the more data it handles coming through in a given time. It may be that the avionics unit itself has a certain size, so you might be able to put a new motherboard or something with more slots for things like targetting computers etc, and how many slots that takes up etc. There will be a level of customisation under the hood that you'll be able to tweak and change. It is a bit odd that larger CPUs handle larger amounts of data etc, when in modern times CPUs are getting smaller and smaller.Darian Vorlick: We ignore Moore's Law.TD: Yes!

Great show last week! With the new modular ship system coming, have the old upgrade slots been replaced by the new system? Or are they used more for system upgrades like CPU, sensors and cooling?", "answer": "Travis Day: This is actually a good thing you asked this question. There may-... it sounds like from the question there may be a little bit of a misconception about the modular system. If you remember back to say, the Cutlass and the... what did they call it? Did they call it \"Cutlass-gate\" or something like that? Anyways, the idea behind the modular system is you can already swap out coolers, avionics, motherboards, I mean that's something the system already supports. So the additional functionality of the modularity system is to swap out whole internal blocks, right - so the innards of the ship.Without saying too much about the variants for upcoming ships, what this allows you to do is, say if you have something that's a cargo bay you can... maybe on a variant it's a medical bay, or maybe on another variant... well, use the Cutlass example - maybe on another variant it's for transporting prisoners. With the modular system what it allows you to do is basically, if the ship's designed right and the internal architecture is designed right, you can remove out the cargo bay and swap it for the prisoner transport part. And then if you have larger and larger ships, like say up to an Idris, or a Javelin, or a Hull-C or something like that... or a Carrack for example had it's little modular bits... you can start removing whole rooms and replacing them with other rooms, so you can further customize the role and capability that your ship can perform. So it's not so much about items it's about whole parts of the-... not parts of the ship, but ROOMS of the ship - parts of the ships that can support, you know, multiple items inside them, or gameplay inside them. So that's the idea.Darian Vorlick: Another facet of that is, going back to the motherboard and CPU of a ship's computer, there's going to be modularity to a certain degree on those, such as a motherboard that can handle greater data throughput, or certain apps that you can get for the computer that can lock on to more targets, or has faster locking speed, or maybe have better infrared spectrum signature detection.TD: Yeah, and what he's saying is completely true, and one of the things that we actually have set up on all the ships right now are a separate targeting computer, a separate avionics computer, a separate CPU. And the CPU can best be thought of as your power plant for your ship, but for the data pipe. So the three pipes we have on the ship - it's the data pipe, which is powered by the CPU, the power pipe that's powered by the power plant, and the heat pipe which is not really powered by anything but is provided into by the weapons and anything else you have attached to the ship - engines, etc. So, yes, for example in 1.0 you'll see the Willis Ops custom targeting computer for example, allows you to dock more simultaneous targets in your... oh, Zane's going to kill me if I don't get this right... \"target overview context pane\". So, you know, decreased missile lock times... it's all these different kinds of behaviors that fall out of that system. And that's something that we have not-... we on the item manufacturing and design side, have not done a great job of showing off that system very well. You'll start to see it in 1.0, but as we start adding more and more options, and items and components, it'll become much more a part of everyday gameplay.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 02 (2014.12.29)", "source": "https://youtu.be/QiR6yJbFCfM", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Buzz Killington", "published_at_timestamp": 1419894093}, {"objectID": "373678160", "question": "Do the devs that are building the PU consult with you regarding lore routinely?

We don't want to be spinning tales and writing checks that we can't cash.DH: It's been-... We realized very early on that there was an instant connection between what we released as lore, and what you guys thought would be in the game. So we started to really tailor it to make sure that, at any given time, what we're releasing is at least inline with the spirit and the idea of what it ultimately would like to be in the game. Obviously the mechanics will shift and refine and stuff like that, but yeah, you know... the idea is that we're trying to emulate hopefully what the experience will be like.

I say if we get to $50 million, we burn the gold shirt.But in terms of the two organizations going to war and how they would fight, I would think that an organization would declare that it would be hostile to the other organization and then essentially members of the organization, if they came across each other, would try and attack each other.Usually wars tend to happen over pieces of real estate, so we are trying to add persistent aspects to the game, like we've mentioned an asteroid base you can fight over, or a space station you can fight over, and I would think that probably some of the organizational conflict will be directly related to persistent pieces of real estate in the universe, where someone's trying to fight for control of a valuable mining operation or someone's trying to fight for control of a jump point, or something like that. So that's kind of where I think the conflict would evolve around.Obviously we have some stuff that we have to do in terms of the instancing because we can't have 2,000 people all in the same area at the same time.

However is this a niche PvE mission ship, or is there something more?How will the information and data aspects affect PvP in the persistent universe?", "answer": "So we're definitely making one the items of cargo you can carry, if you've got an information runner, is encrypted information.That actually can be pretty valuable in our universe because, in our universe there is no FTL communication.Basically communication happens at the speed the ship can travel or a radio wave can travel in system. So you're sort of limited between the combination of the speed of light when you're in system, and then whatever distance you jump when an information drone goes from one jump point to another jump point.Essentially the way your communication would go across the galaxy is, say I'm on Earth, I want a message to go to Terra. I would beam the message to the closest relay station near a jump point outside of Earth, and that relay station would receive that message at the speed of light. Then it would basically encrypt the data, put it in a drone, and put it in a jump point. On the other side, there would be a relay station that would then get it, beam it to the next relay station at the next jump point, and it would do that until it got to Terra.Obviously you need to encrypt your data as you're sending it through the jump point so other people can't see it. That's where the Drake Herald comes in, because in some cases, you may not want to even be beaming your information because you're afraid someone might actually decrypt it and get the information.So it's like delivering a really valuable hand written note, but in this case it's digital. So maybe even things like deeds to areas of land, or if someone is the first person to discover an area, you have to get the digitally signed document to the records bureau on Earth, and that's something an information runner would do.That's where I would see some of the PvP and organization stuff happening because we'll definitely have some mechanics where--This is the UEE, we're going to have some bureaucracy, you're going to have to have some information and data.And that information and data you won't always want to have blasted over the air waves. So sometimes you'll hire someone to take it. Also there will be cases where there are no relay stations. There are only relay station in the well developed part of space. But in the less developed frontier worlds, there won't be. You'll definitely need a spaceship to take the information.As something like the Drake Herald, that has all the data encrypt banks that will make it much safer when you're sending it. You may not want to send that information say on a Hornet or something because it hasn't got the computer systems and the shielding to save it from someone that's a data snooper.I definitely think there will be some play mechanics for organizations so owning, having title, trade, and all that stuff that will be based on information packets that get sent.So therefore I think the PvP, as well as the PvE, will be something you can do with the Drake Herald.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 09 (2014.02.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Q4OB9Yfo-0Q", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Spaceduck", "published_at_timestamp": 1393282759}]
