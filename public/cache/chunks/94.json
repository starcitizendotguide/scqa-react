You\u2019ll have to bring \u2026 you\u2019ll have to bring food, you\u2019ll have to bring water. You\u2019ll have to bring everything you need for daily life there. It won\u2019t be \u201cOh, I just here and I\u2019ll survive forever.\u201d No. If your ship \u2026 if you crash on the planet somewhere you better have someone come and rescue you because you\u2019ll start to starve; you\u2019ll start to slowly die. - It won\u2019t be like \u201cOh, you crashed. You have no water. You\u2019re dead!\u201d No, it will take a while. We\u2019ll give you ample opportunity of finding something to eat or hunting something. Or stealing some resources from someone else. Or calling for someone to pick you up. But if you\u2019re still there after a few days - and not eating, not drinking - you\u2019re health will start to degrade to the point where \u2026<br /><br />--So the outposts will be modular I guess? Just like the \u2026 we saw recently the satellites system?--<br /><br />Yes. It\u2019s very similar. It consists of various prefabricated building you could call them. They\u2019re like \u2026 yeah, they\u2019re modules that come together. And there\u2019s modules of various sizes and how you purpose them or how \u2026 what you do with them they\u2019ll be \u201cOh, this one I\u2019ll \u2026 it\u2019s good enough for a laboratory. This one is good enough for my storage of crates. This one is good for beds and showers.\u201d So you\u2019ll be able to take one exterior and modularise it with different interiors for what you need that unit to be. And then you can connect it to another unit which does your, I don\u2019t know, harvesting of \u2026 or it\u2019s your power supply unit, and this is where you control the power for the entire settlement. Depends on how big  you want it. It could be one room or you can expand to \u2026 you\u2019ll have to bring the fences \u2026 \u2026 you\u2019ll have to make sure you can survive the weather on the planet - which will also be an element that\u2019s important. So you might have planets in which survival \u2026 just because you are there doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll survive. It might be that overnight you get -100 degrees. You\u2019ll freeze to death. Again you have to have enough power to run all the heaters to keep that base warm enough for you to survive the night. And so on.<br /><br />Might be planets that have acidic atmospheres.

[nods and makes the okay sign with both hands]FS: They're not going to be revamped. They're actually going to be new versions, and I know the Hornet specifically is very much already underway, and it looks awesome. Our ship artist, Chris Smith, over in our Austin office has been working on it. I've seen the sneak peeks and it is super cool looking.CH: It's pretty rad. [giggles]FS: It's super slick. I'm super excited, because, you know, one thing that I think that we really wanted to do or just kind of happened naturally is, you know, it's like when you have like a Mustang from 1969, it's kind of a classic. Right? Then you have like the new Mustang, right?CH: Right.FS: And I think a lot of that people would kind of think it would be cool if like you had the old Aurora, you had the old 300 or you had the old Hornet instead of trying to spruce up all the old ships constantly and continually be like we have the one Hornet and it just keeps getting better and better and better as far as the models go to keep up with all the other games.To be able to say, \"That is the Hornet from that year\" and come out with the new one later that kind of has more bells and whistles...CH: Yeah.FS: It's a little slicker or whatever, right? Would be pretty cool. Cause then you see like in the galaxy you're flying around and like, \"Oh, they're flying the new Hornet\"...CH: Yeah.FS: Or \"They're flying the more classic model.\"CH: Classic.FS: Yeah, so might be... I love... hopefully kinda works out that way. Then also the Cutlass Black is being revamped as well. The only thing that is going to be revamped on the Hornet, 300i and Aurora, the current gen, is to just make sure that they have the damage states and whatnot.

How did that develop?", "answer": "Gaige Hallman: So that's a pretty complex question but it's very related all the things we are implementing in 2.4 right now. I made a little handy list for myself. So it's starts with removing CDFs from the way we do our character loadouts and moving to a persistent system We're going to do that by basically converting everything we have in CDFs to a loadout item. Which has been developed by teams all over the U.S that we have, with code here in Austin, Texas and I believe some people in the U.K. too have all put into the system together.Transitioning into persistence which has been a big feature for 2.4 we are moving away from CDFs and into an item based loadout system, that has involved our code teams throughout all of our studios. People like Rob Ranniger, Sean Tracey of course, Paul Reindell. They've all put this together and it's been working really well lately and for the past I think month or two we've been working around the clock to get this thing working smoothly. To get this working and back onto the subject of Warhorse that was before I was here but I took a look at after reading this question and we are doing something very similar.Over the past two months I've been working on a system to have all the clothes functionally layer over each without any clipping, or any problems. And that's been quite a task because you always have issues when, a shirt as it is normally if you keep that static it can not have a jacket over it in 3D space because things will naturally clip like folds and you need to have the compression so we've been working to get different types of clothing like skin tight, loose all working together, with a series of defined volumes and that has been the main I think problem to overcome, but it's being going pretty smoothly so far and we're working out the rest of the kinks right now.Eric Kieron Davis: It's interesting the challenges that, that raises. You don't think about it if you're not a Rigger, but you also don't think about it until you get see it in game, when you get to play with it in the engine   GH: When it's in practice is when it really shows how it breaks down.EKD: Yeah, exactly and you're like \"Oh wow\". It's almost like you have to experience that to then fix it. So you can assume that this is perfect!GH: You can plan as much as you want.EKD: That's right, yeah.

We are working on it, it comes with some of the bigger ship stuff like we're doing the same stuff for the Idiris where you can fly in Gladiuses and land inside it and we're working on besides manual landing there's some auto landing modes because it's not as easy to land in a ship while it's moving as you would think and the same will be kind of for the Constellation so being able to have Merlin dock in the back and then you get in and out.So it's not going to be in the next release or two, but in the near future yes because it's on our road map and it's just a matter of getting to it and having some of the other fundamental stuff.We've been waiting till the full item system stuff is 2.0 because some of the people would be doing that are working on that and the sort of thing which we call Object Containers which is basically a holder of a whole bunch of objects and they can russian doll so you can have another holder of a whole bunch of objects inside it and object containers sit inside zones and essentially it's not a CryEngine way, it's our sort of new way of streaming in it like Port Olisar is a good example, that's a space station.That will be an object container so a point of interest will be an object container, but inside that you've got the space station and maybe room or each spoke or hub on the space station could be a separate object container so it gets russian dolled and then the Artists' are working on it so it's in a sort of modular fashion can save individual containers out and load them all in. The container itself holds the information for the objects inside it and has all the streaming information so it knows \"Oh well I'll get within this range, I need to start streaming in\" and of course containers inside something, you don't need to start streaming them in until you're going to be maybe landing on it, you can be able to walk inside.It's the sort of fundamental tech that's going to be running the Idiris and all the big ships because we've got huge floating FPS levels which you don't want to be rendering certain and you don't even want to have streamed in until you will be actually seeing them or using them or interacting with them. So that tech has to be in and then the Merlin and some other stuff happens.

Would it be dialed back or scrapped and start anew?---Hey fellas thanks for taking time to answer questions. What are some of the carrot and stick methods you utilize to get a task done on time? How do you balance positive feedback with critical critiques? What are hard lines you draw for yourself and the teams you produce?", "answer": "Darian Vorlick: So, on the first one if a component becomes too complex or cumbersome...this actually ties back to that Skype conversation I had with Steven Humphreys regarding entity token system. One of the things we talked about is anytime a designer uses the flow graph system or using flow graph as a designer, it pings the network and the more times you use flow graph to ping the network, that's going to cause more and more bandwidth problems.So, one of the things we want to do it is look at is using flow graph the most effective way of doing this design feature on the ship. So, from that it becomes a conversation between the designers, would they rather just hard code it, would they rather flow graph or entity tokens through flow graph. So, these are things that are planned out in advance but there is some research and development that goes into it, we do some concepts, some proof of concepts for prototyping to see which one works better.Eric Kieron Davis: Yeah, to speak to the next question about in terms of carrot and stick methods...I personally don't believe in carrot and stick because if you see the old adage of carrot and stick, it generally means whatever it is you're pushing for with this carrot is going to get tired at some point, right, cause they're never achieving that goal. It's more about making something attainable, more about working alongside their leads, it's more about constant and consistent daily motivation. It's not about sticking something out there and going, 'All right, let's go get it, if you don't get it you're going to get hit'.That's not going to get anything done and we work in a very creative environment, we're making video games, we're making experiences, we're making entertainment...we're not building a cog, we're not building a car, we're not building something that's been proven, we're making stuff up as we go along. It needs more, I think, finesse than carrot and stick, I think that's using very old production processes....DV: Yeah.EKD: Production facilities and it just doesn't work in this environment.DV: Yeah. I think that's largely true of a lot of game studios where production ruling with an iron fist is an antiquated model and largely doesn't work out because so many people have valuable voices to add to the content of the development of the game. It's a much more collaborative effort, there's no single moment where production is, 'this is what we need to have, this is what you're going to be working on and absolutely nothing else'. So, we have a lot of sit down discussions that we've mentioned before with our international colleagues. We also do daily stand ups with the development team to see where they are in every task, what roadblocks they have, where they're at, do we need to do anything for them to help them get their job done.EKD: To use the carrot and stick method generally means the person who's doing it, you have to force them to do something they hate.DV: Yes and we don't want to use coercion.EKD: And here everyone is excited to work on this. The passion drives all of us to work hard everyday, every second we're at our desk and if you get distracted, that happens but that generally doesn't need some forceful motivation.DV: No, no. Usually get distracted by something else cool in the game.EKD: That's right. Look what this does, isn't it cool. Then balancing positive feedback with critical critiques and hard lines, how to balance them...you want them both. You don't want everything to be negative and constantly down even though in this environment we're trying to make things better so we're always looking at things partially with a negative eye. So we need to motivate... what's good about it, what's successful, how did that go well. Let's say that last release, we all want to pick it apart and say how horrible it was, we agree with what you're saying, we read the forums and Reddit...yeah, this was horrible and that's stupid and this sucked but we have to go but we succeeded here, here and here and everybody loved it. Awesome, let's keep building on top of that while fixing the bad things. It's easier for us, we're all in that critical mind set to make things better.DV: There are sometimes where we have to put a hard line down and say, 'no, cannot include this into this build'. I know you love it and it's something that you really, really want to see fleshed out but we just don't have the resources or the time. If we can get it out for the next patch awesome but we would like to see some more testing, some more tweaking, some more balance on it and definitely some more input on whether it's from our QA team or the big man CR himself.EKD: That's right, absolutely.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 12", "source": "https://youtu.be/jx2NSZOGNqE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "The Tick & Delaron", "published_at_timestamp": 1445896605}, {"objectID": "373680870", "question": "Chris Roberts has mentioned boarding large derelict ships before.

As far as action is kind of like... you can straight out the emotional arcs, but mystery and suspense and maintaining that and knowing how much information to seed, putting just the little nuggets, it's a really fine tipping point between ruining it all too early, so everyone's like of course it was the guy with the gun  in the corner, I see him right there, or making it too obtuse, that no-one has any idea what's going on.

Also for engineers we have some basic technical tests we send out and have the applicants test to make sure we feel they're at the base standard of technical competency. Really for me, obviously if someone has worked on some interesting or complicated games in the past that's obviously is a plus but we're much more interested in end results than any degree. Like, if someone's made their own game in Unity or Unreal or CryEngine or something. If they've built their own prototype. They worked on a modding team, they worked on other teams in the industry. All those things matter much more to us than actual, whether you've got a degree in computer science or not, because you know, in making computer games there's a lot &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; you have to have a passion, you have to have a love for it.  When people put together their own demos and examples of systems they've written, it shows how they think and how they apply their engineering knowledge to achieve an objective.  That's all much more interesting.  So, you know we have Mark Abent here in the LA office who we hired, who was a relatively junior programmer, but he'd been working on mods for quite a long time and he's fantastic.  He's one of our best guys and it's because he is willing to roll up his sleeves and look into the code and figure out what's happening, and he's sort of self-starting.  So, all of those things are super important.  So, I would say if you are looking, obviously having experience in the industry helps but if you don't have any experience in the industry, then I would say doing a demo or if you worked on your own game, all of those things are actually very &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; they work well for us, that impresses us.So, there you go.

If there is no official one, do artists tend to hold onto a few of those on a personal basis?", "answer": "Forrest Stephan: We've never had a rejected concept art have we? You've never had to redo anything have you?Omar Aweidah: All the time.FS: What happens?OA: At least a few times a day.FS: You ever had to completely redo something? Where they're just no, completely rejected.OA: Yes. All the time.FS: And what do you do. Do you take any of that? Do you have a vault at your desk with a combination?OA: Okay. So, we'll break it down, cause it really depends on who's leading that concept, who's designing that... as a concept artist you're trying to develop someone else's vision. So, occasionally &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; the best way to do it is, you make a concept, you go through your first pass, they say 'Okay, this looks good, change a little bit here, change a little bit there,' everything goes smoothly, and everyone's happy, and then during your deadline, you meet your deadline, and it's cool. Sometimes, you do a concept, and maybe you get a little cheeky, you want to get creative, so you kinda throw something out from left field, and it could be like, I kinda like it, but I need you to integrate it a little more, or it can be the worst which is... this is not what I'm thinking at all, redo it.So, those concepts usually aren't put into a vault. Some things that are put into a vault, and I can speak on this for like assets, helmets and things like that is, lets say I create something and it's a little bit weird, it's a little bit too sci-fi, they want something more industrial and not as sleek, you might take that concept and say, hey, it kinda looks like it fits over here more, so when we get to this, when we have to do this task, then here's something that we kinda like the feel, then you might be able to start with, or something you might be able to fit Kruger and RSI and then you'd be like, okay well that's more RSI, lets just put it and hold it.FS: Yeah, I don't think in general we ever have to keep it in a vault as much as really look at the concept and figure out, okay, where does this actually fit in the world. Obviously it's not always going to be perfect the first time around, but now that we actually have these manufacturers, and we've finally been able to put Chris Roberts' kind of visual standards onto the screen, we have a better and better idea of what each concept gears towards as far as the manufacturers, so you know, and the styles, and the look of the game, so it's...I don't say we ever really throw anything away, I feel like for every concept piece, even if it's not 100% correct, there's elements that we can take for it, even if you needed to take that element and put it towards another concept for another manufacturer.OA: And even if it's like geometry-based, you can always go in and just rip one thing like, I really like the thruster, but the whole rest of the ship is awful, and you just rip it out. But with ships though, I think with assets it's easier, but with ships they're really deliberate from the get-go, so very rarely when we start a ship do we finish and say oh, it doesn't match, we'll throw it away. That ship is designed to fit a certain thing, and there're so many stages that it really can't get off-track so much to the point where there's a finished product that people aren't happy with.FS: Yeah that's exactly... it wouldn't be rejecting concepts for ships, it's evolving the concept for ships.OA: That's nice...FS: Not bad huh? So you know, you've got Chris Roberts, you've got designers, you have concept artists, you have a slew of people that're reviewing these concept arts, and from the very get-go we're making sure that it works in every aspect that's required for the game and meeting the visual consistencies that we need for the universe so, it just keeps evolving until finally it's something that we're ready to... we feel like it's something for Star Citizen.Alright, hope that answers your question Swordfish...

(public, as in sold/given to an official UEE information bureau)", "answer": "Cherie Heiberg: Well, what I want, and what hasn't been implemented yet, which i'm going to emphasize, is that the game will have a behind-the-scenes mechanism way of recording discoveries. This won't lead to immediate publication on the galactapedia of course, this'll just be behind the scenes, so that we know who discovered it, who's been to the location, etc... etc... etc..., so we have these internal numbers to compare to when you as the player report the discovery. The second part of this question is that, when you make new discoveries like this, and items of interest pop up, is that you the player should have the choice whether or not to report it. I want this because what if you are coming back to pirates, what if you're playing as a pirate, and you discover a jump point no-one else has discovered it yet. How strategically valuable would it be to keep that jump point for yourself, and to fight people off to make sure that no-one can discover this jump point but you? And if we have it so that it automatically publishes in the galactapedia that you've discovered this jump point, well there's no secrecy anymore, so why bother to defend the point, why do anything, so I feel that makes sense.Adam Wieser: A very interesting kind of strategic ability, whether you're a corporation trying to get a better trading route, and there are plenty of jump points out there that will be up for grabs, and may be beneficial to players out there, so...CH: So yes. The short answer to the question is that, if you make a new discovery, you will need to report it in order for it to be recorded in the galactapedia, for you to get the recognition. You also asked a little bit about certain triggers happening in the game, NPC's revealing things, and that information would be published. If an NPC discovers something. Just... in game planned events. This is all my personal vision, this is what I want to happen, and I think that this is the best route for the players and the characters they want to be.", "title": "10 for the Writers: Episode 04 (2015.07.06)", "source": "https://youtu.be/l20qVwjFjUE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "SwordfishLspear", "published_at_timestamp": 1436220050}, {"objectID": "f646a353c24fb_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Turret-controls - If all the weapons are slaved to the pilot, you really lose out on the massive coverage arcs the wing-tip Omni-Orb turret offers the ship.

Obviously you won't be able to do the co-op or multiplayer segments there, but we've said that. As far as hosting your own offline servers that's definitely still going to happen, just not to the same level of fidelity as our own servers, given that we have hundreds and hundreds or even thousands of servers spinning up dynamically to handle things like the economy simulation, different player instances, matchmaking stuff, PU databases etc etc as well. The offline or Private servers will be more like the freelancer servers are now, where you have a server that can handle a fixed number of players, and all you and your friends can run around together. No one will be able to run a moddable server with say a million players it's just impossible, you'd need a server base at the same scale as we'll have. But you'll certainly have these smaller servers available for you and your friends if you don't want to play in our PU. These smaller servers won't be updated as quickly as our PU, like we'll drop content and other game-master events in ours first as it's the priority and it would be an extra level of work bring it down to work on smaller level servers. So we're still going to deliver on all of our promises with that caveat which I've said from the beginning, the PU is just going to be able to support more players and be far more dynamic in a way that the moddable private servers won't be. I kind of understand why the Elite: Dangerous guys made that choice, because their game does revolve around some of that dynamic stuff that they provide, just like our PU will, but we're still allowing single player in the form of SQ42 and you'll still be able to run your own scaled down private servers.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 47 (2014.12.01)", "source": "https://youtu.be/E8Euwh_fPeg", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Icinix", "published_at_timestamp": 1417474885}, {"objectID": "373678530", "question": "In the PU will it be possible to remain anonymous? Think of \"The Transporter\" - going into a bar, meet the customer, getting paid in cash and then doing a job for him without knowing who I am.", "answer": "I think we'll definitely have the ability for you to take some anonymous style work in the universe, we've already talked about thinks like all ships having an ID number, but maybe you could jam that and hide it from scanners so it wouldn't be necessarily visible to others depending on your and their equipment. There will definitely be the option to take slightly \"grey\" missions, but it's still early days in figuring out mission mechanics, it's definitely something that we'll be folding into it, but I don't have a great answer for this right now, this IS the kind of nuance that we'll be looking into once the base mission system is laid out however.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 40 (2014.10.06)", "source": "https://youtu.be/pBWJYb2Wtg0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Scrymgeour", "published_at_timestamp": 1412632803}, {"objectID": "373679340", "question": "During Around the Verse episode 8, we were shown several different potential color schemes for the exterior of the M50. How much control will we have over the look of our ships once the PU launches? Will it be a selection of colors like this or will we be able to more fully change the colors of ships (like custom car painting)? What impact will the skins available for pledging now have, and will they work on all ships equally?", "answer": "Hmmm, this question sounds very much like the question from HeadlessChook. But, so, the M50 is going to be right now in the one scheme. Long-term, as I said, we were working on a customization setup so players can determine... you know, can set up specific colors for their ship, put names on their ships, and stuff like that. So we're still in the tech R&D phase for that. We'd like to make it fairly flexible so you can do some more sort of custom stuff, but in the very least you should be able to change out the primary or secondary color. And when that becomes online we'll definitely allow the player to, for something like the M50, you'll be able to buy it in a few different liveries. And then again, the skins that are available for pledging now, essentially how flexible the tech is will dictate how many ships those skins will be available on. If the tech isn't so flexible then it'll be on a lesser amount of them... if it's pretty flexible then we'd make it available to pretty much most of them - that make sense anyway! I mean I doubt the paint job that goes on a small fighter would be applicable for a paint job, say on a Bengal carrier or something.

Maybe two teams, red and blue would be sort of the standard teams, but we think we may switch that up to be even more fun than re vs blue.Then maybe later on we'll do some scenarios, but the idea of the dogfighting test isn't really to deliver a fully fledged game like you would normally expect, this is really for us to test the back end of infrastructure for multiplayer, the balance of the ships, seeing if the flight model and everything is fun, so it will be an iterative process.The early parts of any of the modules are obviously a lot rougher than the final, polished versions, but it's all in the effort of making the game as good as possible.So I guess bear with us on that.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 01 (2013.12.06)", "source": "https://youtu.be/QACEabB_8lA", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Whiplash", "published_at_timestamp": 1391813631}, {"objectID": "12641961", "question": "It has been revealed that Citizens will enjoy benefits like reduced tax and have easier access to inter species trade. You stated before that there would be a self-sustained economy. How will this actually work in the game?", "answer": "Chris Roberts: The model\u2019s really similar to the system we have in today\u2019s world. For instance, there will be different taxes on those coming into a country as compared to those who already live there. So the idea of citizenship isn\u2019t about greatly reducing taxes. You\u2019re a citizen and have rights that are different than people who aren\u2019t citizens. Perhaps you could have different licenses for trading and you could also have a better chance of being protected if you\u2019re a citizen. So it\u2019s sort of taking modern day practices with nations and extrapolating them into the future. Some people may not want to be a citizen. If you want to operate on the other side of the law, you probably don\u2019t want to be a citizen.", "title": "Star Citizen Interview: Chris Roberts On Building A Space Simulator For The Ages", "source": "https://gamingbolt.com/star-citizen-interview-chris-roberts-on-building-a-space-simulator-for-the-ages", "type": "article", "user": "Ravi Sinha", "published_at_timestamp": 1391558400}]
