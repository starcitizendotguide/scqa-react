Cause like, I remember when I was a designer working for the studios and when we... before we released any betas or alphas or anything like we were able to just work on our feature and really nail that feature down. We also had... you know QA didn't really bug it up, because they knew it was being worked on. Where now in open development we're always live and people get to see everything we do every single push...Mark Abent: Oh yeah. [nods]RV: And the features we push forward. The QAs ... again QA is awesome, because they're basically our last line of defense as well as they're on all the bugs on live, they're on the bugs on the features, so they're bugging everything.MA: And they even talk with the community to find what they have ...RV:  Basically.MA: And going back and forward...RV: Yeah.MA: Gather all the information and drop it on our desk. Okay. [laughs]RV: Yeah, so it's like it's,I think open development to me takes a little bit longer. I think that's the con, but again we get really valuable feedback really early on. I know port modification and the 2.4 stuff we've been working with the private group. We've been getting a lot of feedback on some of the features that we're trying to push out and stuff we didn't even think about we're like, \"Oh yeah.\"MA: Yeah.RV: Okay, cool. We didn't catch that. Cause, I mean QA we have like maybe 30 people if that. I don't even know the actual number.MA: I think there is more, cause UK and Austin have a lot.RV: Yeah, but it's like I don't know. Like, I think it might be about like 30 something people and that's not enough people like all the stuff we need from there. We need more. We need more people test.MA: Need big development access.RV: So that's good. That's definitely a good pro for having open development in that where in closed development we don't have those same numbers of people being able to jump in and play test. Sometimes getting everyone involved is kind of crazy, especially in trying to get devs to take time out of the day to playtest. Which we do, from...MA: Well, that's why you go around going, [pokes Randy in his shoulder repetitively] \"Ready to playtest?\"RV: Yeah.MA: \"Ready to playtest? Ready to playtest?\"RV: Yeah, little bit.MA: \"5 minutes. 5 minutes\" [holds up 5 fingers repetitively][Both Laugh]RV: So yeah, that's kind of problem I have for like open development versus closed development. I don't have a preference. Sometimes I have, like if I'm working on a feature, I have a preference, but if I'm not working on a feature and I'm just like helping support stuff then I definitely prefer one to the other.MA: Yeah.RV: Anything on you?MA: Nah, I'm good.", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 11", "source": "https://youtu.be/Qhx_0AIniws", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Ripking", "time": "7m21s", "published_at_timestamp": 1464039966}, {"objectID": "17a4b37bb39755_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "No, it will have a bed similar to the one found in the Starfarer.", "published_at_timestamp": 1461880800, "question": "Does the bed function as an escape pod?", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/15319-Q-A-MISC-Prospector-Part-II", "title": "Q&A: MISC Prospector - Part II", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "373674720", "question": "When activating a distress beacon, for whatever reason, is there a chance the Banu or Xi'an will come to your rescue?

It also potentially could be used by less than scrupulous people that may want to, I don't know, do something nefarious if you're especially in unprotected areas. Or potentially someone like the Vanduul, if they're around, or maybe they're listening for beacons and they would come over to see where the beacon is if they are being especially dastardly, which occasionally the Vanduul can be.But it's still something that we're going to flesh out. It's one of the features that we're going to be putting in proper distress beacons system for the future, not the next revision, the next 2.4 which is the next one we'll have out, but not very long after that we will actually have the distress beacon which is a fun ... it's not just going to be about the beacon it will be about you'll be able to give your position to friends or other people that you're flying with so you can coordinate meeting each other or if you are stranded in space someone coming to rescue you. So that's actually part of the system that we have scheduled to be fleshing out to allow you to meet up or find people in the middle of space, which is obviously very big.So there you go.

But if we do do this though, like it's certainly something we're looking into, but if we did it, one of things it would do is we have a concept of the armor, the armor itself has health in addition to your hull having health so as you hit something, if you got just a glancing blow, it would degrade the armor and wear away at that so future impacts would still have more of an effect so you would never have a projectile have zero effect on the world around you. It will always leave some impact either on the health of the shields, the health of the armor, or the health of the hull.

So, I am pretty convinced that we will have artists building art even for procedurally generated planets.LP: Yes.So, the methodologies that we're using right now are split between 90/10 and then 10/90 and that means that the majority of the encounters that you'll have on an auto-generated planet will be auto-generated encounters.

It's not necessarily hardcore permadeath, but it's pretty hardcore compared to other games, with our limited number of respawns before everything gets passed onto your next of kin for example.

Here we see a pilot taking on a Vanduul Scythe, and when she blows them up she comes and lands in the hangar, takes off her helmet, and you realize it's a woman piloting it the entire time - showing that she's pretty kick-ass. So I think that right there's a good indicator of he we want to keep things... I guess... I don't wanna say \"gender equal\" - that sounds so politically correct!Travis Day: Well no, but I mean almost just like reflective of the real world, 'cause that's immersive right? Women are lawyers, they're doctors... I mean, it sounds weird when I say it, but it's like, it would seem odd if you have a bunch of women running around scantily clad or... you know, some games it kinda breaks the immersion when you're like, \"that doesn't make any sense, that doesn't look right,\" so...DV: I'd rather see a bunch of kick-butt warrior women.Alex Mayberry: I think realistic is what we're shooting for, right?TD & DV: Yes.AM: We don't want our females to be portrayed as fantasy avatars. They should be an extension of who you're playing and they should look like they belong to the world.DV: I figure, how many hundreds of years in the future? I think difference between- or any perceived difference - imagined or real - would be negligible at that point.AM: Yeah. So, yeah, we're trying to keep it real. In fact, we are right now finalizing our female base-model that we're going to build upon, and players will have the option to pick their wardrobe, and swap costumes out, and environment suits and all that. So a lot of the way that the female will be portrayed will be up to the people playing the game.TD: Yeah. And realistic because it's a scan - not just an artists interpretation of the female body, I guess.AM: Exactly.TD: Keepin' it real.AM: Keepin' it real.DV: Yeeeah.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 03 (2015.01.12)", "source": "https://youtu.be/EcnGeEBt3Go", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Zapa", "published_at_timestamp": 1421103656}, {"objectID": "373683630", "question": "Will the Origin 890 JUMP, RSI Orion, Aegis Surveyor, Anvil Carrack, MISC Hull C (Discreet), and the Drake Herald become available as single-ship pledge packages before release?", "answer": "That's a good question.Again we haven't fully decided what we're gonna do there, but I'm willing to say that quite a few of those probably will be available before the game comes out.Definitely the 890 JUMP. Then the other ones, the ones that all you guys voted for, probably. They really just have to be in the pipeline. So we're just getting going on designing on the concept stage, then obviously on the model. But we still haven't hit the concept stage on a lot of these ones because we've got a huge back-log of ships to do, I think it's over 50 different ships that we have to do at the moment.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 28.

So if they fight a lot of battles and they manage to be on the winning end of them, then they will actually get better.The cost of hiring the crew will be dependent on their skill level. You could go for a cheaper crew, but they may not be as good as a veteran or elite crew. So on that level the NPCs will have some of the typical RPG progression, but obviously as a player, you yourself don't.I guess the question is, if he does sit in the gunner seat for a while, and manages to hit a few things, and you do alright, then he will slowly get better at it.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 12 (2014.03.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/-3KIcnKf3O0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Stoj", "published_at_timestamp": 1395093621}, {"objectID": "373686060", "question": "How is the 'one server' setup going to work with servers being hosted in various parts of the globe? If I'm in a guild with someone from say, Australia, how wouldwe get grouped together if I'm playing on a US server and they're playing on the Australian hosted one?", "answer": "The thing to remember in our server set up is that we have one central server that is basically the general tasking server, but the actual servers that would handle the local instance information when you're flying in space dogfighting against someone or figuring out when you're on a planet what the other people are doing right next to you, they're actually going to be mostly distributed around the world. So that's where the local instance servers spin up, and what happens is the master server is really the match making server. It's sort of going \"Ok you and you, I'm putting you together in the same instance server,\" and it has a whole set of criteria when it does that matchmaking. So a large part of it is the friends list so it will try to match you with your friends, and also it will do things like, we'll try and have, if you want to do PvP put maybe some of your enemies in there and people of similar skill levels. This is by the way just to stress in the case that you're in an area that there are more people than can fit in any one instance. If there's enough people just for one instance, everyone will be in the same instance. With a few exceptions. Like if someone is in a safe area and they don't want PvP, and someone just wants PvP, then maybe there would be two instances, one for the PvP, one without the PvP. But generally what happens is, there's a whole sort of matchmaking criteria and it's based on ping, friends list, associates, persons of interest, enemies, skill level, and it uses that criteria to match you up dynamically as you move around. As you fly around space, you go from area to area, it's matching you up and putting you in different instances and it's doing exactly the same down on the planet. So what would happen if someone is in America and Australia is, depending on what you tell the game, it probably would not opt to put you together if the ping was high, but you certainly could say \"Hey you know what, I want to hang out with my friends no matter what, even if my pin is bad,\" and in that case the friend relationship would trump the ping in terms of the matchmaking criteria. So generally we would default to trying to keep you flying with people at low pings, but if you specifically say \"I want to be with this person\" we'll make an exception for you.
