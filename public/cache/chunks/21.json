[{"objectID": "box5moyeoZ-fall-of-virgil", "answer": "The Fall of Virgil refers to the 2 January 2737 SEY invasion of the Virgil system by the Vanduul directly after the conclusion of the Siege of Tiber. United Empire of Earth (UEE) forces, depleted after four years of battle, were unable to mount a suitable defense against the invading Vanduul, who pursued them once Tiber fell. Although the system was lost, the UEE Navy was able to cover the retreat of over one million refugees. </p><br/><h1>BUILDUP</h1><br/><p>Before 2681 and the events of Vanduul-Human First Contact, the Virgil system was on an upward trajectory. As the launchpoint of Project Far Star, it was both a hub for explorers and a symbol of the UEE's continual outward expansion. Cyrene (Virgil I) was growing to be an economic powerhouse, having both a thriving resort industry due to its beautiful, lush landscapes and a robust agricultural system fed by highly fertile soil. However, when the Vanduul began launching regular raids in Virgil, the system's growth slowed. Project Far Star and talks of Senatorial recognition for Cyrene were put on hold pending resolution of the worsening Vanduul-Human conflict. </p><br/><p>After the Orion system fell to the Vanduul in 2712, the military forces stationed there retreated into the Tiber system, where they set up a line of defense in anticipation of a forthcoming assault. With the mounting threat to its neighboring systems, Virgil's already faltering tourism industry collapsed, and the system was soon transformed into a military outpost.</p><br/><p>At the start of the Siege of Tiber in 2732, the population of Cyrene dropped to a few million people as all those with the means to do so fled. Countless others who did not have the resources to escape on their own applied to the government to help them relocate, but the Imperator Galor Messer IX refused to grant any aid, stating that Cyrene could not afford to lose more workers. Many turned to smugglers to help them flee, but some remained behind, believing that the might of the UEE would eventually prevail. Their faith appeared on the verge of paying off in November 2736, when the UEE conducted a bombing run on Tiber II and destroyed all Vanduul encampments there, enabling them to retake the planet, the Tiber belt alpha, and the Vector-Tiber jump point. Two UEE Navy Battle Groups departed the system for repairs, and two more remained to pick off the few remaining Vanduul. It seemed that the UEE was on the verge of victory. </p><br/><p>On 29 December 2736, the tide abruptly turned. A Kingship accompanied by an enormous Vanduul Clan entered Tiber through the Orion-Tiber jump point and opened fire on the 81st Battle Group. Within half a day, three quarters of their ships were destroyed. Admiral Mira Triolo ordered them to retreat into Virgil while she remained behind with the 6th Battle Group to hold the line. </p><br/><h1>THE INVASION</h1><br/><p>When the remains of the 81st entered Virgil it set off a panic. Millions of people who remained in the system clamored to be evacuated ahead of a potential Vanduul invasion. Citing the actions of the Vanduul in the aftermath of the Battle of Orion, the Governors Council of Cyrene issued a statement assuring the public that a secondary invasion was unlikely to occur, and that they had sent a message to the Imperator requesting immediate military assistance. This helped calm things enough to avoid the threat of riots while the Council, with the help of the 81st, was able to organize an evacuation effort that succeeded in transporting over one million evacuees through the Vega and Oberon jump points over three standard days.</p><br/><p>On 2 January 2737 the 6th Battle Group in Tiber fell. Within hours, the Kingship and its accompanying Clan entered the Virgil system headed straight for Cyrene, making landfall at the city of Kastak and launching an all-out assault on the planet. The remnants of the 81st could offer little resistance, but elected to do all they could to hold off the Vanduul while the last transports fled the system under the protection of Squadron 214. When the final transport made it through the Vega jump point, Squadron 214 turned back to attempt to rescue more people. They were able to complete two more runs before they were unable to continue.</p><br/><p>The Vanduul continued their assault against Cyrene and the rest of the system unabated until no other life remained. The surface of Cyrene was reduced to nothing, casting a cloud of radioactive ash into the atmosphere that created nuclear winter. Hundreds of thousands of Humans and Tevarin that were unable to escape perished. Those who had not died during the initial Vanduul onslaught soon starved or succumbed to radiation poisoning. </p><br/><h1>AFTERMATH, ANALYSIS, AND IMPACT</h1><br/><p>The military aid that the Governors Council of Cyrene had requested did not arrive until well over a week later. By that point, the Virgil system was completely overrun. Instead of entering the system and ousting the Vanduul, the military created a defensive line around the jump point to Virgil in anticipation of another assault. As with the loss of the Orion system, the attack did not immediately occur, and the Vanduul began to harvest Virgil's resources. Multiple scouting missions came back with reports that Cyrene was irrecoverable. In 2743, the UEE announced that they would not retake the system.</p><br/><p>Suddenly finding themselves on the front line, residents of the neighboring Vega system took what happened in Virgil as a cautionary tale and began to flee in droves, severely impacting the system's economy. Evacuees from Virgil, most of whom had little in their possession but their clothing, suffered food shortages as they awaited resettlement. Some were able to relocate to other systems, but the majority stayed near the military bases on Aremis (Vega II) and took any jobs that they could. Historians believe that this may have prevented the system's economy from entering a true depression, though it did not avert a recession. Today, over a quarter of people born in the Vega system can trace their lineage back to former residents of Cyrene. </p><br/><p>The destruction of the Virgil system deeply affected the UEE. While Orion's loss had been significant, it was a young colony and had not undergone significant development, and Tiber was a sparsely-populated mining system with only small settlements. Virgil had over 300 years of history and was a major system with a world on the verge of recognition. As the heart of Project Far Star, it was also a symbol of the UEE's continual expansion. The UEE Navy's defeat at Tiber and subsequent failure to protect Virgil shook the people's confidence in the military and in the UEE at large. Historians cite the Fall of Virgil one of the many motivating factors that eventually led to the anti-Messer revolution in 2792.

So, we should talk about this for a little bit in that, there's a big difference in the team set up when you're live and basically open development compared to when you're behind closed doors and the players don't get a chance to see what you're actually working on. Cause like, I remember when I was a designer working for the studios and when we... before we released any betas or alphas or anything like we were able to just work on our feature and really nail that feature down. We also had... you know QA didn't really bug it up, because they knew it was being worked on. Where now in open development we're always live and people get to see everything we do every single push...Mark Abent: Oh yeah. [nods]RV: And the features we push forward. The QAs ... again QA is awesome, because they're basically our last line of defense as well as they're on all the bugs on live, they're on the bugs on the features, so they're bugging everything.MA: And they even talk with the community to find what they have ...RV:  Basically.MA: And going back and forward...RV: Yeah.MA: Gather all the information and drop it on our desk. Okay. [laughs]RV: Yeah, so it's like it's,I think open development to me takes a little bit longer. I think that's the con, but again we get really valuable feedback really early on. I know port modification and the 2.4 stuff we've been working with the private group. We've been getting a lot of feedback on some of the features that we're trying to push out and stuff we didn't even think about we're like, \"Oh yeah.\"MA: Yeah.RV: Okay, cool. We didn't catch that. Cause, I mean QA we have like maybe 30 people if that. I don't even know the actual number.MA: I think there is more, cause UK and Austin have a lot.RV: Yeah, but it's like I don't know. Like, I think it might be about like 30 something people and that's not enough people like all the stuff we need from there. We need more. We need more people test.MA: Need big development access.RV: So that's good. That's definitely a good pro for having open development in that where in closed development we don't have those same numbers of people being able to jump in and play test. Sometimes getting everyone involved is kind of crazy, especially in trying to get devs to take time out of the day to playtest.

Sometimes I have, like if I'm working on a feature, I have a preference, but if I'm not working on a feature and I'm just like helping support stuff then I definitely prefer one to the other.MA: Yeah.RV: Anything on you?MA: Nah, I'm good.", "published_at": "2016-05-23", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 11", "source": "https://youtu.be/Qhx_0AIniws", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Ripking", "time": "7m21s", "published_at_timestamp": 1464039966}, {"objectID": "17a4b37bb39755_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "No, it will have a bed similar to the one found in the Starfarer.", "published_at": "2016-04-29", "published_at_timestamp": 1461880800, "question": "Does the bed function as an escape pod?", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/15319-Q-A-MISC-Prospector-Part-II", "title": "Q&A: MISC Prospector - Part II", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "373674720", "question": "When activating a distress beacon, for whatever reason, is there a chance the Banu or Xi'an will come to your rescue?

It also potentially could be used by less than scrupulous people that may want to, I don't know, do something nefarious if you're especially in unprotected areas. Or potentially someone like the Vanduul, if they're around, or maybe they're listening for beacons and they would come over to see where the beacon is if they are being especially dastardly, which occasionally the Vanduul can be.But it's still something that we're going to flesh out. It's one of the features that we're going to be putting in proper distress beacons system for the future, not the next revision, the next 2.4 which is the next one we'll have out, but not very long after that we will actually have the distress beacon which is a fun ... it's not just going to be about the beacon it will be about you'll be able to give your position to friends or other people that you're flying with so you can coordinate meeting each other or if you are stranded in space someone coming to rescue you. So that's actually part of the system that we have scheduled to be fleshing out to allow you to meet up or find people in the middle of space, which is obviously very big.So there you go.

But if we do do this though, like it's certainly something we're looking into, but if we did it, one of things it would do is we have a concept of the armor, the armor itself has health in addition to your hull having health so as you hit something, if you got just a glancing blow, it would degrade the armor and wear away at that so future impacts would still have more of an effect so you would never have a projectile have zero effect on the world around you. It will always leave some impact either on the health of the shields, the health of the armor, or the health of the hull.

We will still have to create art of that as well, even if it's procedurally generated. So... the answer is yes. We will be building art for all locations.Lance Powell: Are you sure about that? Is that your final answer?EB: I don't know how else we would see art... even if the programming... it's just not the way our game is built. So, I am pretty convinced that we will have artists building art even for procedurally generated planets.LP: Yes.So, the methodologies that we're using right now are split between 90/10 and then 10/90 and that means that the majority of the encounters that you'll have on an auto-generated planet will be auto-generated encounters. Versus the other side... you go to a planet like Terra and the experience is going to be very well crafted. So, it depends on which planet you go to... which system you're spending your time around and so on.Something that was also brought up in the question which is really interesting... the breathing apparatus, how is your ship impacted by planets with higher gravity... those conversations have been discussed and they're in the works. The details are to be determined.EB: I mean, one easy way that we could... for the examples you mentioned, how ships might be affected by different atmospheres and temperatures and things like that... because of the way we're building our damage system, we may be able to leverage that in order to apply effects to the ship based on the experience that the ship is getting. Right, so if you go through an especially hot environment and that's peeling off your paint or whatnot.

If I'm in a guild with someone from say, Australia, how wouldwe get grouped together if I'm playing on a US server and they're playing on the Australian hosted one?", "answer": "The thing to remember in our server set up is that we have one central server that is basically the general tasking server, but the actual servers that would handle the local instance information when you're flying in space dogfighting against someone or figuring out when you're on a planet what the other people are doing right next to you, they're actually going to be mostly distributed around the world. So that's where the local instance servers spin up, and what happens is the master server is really the match making server. It's sort of going \"Ok you and you, I'm putting you together in the same instance server,\" and it has a whole set of criteria when it does that matchmaking. So a large part of it is the friends list so it will try to match you with your friends, and also it will do things like, we'll try and have, if you want to do PvP put maybe some of your enemies in there and people of similar skill levels. This is by the way just to stress in the case that you're in an area that there are more people than can fit in any one instance. If there's enough people just for one instance, everyone will be in the same instance. With a few exceptions. Like if someone is in a safe area and they don't want PvP, and someone just wants PvP, then maybe there would be two instances, one for the PvP, one without the PvP. But generally what happens is, there's a whole sort of matchmaking criteria and it's based on ping, friends list, associates, persons of interest, enemies, skill level, and it uses that criteria to match you up dynamically as you move around. As you fly around space, you go from area to area, it's matching you up and putting you in different instances and it's doing exactly the same down on the planet. So what would happen if someone is in America and Australia is, depending on what you tell the game, it probably would not opt to put you together if the ping was high, but you certainly could say \"Hey you know what, I want to hang out with my friends no matter what, even if my pin is bad,\" and in that case the friend relationship would trump the ping in terms of the matchmaking criteria. So generally we would default to trying to keep you flying with people at low pings, but if you specifically say \"I want to be with this person\" we'll make an exception for you.
