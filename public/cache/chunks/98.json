Many centennial blooms are tended on R.aip'u\u0101ng (Kai'pua II), the center of Li\u2019tova in the Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an). Like the centennial bloom's reproduction cycle, R.aip'u\u0101ng's rotation period completes once every 100 MXY.</p><br/><h1>Description and Lifecycle</h1><br/><p>Standing half a meter tall at its highest, the centennial bloom is a small tree that varies in coloration depending on its particular cultivar. The most common variety has a sturdy, woody trunk with dark-brown and light-brown horizontal banding and dark-green elliptic leaves. Its light-pink flowers are bilaterally symmetrical and have stamens about twice as long as the flower itself. During the short time it blooms, it gives off an earthy scent. Flies and other carrion-eating bugs are its main pollinators on its world of origin, Ko\u2019li. The flower blooms for around 40 hours before it starts to wither, putting all its energy into reproduction.</p><br/><p>The centennial bloom grows a small, dark-purple berry that\u2019s eaten by local wildlife and propagated in the surrounding areas. Its native desert climate dries out the seeds in preparation for the rainy season. It takes a seed one full Xi\u2019an year to sprout. During that year, it must only be watered sporadically and must never be allowed to remain wet for more than 20 hours or the seed is in danger of rotting. Centennial blooms on R.aip\u2019u\u0101ng grown in more temperate areas are kept dry through constant, careful attention and specialized equipment that mimics the day/night cycle on Ko\u2019li. Lovers of the centennial bloom often keep theirs in a sealed arcology that automatically regulates the environment to suit the plant\u2019s needs. Over the past decade, it has increased in popularity as a shipboard plant</p><br/><h1>Importance to Li'tova</h1><br/><p>Li\u2019tova is a spiritual practice centered around the understanding of time. One of the main facets scholars contemplate is the way actions ripple backwards and forwards across time. Acknowledging the seen and unseen ramifications of one\u2019s deeds is one of the core principles in the Li\u2019tova code of ethics. Other aspects include the exploration of time as a dimension, the perception of time on an individual level through metabolic manipulation under meditation, and the measurement of time on a collective level. The centennial bloom\u2019s 100-year flowering cycle appeared to the explorers who discovered it on Ko\u2019li to be a poetic manifestation of Li\u2019tova itself. The plant was extracted from Ko\u2019li en masse before its terraforming and exported to R.aip\u2019u\u0101ng to be raised and contemplated.</p><br/><h1>End of the Cold War</h1><br/><p>At the end of the Xi\u2019an-Human Cold War in 2793 (III.1053), Emperor Kr.\u0113 invited the new ImperatorErin Toi for a tour of R.aip\u2019u\u0101ng. Though the existence of the jump point was public knowledge, Humans had long been barred from entering the \u0112\u2019aluth system. The Emperor personally clipped a branch from a centennial bloom and handed it to Toi.

One hurdle that the Art Vehicle Team has is that there are debris entities created when a ship is destroyed, and right now when that happens they take the item, move it over, and then it's magically moved - it doesn't have any pipe connections or persistent info, so it'll just spawn, vanish, and that's it. They need a more robust system to keep them there, to extract items, and then maybe also the resources on those debris pieces. Otherwise, if you blow up a ship and look inside it looks like an empty husk, and maybe a seat is floating. Ships spawn with Object Containers inside of the ship, and they want those to remain when a ship turns into a debris piece, but there are some tech limits on why they don't. So if you were to put a Big Benny's inside a Cutlass and it then explodes, you'd want them, or any other items that were inside, to still be there. As such, they have to solve how they're going to keep those, and transfer those Object Containers and what's inside them to the debris pieces, so that whatever mechanic is used, Players could extract those things outside of the debris piece or turn chunks into some sort of commodity. Mark Abent has seen prototypes of the mining laser being used to extract salvage, but that's just a \"what if we did this\" situation and not final. Really, it's unclear what Salvage will look like and what hurdles there will definitely be. Even if Salvage ends up being \"mining ships\" at the least that will be the first iteration for Players to try out, before the Devs get something more complicated out.", "published_at_timestamp": 1558137330}, {"objectID": "947638900", "title": "Calling All Devs - Calling All Papys, Part II", "question": "What is the deal with the Hull C?", "published_at": "2018-07-23", "source": "https://youtu.be/DQA1-nT6ev4", "type": "youtube", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "time": "0m51s", "answer": "", "published_at_timestamp": 1532372924}, {"objectID": "56b345de08054_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The 12 SCU cargo space is the cargo grid for both cubes and scavenged items which you wish to legitimately store.

When I leave my moving ship I instantly stop relative to the ship. Following Newton's First Law of Motion I should remain at the same speed as my ship, and be able to do an EVA regardless of velocity i.e. 2001 a Space Odyssey. Will this ever be an option in the game?", "answer": "This is something we've debated internally. The conflict with it is, we want to cap your individual player velocity so it doesn't become too big to control or arrest. For instance your EVA pack doesn't have nearly the amount of fuel or thrust power that say, for instance, your spaceship would necessarily have. Although the other flip side of that, is that you should inherit the velocity of your parent object. So if you step off a Freelancer that's going 200 m/s, I should probably be flying 200 m/s, or moving at 200 m/s.We sort of go back and forth on our debate on this because essentially what happens is the EVA system has several thresholds. One, it has a normal one which is 15 m/s, and then it has the \"boost\" one, which is 50 m/s maybe 100 m/s, I honestly can't remember what that is. Those are the ranges that it caps you in, in the same way that ships themselves are capped.Don't forget that there is only a certain amount of thrust on your EVA pack. So there's a certain point where, just for instance if you were like designing it so people couldn't get themselves in trouble, you probably would cap how fast you would let them accelerate to because they would need to have enough thrust available for them to decelerate back down to zero; or else you would get up to a certain speed and you would never be able to stop unless someone else stopped you. As an individual in an EVA suit, getting stopped when you're at a fast speed would either be very painful, fatal, or would take someone a lot of care to do. That's kind of it. We sort of have the trade off. I would think that what we would probably do, is if you went out EVAing at speed, you would go out at speed and it would bleed your speed down to a more controllable amount, but you should inherit the velocity of your parent ship. I don't know whether we'd let you open the airlock doors and get out when you're in cruise or anything really fast.

It's sort of two layer system where your ship or your component is going to have so much durability to it and that's like its maximum health pool and then you'll have its current repair state which is its current health and so you'll be able to repair a destroyed ship or a broken component up to that maximum durability point and that will be a quicker action... so a few minutes, maybe a little bit longer if it's a really big capital ship or like a Hull series.  But when you want to raise that durability back up and raise its max potential, that's going to be more taking it to a refurbishing shop and you will have to drop the component off for a little bit of time where it may be a day, a couple hours.  It will really vary based on the size and the damage.  But then that shop is going to bring your durability back up to full and give it back to you in a lot better condition than when you dropped it off.Calix Reneau: Yeah and it actually takes into account all of those elements of... you have the very discrete levels of damage... so if you take that shield generator from the last example and you take it in, depending on how many of those subcomponents were damaged and the degree to which they were damaged it will go through each of them to get it back up to working condition.  I imagine you would probably be able to interrupt that and be like: \"I gotta get off planet now, give me my component,\" and you'll get some not quite fully repaired version of your component and be off like that.MS: So one really good analogy that we've used for even representing this when we're designing it out &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; if you look to a lot of fighting games, specifically Marvel vs Capcom 3, it has a really good representation of this where if you think of your durability as a character's red health and their current health is their yellow bar and so when they're out of the combat getting some of that repair, they'll slowly be able to go back up to that full red bar state but they're still going to be capped at what that red bar is telling them.CR: Yeah, and that's also the limitation of field repair.  Over time there's just this attrition of your health and the components in your hull that &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; eventually &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; no matter how well you take care of your ship, you're going to eventually have to take it in to get fixed.

I don't think they would necessarily recognize you as one of their own, they would probably know the Xi'an ship you're flying is the human modified sale one, what the Scout we're doing is. Then if you're on territory you shouldn't be then maybe they would do something about it. They may potentially be a little more friendly or predisposed to you because bought something that uses their technology.In general, the Xi'an don't fire on sight against humans. For instance even though there's a bit of a stand off if you want to think of it a bit like China and America, trade together but maybe there's some idealistic differences and they kind of distrust each other but still work together pretty closely. I think that would be a good analogy for the Xi'an empire. I think if you run across Vanduul flying a captured Scythe or a Glaive, generally they would know from the scan if you're Vanduul or not.

You can have a little selfie wand..RJ: You can have a little selfie wall? Go in game chat and say hey, check out my selfie.TD: So, to that end, I think what we're talking about is a system that dynamically determines what cameras are allowed based on whether you're in a combat situation or not in FPS. So, when you're running around on Stanton, for example, or ArcCorp i should say. There's a real chance you could just have 3rd person all the time, run around, check out all the cool animations, see yourself, your gear. If you get into a situation though where you draw your weapon, or there's a known combat situation, we just disable the camera at that point, so that way we remove that... advantage.RJ: Yeah, exactly, and I think one of the things that was asked by Grump, is if I get over from just protecting myself and turning around a corner, will I lose my HUD if I go into third person, and the answer is you would. If you got shot at that point, that's just your own fault for going into third person, I would say.TD: So if you could go to third person, then you would lose your HUD, because your HUD's on your visor. And it actually literally is on your visor, it's not like a cheat. You move the camera away from the player's head you can't see the visor, cause it's actually rendered there.", "published_at": "2015-05-25", "title": "10 For the Producers Episode 07", "source": "https://youtu.be/_4Ml0-EedyU", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Gromph", "published_at_timestamp": 1432581761}, {"objectID": "373675780", "question": "As a way to recruit people to Star Citizen, have you though of bringing a facial capture rig/booth to the conventions, and letting people really flesh out the PU, and become a part of the game? Would that be more of a headache than it's worth in variety and publicity?", "answer": "Travis Day: Yes.Darian Vorlick: I like this question because it's something we were talking about with one of our animators John Riggs since we were working on that facial capture system. The idea of setting up a booth like that, while cool at E3 or something, it's not something that's viable in the immediate future. It'd take a MASSIVE amount of work to translate that into the engine.TD: I mean, it's really an economical choice, do we really want to spend however many man-hours of modelling it'd take to individually make, what, a 1000 heads we shoot at E3? First we don't need that many, we make variants just by pushing around sliders, and secondly it'd probably take us until the NEXT E3 just to process them all.DV: What about scanning your own face to play your own character?TD: Yeah, that'd actually be... Well to get the fidelity you'd need to do it on one of our setups, and it'd take a lot of work for character artists to get them into the game anyway. I mean, look at the two British looking heads we did recently, one of our cinematics guys cleaned the models up really nicely, but that took a fair amount of time.DV: The TL;DR version is that it's not as easy as taking a few photos and converting them to 3D with a click, it really wouldn't work like that.", "published_at": "2015-04-20", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 05 (2015.04.20)", "source": "https://youtu.be/YJeaYs_U-Mg", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "GeraldEvans", "published_at_timestamp": 1429567111}, {"objectID": "373676220", "question": "I know that there have been multiple questions regarding sticking on your Org logo/decals on the hull of ships, however, will there be an option to put up logos/signs etc... inside your ship?

There might be fuzzy dice, leather covered steering wheel, CR bobblehead etc. As far as customised decorations...Travis Day: Well we're thinking along the lines of like, when you see a navy bunk in a movie you see a picture of a pinup girl up on the wall or something. When we're talking about cockpit decorations stretch goals, we're talking about set items, but we're thinking about a much more holistic design specification where we have a SHIP decoration system, where you might have 4 slots to put things on this particular table, or some art slots on the wall. That'd all use the same system on the back end anyway, so we'd just have to work out where spaces can be filled on the ships and with what I guess.DV: I kinda want to have a little sticker reminder saying \"No Fear\" as I go into combat in the cockpit somewhereTD: Or something saying \"Oh shit\" somewhere too :-D", "published_at": "2015-03-16", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 04 (2015.03.16)", "source": "https://youtu.be/lstuaA4WsVA", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Crimson Hawk Moth", "published_at_timestamp": 1426543213}, {"objectID": "373676590", "question": "Would background radiation, such as that from a star or quasar, interfere with readings?

It will affect scanning and radars. If you were in that situation, you would basically (maybe not literally the sun at your back) it would be that kind of aspect. There are certain areas, like in Squadron 42 there's the coil &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; I think we've shown some concept art for that. When you're in that, your scanners don't have nearly the same range or penetration and they can go haywire.

In the current system we don't have a map that covers say, the entire surface of the planet. Instead we have something that's, say, 16km2 or maybe even 30km2 depending on how ambitious we get with our little map areas. So maybe we'd put mountain ranges or things that would block you.

Role Playing as a mechanic in a car (ship?) repair shop has been mentioned numerous times as an occupation in the persistent universe. Due to no \"level up\" of the player avatar, how would the avatar's skills improve? Would the avatar's skills improve over time similarly to real world experience? Would the rating system be the main benchmark of an avatar in various roles?", "answer": "So for me, I mean obviously there are different roles you can plan in the game, but I'm kind of a big proponent of how good you are at what you do is more informed by you as a player, and then also by the equipment you've collected and how you learn how to use it. So we're sort of a hybrid of what would happen between a traditional fantasy RPG where, you know in those you progress when you get better equipment, but you also increase your stats. For us we don't really have player stats, but we do have equipment that you can find better tuned, learn how to use better, and then as a player hopefully you can do things quicker or better than you could when you first started. So it's sort of a combination, it's sort of more driven by the equipment that you've got, the equipment that you've found, the equipment you've fixed up.NPCs will have their own internal rating system because you have to have some level of learning and progression from them. But for players it's based on your skill and based on the equipment you've collected.", "published_at": "2014-07-07", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 28.

This sort of goes to what I was saying we're gonna try to have some PvE combat encounters that go beyond just flying your spaceship.Like if you come across a space wreck and are exploring it, maybe there's some NPC pirate, AI pirates that are there who are trying to jump you and jack your ship, or perhaps there's some alien creature scurrying around the ceiling.So we're gonna try and do that, we're gonna have some places you can land and do some exploring, and maybe there's some monsters and creatures down there.We want to add a lot of color to the persistent world that way, and that's the kind of stuff we can now do, because we've obviously had a lot more funding than we thought we would originally.So that's in the list, I'm not saying that's day 1, but that's definitely all stuff that we're planning on doing content wise, and really embracing the fact that we have a very powerful first person engine.We want to use it for more than just going into bars and talking to people and going into shops and buying or selling stuff.", "published_at": "2014-06-16", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 25.

With most of the ships, the standard docking corral is in a funny place, you can't see it from the cockpit. Will the docking sequence be automatic, or will we be able to manually navigate our ships to dock with each other?", "answer": "I guess the answer would be, your ship flight computer, when you get close enough, you can auto-dock. But like everything, we'll let you try and do it yourself if you want.It may not be so easy, but in general, normally when we let you land, you can auto-land, or you can land properly if you want, and we'd probably do the same for the docking, although based on where all the docking collars are, getting close then saying auto-dock would probably be the best way to do it.", "published_at": "2014-05-19", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 21.

I don't know, I mean American Idol, usually the top 2-3 people all have record deals.But the ship will definitely be in, I'm not so sure about the weapon, maybe take that under consideration.Maybe the winning team goes back and up-reses, finishes out its weapon with our notes, and we go from there.

I don't think people think there's a necessary end-game in EVE. Maybe it's running your corporation, but there's always someone trying to take your spot, or push you off that top perch, which is pretty much the way I think Star Citizen is gonna work.I think if you're into the economy side and you want to be more of an entrepreneur, and build up businesses or industries, that's really going to be around buying and owning a production node. Which essentially is a factory, and then running that in terms of making sure that you're getting the right raw materials, and you're doing well, then perhaps you can expand and buy another production node somewhere else and build up your economic empire. In that case I would think you would probably be spending a fair amount of time managing resources and hiring other people to do the work. Like bring cargo from A to B, have people to defend it, and all that stuff.So I would say that would be the high level game if you're interested in that level of the game verses just the flying around, combat side.", "published_at": "2014-03-24", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 13 (2014.03.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/IIkeFs5xubw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Jomanda", "published_at_timestamp": 1395698672}]
