United Empire of Earth (UEE) forces, depleted after four years of battle, were unable to mount a suitable defense against the invading Vanduul, who pursued them once Tiber fell. Although the system was lost, the UEE Navy was able to cover the retreat of over one million refugees. </p><br/><h1>BUILDUP</h1><br/><p>Before 2681 and the events of Vanduul-Human First Contact, the Virgil system was on an upward trajectory. As the launchpoint of Project Far Star, it was both a hub for explorers and a symbol of the UEE's continual outward expansion. Cyrene (Virgil I) was growing to be an economic powerhouse, having both a thriving resort industry due to its beautiful, lush landscapes and a robust agricultural system fed by highly fertile soil. However, when the Vanduul began launching regular raids in Virgil, the system's growth slowed. Project Far Star and talks of Senatorial recognition for Cyrene were put on hold pending resolution of the worsening Vanduul-Human conflict. </p><br/><p>After the Orion system fell to the Vanduul in 2712, the military forces stationed there retreated into the Tiber system, where they set up a line of defense in anticipation of a forthcoming assault. With the mounting threat to its neighboring systems, Virgil's already faltering tourism industry collapsed, and the system was soon transformed into a military outpost.</p><br/><p>At the start of the Siege of Tiber in 2732, the population of Cyrene dropped to a few million people as all those with the means to do so fled. Countless others who did not have the resources to escape on their own applied to the government to help them relocate, but the Imperator Galor Messer IX refused to grant any aid, stating that Cyrene could not afford to lose more workers. Many turned to smugglers to help them flee, but some remained behind, believing that the might of the UEE would eventually prevail. Their faith appeared on the verge of paying off in November 2736, when the UEE conducted a bombing run on Tiber II and destroyed all Vanduul encampments there, enabling them to retake the planet, the Tiber belt alpha, and the Vector-Tiber jump point. Two UEE Navy Battle Groups departed the system for repairs, and two more remained to pick off the few remaining Vanduul. It seemed that the UEE was on the verge of victory. </p><br/><p>On 29 December 2736, the tide abruptly turned. A Kingship accompanied by an enormous Vanduul Clan entered Tiber through the Orion-Tiber jump point and opened fire on the 81st Battle Group. Within half a day, three quarters of their ships were destroyed. Admiral Mira Triolo ordered them to retreat into Virgil while she remained behind with the 6th Battle Group to hold the line. </p><br/><h1>THE INVASION</h1><br/><p>When the remains of the 81st entered Virgil it set off a panic. Millions of people who remained in the system clamored to be evacuated ahead of a potential Vanduul invasion. Citing the actions of the Vanduul in the aftermath of the Battle of Orion, the Governors Council of Cyrene issued a statement assuring the public that a secondary invasion was unlikely to occur, and that they had sent a message to the Imperator requesting immediate military assistance. This helped calm things enough to avoid the threat of riots while the Council, with the help of the 81st, was able to organize an evacuation effort that succeeded in transporting over one million evacuees through the Vega and Oberon jump points over three standard days.</p><br/><p>On 2 January 2737 the 6th Battle Group in Tiber fell. Within hours, the Kingship and its accompanying Clan entered the Virgil system headed straight for Cyrene, making landfall at the city of Kastak and launching an all-out assault on the planet. The remnants of the 81st could offer little resistance, but elected to do all they could to hold off the Vanduul while the last transports fled the system under the protection of Squadron 214. When the final transport made it through the Vega jump point, Squadron 214 turned back to attempt to rescue more people. They were able to complete two more runs before they were unable to continue.</p><br/><p>The Vanduul continued their assault against Cyrene and the rest of the system unabated until no other life remained. The surface of Cyrene was reduced to nothing, casting a cloud of radioactive ash into the atmosphere that created nuclear winter. Hundreds of thousands of Humans and Tevarin that were unable to escape perished. Those who had not died during the initial Vanduul onslaught soon starved or succumbed to radiation poisoning. </p><br/><h1>AFTERMATH, ANALYSIS, AND IMPACT</h1><br/><p>The military aid that the Governors Council of Cyrene had requested did not arrive until well over a week later. By that point, the Virgil system was completely overrun. Instead of entering the system and ousting the Vanduul, the military created a defensive line around the jump point to Virgil in anticipation of another assault. As with the loss of the Orion system, the attack did not immediately occur, and the Vanduul began to harvest Virgil's resources. Multiple scouting missions came back with reports that Cyrene was irrecoverable. In 2743, the UEE announced that they would not retake the system.</p><br/><p>Suddenly finding themselves on the front line, residents of the neighboring Vega system took what happened in Virgil as a cautionary tale and began to flee in droves, severely impacting the system's economy. Evacuees from Virgil, most of whom had little in their possession but their clothing, suffered food shortages as they awaited resettlement. Some were able to relocate to other systems, but the majority stayed near the military bases on Aremis (Vega II) and took any jobs that they could. Historians believe that this may have prevented the system's economy from entering a true depression, though it did not avert a recession. Today, over a quarter of people born in the Vega system can trace their lineage back to former residents of Cyrene. </p><br/><p>The destruction of the Virgil system deeply affected the UEE. While Orion's loss had been significant, it was a young colony and had not undergone significant development, and Tiber was a sparsely-populated mining system with only small settlements. Virgil had over 300 years of history and was a major system with a world on the verge of recognition. As the heart of Project Far Star, it was also a symbol of the UEE's continual expansion. The UEE Navy's defeat at Tiber and subsequent failure to protect Virgil shook the people's confidence in the military and in the UEE at large. Historians cite the Fall of Virgil one of the many motivating factors that eventually led to the anti-Messer revolution in 2792.

Kamposi was an omnivorous apex predator with a dense, solid, compact skeleton adapted for the high-gravity, high-pressure environment of Kampos\u2019 deep oceans. Though the exact cause of its extinction is unknown, it is hypothesized from fossil records that an underwater volcanic eruption may have triggered  an extinction event that disrupted the kamposi\u2019s food chain. The Governors Council of Ellis IV chose to name its planet Kampos after the kamposi magnus upon receiving recognition from the UEE Senate in 2562.</p><br/><h6>DISCOVERY</h6><br/><p>In 2488, colonist Gary Yahontov of Ellis IV in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) discovered a large fossilized skull while dredging along the shore of his settlement. Yahontov used it as a piece of decoration in his yard for six years. Vira Kamposi, an academic passing through to study gravitational effects on local planet life, stole the fossil in 2493 and transported it via spacecraft to her former teachers at the University of Rhetor. Members of the paleontology department identified it as an undiscovered species and dispatched a research team to Ellis IV. A complete fossilized skeleton was discovered in 2496, 57 kilometers from Yahontov\u2019s home. Already nicknamed kamposi by the team, the researchers appended magnus to the name after the skeleton measured 11 meters long. The first herd of kamposi was discovered in 2543, challenging early conjecture that the kamposi was solitary.</p><br/><p>When she returned to Ellis IV in 2494, Kamposi was arrested and convicted of theft, after which she served six months in prison. Yahontov successfully sued the University of Rhetor in 2501 for repatriation of the skull. It sat in his yard until his death in 2536, upon which it was confiscated by the government of Ellis IV.</p><br/><h6>DESCRIPTION</h6><br/><p>Reconstructions of the kamposi reveal that it could grow up to 12 meters in length and typically weighed about 40 tonnes. It had four eyes, two pairs of jointed mandibles around its mouth, and a pair of broad tusks on either side of its head. The teeth along the inside of its jaw and analysis of its bones indicate that it consumed both meat and vegetable matter. The mandibles likely facilitated quick consumption of prey, and the tusks probably aided in dredging up bottom-dwellers and uprooting plants from the ocean bed.</p><br/><h6>EXTINCTION</h6><br/><p>About 500,000 years ago, a supervolcano located near Kampos\u2019 equator erupted underwater, causing planetwide tsunamis, substantial seismic shifts, and mass extinctions. The kamposi vanished from the fossil record shortly after the eruption took place. Analysis of kamposi tusks from several thousand years prior to this event indicate that there were no long-term stressors that might have contributed to its demise</p><br/><h6>CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE</h6><br/><p>The kamposi is considered a symbol of Kampos. Mostly covered in ocean, Kampos is home to a wide spectrum of aquatic life. The kamposi was one of the first major discoveries to come out of Kampos in its colony days. Possibly because it received a moderate amount of fame in the popular media after the first academic publication on it nicknamed the kamposi \"lords of the deep,\" early inhabitants of Ellis IV embraced it as an emblem of their planet\u2019s oceans and unique biodiversity.</p><br/><p>In 2945, a scale replica of the kampos skull first discovered by Gary Yahontov debuted in the Puglisi Collection.

And Star Audio is absolutely planned to replace all this stuff and improve all these situations. So in the example of weapon fire cutting out, we have a much more intelligent budgeting system that will take into account the importance of those sounds to the player at that moment, whether they're visible on screen, how close they are, how many other sounds in the similar categories are playing. So we can definitely improve all those things with Star Audio. It's just a case of working through all our systems because we have audio systems hooked into pretty much everything the game can do.

Well, I'm going to go stealth right now, but I'm going really quiet  So we kind of see, well like personally I see stealth as  A ship that is, you know, its main ability is to mask itself So you can hide and you can be sneaky, you know So it's got that more kind of tactics to it Where you can use the environment to hide You know, and you can move your resources of the ship to kind of manage that So you can kind of control how much you're seen in the universe So you can plan something, you know, plan to sneak up on someone or just plan to attack someone And that's where I see stealth in the game  You know, and it's going to become really quick, well it's going to be a really cool resource network Because that's going to give you really good control over how, you know, kind of stealth you go Because you can take it much further than you can now<br/><br/>Johnny: Yeah, for sure, yeah  On the resource network thing, there's already talks of like how heat and cooling can influence stealth and emissions With ships, the emissions is going to be really what the stealth is, I guess So if you can hide, like I guess there's two kinds of versions of stealth You're either not there, or people think you're not there Or people think you're something else So you could have like emissions that pretend you're some casual cargo hauler But you're actually a fleet of Idris's And just to try and pretend that you're not for a while Like there's stories of like stealth fighters who like  Because of the way the stealth fighters emissions profile is set up When they get hit by a radar signature and it deflects off all the different faces of the plane And then it comes back and the radar sees it and is like, oh that's just like a pigeon That's nothing to worry about And then suddenly the pigeon turns into a stealth aircraft for like two seconds Because it's opened its bay doors and then closes it again and goes  That pigeon turned into a plane for a bit Maybe we should shoot something at it So something like that You can have the two different versions of like we hide it completely Like clamp the emissions completely so you can't be seen in a big radius Or you can just blare out like noise and obscure whatever you want And so like with resource network if you have If that gets tied into heat and stuff You can have coolers that are like blaring out loads of IR for example They could pretend to be something else And then if you want to go the other route and then like hide all of those emissions Turn all your coolers off or like have some kind of thermal shielding around it And then you just slowly cook in your ship because it's heating up Because that heat is supposed to go somewhere That's what the emission is normally And if it's not emitting heat I guess you're just going to steam slowly", "source": "https://youtu.be/6FVxbM8oeVA", "title": "Star Citizen Live: Ask the Devs - Vehicle Gameplay", "type": "youtube", "published_at_timestamp": 1694802086}, {"objectID": "10157b88a20d95_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The key advantage is the combination of both a quantum jammer and an EMP device, whereas the Cutlass Blue and Sentinel only have one of the two.

And what technical hurdles do we have to overcome before we can start seeing some of the systems in the Reclaimer come online?", "answer": "The big hurdles are the Physical Inventory that they talked about, and also Player Interaction regarding character-based salvaging (like salvaging components by removing them from their slots). One hurdle that the Art Vehicle Team has is that there are debris entities created when a ship is destroyed, and right now when that happens they take the item, move it over, and then it's magically moved - it doesn't have any pipe connections or persistent info, so it'll just spawn, vanish, and that's it. They need a more robust system to keep them there, to extract items, and then maybe also the resources on those debris pieces. Otherwise, if you blow up a ship and look inside it looks like an empty husk, and maybe a seat is floating. Ships spawn with Object Containers inside of the ship, and they want those to remain when a ship turns into a debris piece, but there are some tech limits on why they don't. So if you were to put a Big Benny's inside a Cutlass and it then explodes, you'd want them, or any other items that were inside, to still be there. As such, they have to solve how they're going to keep those, and transfer those Object Containers and what's inside them to the debris pieces, so that whatever mechanic is used, Players could extract those things outside of the debris piece or turn chunks into some sort of commodity. Mark Abent has seen prototypes of the mining laser being used to extract salvage, but that's just a \"what if we did this\" situation and not final. Really, it's unclear what Salvage will look like and what hurdles there will definitely be. Even if Salvage ends up being \"mining ships\" at the least that will be the first iteration for Players to try out, before the Devs get something more complicated out.", "published_at_timestamp": 1558137330}, {"objectID": "947638900", "title": "Calling All Devs - Calling All Papys, Part II", "question": "What is the deal with the Hull C?", "source": "https://youtu.be/DQA1-nT6ev4", "type": "youtube", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "time": "0m51s", "answer": "", "published_at_timestamp": 1532372924}, {"objectID": "56b345de08054_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The 12 SCU cargo space is the cargo grid for both cubes and scavenged items which you wish to legitimately store.

I mean, I had some ideas about how to sort of up the emotional attachment and the story aspects of it, and I wanted to put you sort of first person, and I felt like the technology moved a lot so we could have better looking characters, and so it didn't need to be sort of the old wing command, like wing three or wing four. We filmed actors because we didn't feel like we could get performance into the rudimentary animation for the characters aboard the ship, which is why we had a wing one and two. But it's, yeah, it's, I mean, it's way, I mean, in terms of scope, scale, what we can do, because there's a lot of technology, you know, like the procedural planet stuff we saw we went down to Gainey, which is this moon, we used to be a moon of Odin 1, which is, Odin 1 is now really the coil. And so the opportunity, like when I was first conceiving it, we were, you know, even when we were writing the script for it, we were thinking we were gonna have to sort of hide basically level loads behind cinematics and stuff that you would stream when we're doing it. This is all, you know, gonna, all plays live in the engine seamlessly, and I think in terms of like emotional attachment and story that you're gonna have in the game, it's going to be, I think it's gonna, I think it's going to have an effect on people that they're not gonna expect. So I, we spend so much time creating, you know, sort of arcs and stories for all the characters you come across. So you see a little bit, like, so for instance, you know, one of the scenes in the holiday livestream I really like is the moment where you talk to, you know, Liam Cunningham's character, you know, Captain White, and he's asked you how you're doing and it gets to on his son and you can see the performance. I mean, that's a great actor and he's there and you can sort of see, you know, there's some, you know, there's something on, there's not- Something happened. Yeah, and it's like, you know, there's a regret and there's a sadness and there's, you know, it makes him feel real. He's not just the captain that gives you a mission. And we have that across the board for the crew of the Stanton and a lot of other characters that you'll meet through the course of the story. And you don't necessarily have to engage in these. So the concept is, as a player, you play the game and you sort of interact with people that you want to interact with, you know. Then maybe certain players will prefer to interact with certain characters than another player would want to interact with. And that's actually kind of interesting because that was the Wing Commander one thing. I was always interested that, you know, some people loved Maniac and some people hated him, right? It was like, it was very valorizing. But you know, that was player agency and choice and they just, because they made the choice, there was this extra attachment to it. And for, in Squadron, you know, we've really, you know, everybody has, you know, there's these personal stories and character arcs that aren't necessarily related to the actual story itself that you're going to go on. But as you spend time and interact with these characters, I really feel like you're, they're not going to just feel like, oh, this is an AI character. You're going to sort of see them as people. And then, of course, you know, the story of Squadron, you know, it wouldn't be very interesting unless stuff happened. So there's some pretty, you know, momentous or tragic stuff that would happen. And it obviously will have effect on characters that you've met and hopefully built an affinity for a relationship with. And so I actually think your emotional attachment as you go through the story, you know, is going to be of a level that maybe, you know, has not happened yet in games or has happened very rarely in games. And that will just mean that what you're doing and what the action will mean that much more. So I'm, and I can feel little bits of it now and I can see it and I know all our scenes and stories and, you know, when we finish off at the level that we're doing, I think it's going to be really cool. And it's sort of a subtle thing, but I'm really interested to see how that ends up affecting people.

When I leave my moving ship I instantly stop relative to the ship. Following Newton's First Law of Motion I should remain at the same speed as my ship, and be able to do an EVA regardless of velocity i.e. 2001 a Space Odyssey. Will this ever be an option in the game?", "answer": "This is something we've debated internally. The conflict with it is, we want to cap your individual player velocity so it doesn't become too big to control or arrest. For instance your EVA pack doesn't have nearly the amount of fuel or thrust power that say, for instance, your spaceship would necessarily have. Although the other flip side of that, is that you should inherit the velocity of your parent object. So if you step off a Freelancer that's going 200 m/s, I should probably be flying 200 m/s, or moving at 200 m/s.We sort of go back and forth on our debate on this because essentially what happens is the EVA system has several thresholds. One, it has a normal one which is 15 m/s, and then it has the \"boost\" one, which is 50 m/s maybe 100 m/s, I honestly can't remember what that is. Those are the ranges that it caps you in, in the same way that ships themselves are capped.Don't forget that there is only a certain amount of thrust on your EVA pack. So there's a certain point where, just for instance if you were like designing it so people couldn't get themselves in trouble, you probably would cap how fast you would let them accelerate to because they would need to have enough thrust available for them to decelerate back down to zero; or else you would get up to a certain speed and you would never be able to stop unless someone else stopped you. As an individual in an EVA suit, getting stopped when you're at a fast speed would either be very painful, fatal, or would take someone a lot of care to do. That's kind of it. We sort of have the trade off. I would think that what we would probably do, is if you went out EVAing at speed, you would go out at speed and it would bleed your speed down to a more controllable amount, but you should inherit the velocity of your parent ship. I don't know whether we'd let you open the airlock doors and get out when you're in cruise or anything really fast.

It's sort of two layer system where your ship or your component is going to have so much durability to it and that's like its maximum health pool and then you'll have its current repair state which is its current health and so you'll be able to repair a destroyed ship or a broken component up to that maximum durability point and that will be a quicker action... so a few minutes, maybe a little bit longer if it's a really big capital ship or like a Hull series.  But when you want to raise that durability back up and raise its max potential, that's going to be more taking it to a refurbishing shop and you will have to drop the component off for a little bit of time where it may be a day, a couple hours.  It will really vary based on the size and the damage.  But then that shop is going to bring your durability back up to full and give it back to you in a lot better condition than when you dropped it off.Calix Reneau: Yeah and it actually takes into account all of those elements of... you have the very discrete levels of damage... so if you take that shield generator from the last example and you take it in, depending on how many of those subcomponents were damaged and the degree to which they were damaged it will go through each of them to get it back up to working condition.  I imagine you would probably be able to interrupt that and be like: \"I gotta get off planet now, give me my component,\" and you'll get some not quite fully repaired version of your component and be off like that.MS: So one really good analogy that we've used for even representing this when we're designing it out &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; if you look to a lot of fighting games, specifically Marvel vs Capcom 3, it has a really good representation of this where if you think of your durability as a character's red health and their current health is their yellow bar and so when they're out of the combat getting some of that repair, they'll slowly be able to go back up to that full red bar state but they're still going to be capped at what that red bar is telling them.CR: Yeah, and that's also the limitation of field repair.  Over time there's just this attrition of your health and the components in your hull that &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; eventually &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; no matter how well you take care of your ship, you're going to eventually have to take it in to get fixed.

I don't think they would necessarily recognize you as one of their own, they would probably know the Xi'an ship you're flying is the human modified sale one, what the Scout we're doing is. Then if you're on territory you shouldn't be then maybe they would do something about it. They may potentially be a little more friendly or predisposed to you because bought something that uses their technology.In general, the Xi'an don't fire on sight against humans. For instance even though there's a bit of a stand off if you want to think of it a bit like China and America, trade together but maybe there's some idealistic differences and they kind of distrust each other but still work together pretty closely. I think that would be a good analogy for the Xi'an empire. I think if you run across Vanduul flying a captured Scythe or a Glaive, generally they would know from the scan if you're Vanduul or not. Probably go after you in fairly short order although if you had a captured one that was rigged to spoof being part of a Vanduul clan, then perhaps you may be able to slip through or slip by.

Right now obviously there's one starting location in Stanton but that's going to change as we add more places with content.It's too early to say we will give you a choice and maybe it will be related to some of the preferences you want to do.

Yes, we're actually completely disabling the third person camera for FPS, so don't be concerned about that. One of the things we were talking about is, we have these beautiful models, we have these beautiful animations, we want to be able to show them off. We want you to be able to be in your hangar, dress up, check it out, that's kind of the fun part, you play an MMO, you get some new gear, you get fitted, check it out, you take a selfie or whatever, so that part we want to be able to have that experience.Ricky Jutley: Selfies.TD: Yeah, selfies. You can have a little selfie wand..RJ: You can have a little selfie wall? Go in game chat and say hey, check out my selfie.TD: So, to that end, I think what we're talking about is a system that dynamically determines what cameras are allowed based on whether you're in a combat situation or not in FPS. So, when you're running around on Stanton, for example, or ArcCorp i should say. There's a real chance you could just have 3rd person all the time, run around, check out all the cool animations, see yourself, your gear. If you get into a situation though where you draw your weapon, or there's a known combat situation, we just disable the camera at that point, so that way we remove that... advantage.RJ: Yeah, exactly, and I think one of the things that was asked by Grump, is if I get over from just protecting myself and turning around a corner, will I lose my HUD if I go into third person, and the answer is you would. If you got shot at that point, that's just your own fault for going into third person, I would say.TD: So if you could go to third person, then you would lose your HUD, because your HUD's on your visor. And it actually literally is on your visor, it's not like a cheat.

The idea of setting up a booth like that, while cool at E3 or something, it's not something that's viable in the immediate future.

First we don't need that many, we make variants just by pushing around sliders, and secondly it'd probably take us until the NEXT E3 just to process them all.DV: What about scanning your own face to play your own character?TD: Yeah, that'd actually be... Well to get the fidelity you'd need to do it on one of our setups, and it'd take a lot of work for character artists to get them into the game anyway. I mean, look at the two British looking heads we did recently, one of our cinematics guys cleaned the models up really nicely, but that took a fair amount of time.DV: The TL;DR version is that it's not as easy as taking a few photos and converting them to 3D with a click, it really wouldn't work like that.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 05 (2015.04.20)", "source": "https://youtu.be/YJeaYs_U-Mg", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "GeraldEvans", "published_at_timestamp": 1429567111}, {"objectID": "373676220", "question": "I know that there have been multiple questions regarding sticking on your Org logo/decals on the hull of ships, however, will there be an option to put up logos/signs etc... inside your ship?

When we're talking about cockpit decorations stretch goals, we're talking about set items, but we're thinking about a much more holistic design specification where we have a SHIP decoration system, where you might have 4 slots to put things on this particular table, or some art slots on the wall.

It will affect scanning and radars. If you were in that situation, you would basically (maybe not literally the sun at your back) it would be that kind of aspect. There are certain areas, like in Squadron 42 there's the coil &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; I think we've shown some concept art for that.

In the current system we don't have a map that covers say, the entire surface of the planet. Instead we have something that's, say, 16km2 or maybe even 30km2 depending on how ambitious we get with our little map areas. So maybe we'd put mountain ranges or things that would block you.

Role Playing as a mechanic in a car (ship?) repair shop has been mentioned numerous times as an occupation in the persistent universe. Due to no \"level up\" of the player avatar, how would the avatar's skills improve? Would the avatar's skills improve over time similarly to real world experience? Would the rating system be the main benchmark of an avatar in various roles?", "answer": "So for me, I mean obviously there are different roles you can plan in the game, but I'm kind of a big proponent of how good you are at what you do is more informed by you as a player, and then also by the equipment you've collected and how you learn how to use it. So we're sort of a hybrid of what would happen between a traditional fantasy RPG where, you know in those you progress when you get better equipment, but you also increase your stats. For us we don't really have player stats, but we do have equipment that you can find better tuned, learn how to use better, and then as a player hopefully you can do things quicker or better than you could when you first started. So it's sort of a combination, it's sort of more driven by the equipment that you've got, the equipment that you've found, the equipment you've fixed up.NPCs will have their own internal rating system because you have to have some level of learning and progression from them.

This sort of goes to what I was saying we're gonna try to have some PvE combat encounters that go beyond just flying your spaceship.Like if you come across a space wreck and are exploring it, maybe there's some NPC pirate, AI pirates that are there who are trying to jump you and jack your ship, or perhaps there's some alien creature scurrying around the ceiling.So we're gonna try and do that, we're gonna have some places you can land and do some exploring, and maybe there's some monsters and creatures down there.We want to add a lot of color to the persistent world that way, and that's the kind of stuff we can now do, because we've obviously had a lot more funding than we thought we would originally.So that's in the list, I'm not saying that's day 1, but that's definitely all stuff that we're planning on doing content wise, and really embracing the fact that we have a very powerful first person engine.We want to use it for more than just going into bars and talking to people and going into shops and buying or selling stuff.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 25.

But like everything, we'll let you try and do it yourself if you want.It may not be so easy, but in general, normally when we let you land, you can auto-land, or you can land properly if you want, and we'd probably do the same for the docking, although based on where all the docking collars are, getting close then saying auto-dock would probably be the best way to do it.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 21.

I don't know, I mean American Idol, usually the top 2-3 people all have record deals.But the ship will definitely be in, I'm not so sure about the weapon, maybe take that under consideration.Maybe the winning team goes back and up-reses, finishes out its weapon with our notes, and we go from there.

I don't think people think there's a necessary end-game in EVE. Maybe it's running your corporation, but there's always someone trying to take your spot, or push you off that top perch, which is pretty much the way I think Star Citizen is gonna work.I think if you're into the economy side and you want to be more of an entrepreneur, and build up businesses or industries, that's really going to be around buying and owning a production node. Which essentially is a factory, and then running that in terms of making sure that you're getting the right raw materials, and you're doing well, then perhaps you can expand and buy another production node somewhere else and build up your economic empire. In that case I would think you would probably be spending a fair amount of time managing resources and hiring other people to do the work.
