Previously they used to have what they called \"support screens\" which were screens with minimal information on them, with a font size that made the information more legible. They're looking to have a system where by default, the MFDs will be in this minimised configuration where they only show the information that you really need to know, and they do so in a way that's readable without focusing on the display. However, when you then focus on the display, they want it to contextually change to something more in-depth, which can work because now the MFD has more screen-space to show readable information. Zane adds that the cool thing about the UI tech he's helping to develop, is that they're taking cues from web development (which is also his background so he knows a lot about it) where there's a thing called \"responsive design\". This is where you can have a rule set up so that, if there's a box in their UI that goes beyond a certain point, it then shrinks down, and you can have different styles applied to that, and conditionally so depending on the size of the box. As such they're leveraging that to help with the reformulation of the UI on screens, and it could also be helpful when they potentially implement customisation of HUDs/UIs as a tool to manage and maintain it. Right now in-game they have different sized screens, where each size has its own binary file, meaning that if they want to change one then they have to go into each binary file and make a change. But if they can maintain just one UI, which then has different style rules applied to it, then that makes it much easier to maintain. So changing one thing would then make that change for each different manufacturer, and every kind of configuration. Simon adds that regarding the actual process right now, they're looking through the designs that already exist in-game and working closely with the vehicles team to figure out what they want to show on the screens, to plan out what's going to be in all of the MFDs, so that they can then redesign each screen to achieve its maximum potential based upon what information needs to be shown. After that, the UI tech will eventually reach a point where the screen's are redesigned and the tech's ready to be put into the game.", "title": "Star Citizen Live: All Things UI", "source": "https://youtu.be/6lSmdJ5UydE", "transcript": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/cg2gwf/a_summary_of_star_citizen_live_all_things_ui/", "type": "youtube", "time": "45m45s", "published_at_timestamp": 1563572591}, {"objectID": "c4d880bc19844_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Tractor beams consume massive amounts of power, so while the ship's top speed is still attainable, acceleration and fuel economy are negatively impacted.

We want our star systems to reflect both real world physics and playability. So we want something that takes both of these into account so you actually enjoy yourself when you're playing the game. The systems themselves are designed to stay within a rough range that keeps them small enough that they can work with the technology that we have, but they're large enough so you can actually enjoy being in them and exploring them.So we have a little balance between fiction and reality. which is something we've done with the systems in the past like Vega for example: there is a real star Vega, which is an A-type main sequence star in the lyra constellation. However our star: Vega, an ingame star that's made up completely for the game is a G-type main sequence star much like our own sun. So that I feel like that's a really good example of the balance we strike between what is real and what is in our game, but takes inspiration from reality.Forrest Stephan: And I think that also kind of... that's this games niche that I think it does so well is the consistency that it keeps between pure simulation and pure game and it has this beautiful in between kind of towards the simulation, but it still has so many of those game aspects that makes it fun to play and that's what kind of makes this game I think, it's going to be pretty special and awesome.CH: So to answer the core of your question.

How do you go about attracting the type of people that would work on this project and retain them?", "answer": "Gaige Hallman: Wow.Eric Kieron Davis: I was really excited about this question because hiring and recruiting, it's crucial to a creative project, I mean it's crucial in any company where you need to work with other people.GH: Oh yeah.EKD: But within a creative project, working under the tutelage of Chris Roberts were really looking for what strengths we need at that time as well as the future. So a lot of this comes down to where do we currently sit with talent, what do we have across the entire studio, not just here in LA, but what do we have across the entire globe and we evaluate the staff, we evaluate our talents and we see, \"Okay this is what we need to do to accomplish these goals\" and this is what we think we need for the next six months, year, two years, infinity as we're working and playing this game and having fun as it comes out.So it's a really great question because we're looking for all kinds of things, one of them is a culture fit. You want somebody that kind of fits into the environment that we're trying to create. You don't always just need to find somebody with the skills, skills you can teach, but personalities you can't, culture you can't teach. So a lot of time it's about finding the someone that fits into what we're trying to make.GH: And we do have a great team here.EKD: We do, LA has a great team, all the teams are starting to come together really, really well as we start solidifying the future plans and I like this one a lot because I spend a lot of time with the leads and with the director's looking at how can we make the experience not just great for our current staff, but for future staff and for future employees and family members. I mean these people are going to spend a lot of our waking hours with.GH: Yeah we've developed a lot of close bonds here.EKD: Totally. So there's a lot of things that go into it. I mean if we're looking for a specific thing, so if we talk for instance about the Associate Tech Animator role we just opened up. That role which we just closed we just found a candidate, we're excited about that. We were looking for somebody that could implement manikin, right? That specifically work in manikin work, work with the animation team for our Persistence Universe. So it was a very specific thing we needed, but there were obviously a ton of other things we were looking for.So applicants who are looking for if they had that experience, that would be great. If they could work within this environment, the Tech Content Team that Sean leads that, Gaige is apart of, it's kind of anamorphosis type of team. So it's you know, can you roll with the punches, can you flow with things as they come in, it's a unique kind of team. So we're looking for culture, we're looking for experience, we're looking for talent and then we want to get you in here and so we can meet you to see and talk to you and see if you're the right fit. So there's a lot of things that go into it.And then \"how do we attract it?\" We keep making cool stuff, we keep making this cool stuff as we possibly can and try to make an impact like we're trying to do and try to get out there and go to hiring events as needed whenever we need candidates.And retaining them? I don't know I mean.GH: We've done a pretty good job so far I think.EKD: Yeah I think we try to house an environment that's fun to work in, that somebody wants to stay and invest their life in, invest their time in. You know we may spend a lot of hours here working on this game and these games and all the things we want to come out with.GH: Especially with this studio it's been a lot better.EKD: Yeah.GH: To work in.EKD: Totally and it's weird how those little environment tweaks can make all the difference, it makes them want to stay forever for for awhile at least. It's a tough question and it's an ever going question for every studio and every company out there, but for us we want you to be passionate about what we're doing, about the scale and the scope of what we're trying to create, working alongside chris and the fantastic team that we've all built here and then ultimately make an impact with us.We want somebody that's going to bring in their talents and their unique strengths. It's not beneficial to have the same type of person across the entire studio or globe. We want diversity, we want different types of personalities, we want a quiet shy person with a loud gregarious person, like you want those types of personalities because they will create a better environment, a more dynamic environment where we can challenge each other to be better. If we're all the same, we don't necessarily do that per say.GH: Right, yeah.EKD: We'll just stick with what we're good at and that's it.And it's games so we'll attract gamers and people that like making games and so we kind of get things naturally by being a game company.", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 10", "source": "https://youtu.be/PbTQWmXFuM0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Daz", "published_at_timestamp": 1463434781}, {"objectID": "2b524deb952fd_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The containers will have a mass value depending on what is stored in them and how full they are.

You are- you are travelling at such great speed that any course deviation would either have to be done either incredibly slowly or you'd basically be turned to jelly from the g-forces that are being exerted. Because point-two the speed of light &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; that's very fast.And the idea is that it's just a space line shots- you'll need to line up where you go and if any large object gets in your way like a ship or gravity well or anything like that- celestial body- you get pulled out of quantum drive because it's essentially a hand-wavy science fiction phrase- it creates a gravity bubble around you that also helps accelerate you up to a really fast speed and then you do the opposite because- I mean, even just going from two-three-four-five hundred meters per second to point-two the speed of light in whatever it is- a few seconds- is an incredible amount of acceleration so unless you're in your own gravity bubble you'd still be squashed and it only works basically in a straight line.Which is cool because it allows emergent gameplay- see if you know which direction someone's flying you could track their quantum jump and radio ahead, don't forget that's at the speed of light instead of 0.2c though depending how far they're going you'd have to have a distance for someone to have their trajectory and you could deploy say a interdiction device which we think of like a gravity well that will pull you out in the appropriate place and then interdict the person that's flying it.

It has a very similar flight deck where it's sort of encased, but can open up and you can fly in and out of it.We will have some other ships that will be more like sort of helipad style. So if you think about say some modern day ships, they have a helipad or a hangar for a helicopter and stuff like that. There'll definitely be some sort of drop down where bays open up and you drop down on some ships and ships can land and be inside it and of course you have some sort of parasite style ships which the Constellation is a good example, where there's a Merlin that's docked in the back that you can get in and fly around. So we'll have various different styles, I think for instance the Vanduul carrier has a different sort of launching and sort of loading mechanism for the ships it's not quite the same for the human ones which makes sense because they're alien.

You can do anything.

And, from a lore perspective, it makes sense that there would be some kind of treaty that the UEE would have implemented or codified this idea, because it does seem to be an important one. That said, much like in the real world, just because we maybe create this in lore, doesn't mean that it's going to function in game. There are plenty of other examples, even unfortunately recently of the geneva convention being, this act of the geneva convention not working out very well with various civil wars around the world, so I don't think the Vanduul would necessarily agree with that. I don't think that a lot of lawless systems would also probably not care. There's probably other players and even other pirates that would, in UEE territory, target that for their own means. So, though it's an interesting idea, I wouldn't be surprised if something shows up. I don't think it would ever be a game rule, or a game mechanic. It may just be more of a moral compass that will be there. So if we create this in the lore, you can help define your character better by having them in that situation and then making the choice of whether, do they help, do they protect, do they just let it go, do they attack? So again, I think it's an important aspect of the game, but i don't think it'll ever be quite a game rule where, if you do attack it automatically means something bad's going to happen.Cherie Heiberg: Again, we don't want to infringe on the way you want to develop your character.

Could you provide examples of each?", "answer": "Omar Aweidah: So I guess, when I'm concepting, to try and make something really unique, generally we try to stick away from sci-fi. For example, with weapons I would look more towards different pieces of machinery, maybe drills or power tools or things that aren't necessarily already considered weapons, maybe even like remote control submarines and all sorts of weird electronics, that way you kind of get a little bit new original shapes and ideas, but then at the same time a lot of the direction calls towards pre-existing sci-fi, for example certain ships from Halo or Firefly or Elysium and all these other things, we're thinking about this kind of feel for this kind of ship, and it's a great way to put you in the right direction, but then once you kind of understand that, you start to go deeper and look at a variety of different objects and different references, but really something that's just completely creative and organic, something that's like conceptual, it just comes during the design process, it's not something that necessarily I would look for, or I would try to do. I'd gather reference, I'd do a lot of research, and whatever happens during the creative process, that's what's organic. But generally I don't try to create anything straight automatically.Forrest Stephan: Cause, when you're making a ship or a weapon, they're machines right? So you don't just make a weapon, you gotta do the research to figure out how would you actually build this, if I was going to, theoretically, build this in real life. So you can investigate on different types of...OA: No, totally. Like, engineering. Like, you're a designer, but you're also semi an engineer. But you have to make cool art. But we don't necessarily take everything to the fullest level of fully fully functionality, but we try to make it as functional as possible, with the knowledge that we know, and the more weapons you do the more realistic it gets. Ships, the more ships you build the more you create the more you know, this is my route for getting reference and inspiration and all sorts of stuff.FS: And then we definitely like to keep, there's different styles to different weapons and different ships which, a lot of the times the parts that we do look at will be from different eras, so maybe one style for one weapon and one ship is more WWII style, and maybe another ship and another weapons is maybe more slick, modern, and chic, and then we look at more modern parts and things that are being created today and that kind of helps define the different styles, so we visit different time periods that we pull our inspirations from.OA: Totally. And each corporation, so many corporations, so many manufacturers, they each kind of have their own unique style. For example, Apocalypse Arms, they're like, Detroit biker gang, that would be the design brief. How can we take a Detroit biking community and make them science fiction.FS: Yeah, exactly.OA: So...FS: Yeah, alright.

The Foundry 42 guys were pretty anxious to take on extra stuff, and I have absolute faith that they're going to do a kick-butt job.TD: Yeah, and-... [to Darian] nice censoring, that was good! ... One of the other things about the Foundry 42 guys is, that ship will be making an appearance or two, or three... or a ton... in the Squadron 42 campaign.

We really like what we've seen from then, and so I think they're gonna do a fantastic job on upgrading and altering the variants just slightly. As for the lessons learned, the feedback, we learned that you guys are very interest in having modular ships - that was something that was a big take-away from that. You're very interested in being able to swap out the internal components of ships, so rather than just exterior components, being able to say, \"hey I want these crew quarters to be 'this' now,\" so that's something we've been exploring and hopefully we'll have more information on soon.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 01 (2014.12.08)", "source": "https://youtu.be/8Vjztd8mgjw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Beer4TheBeerGod", "published_at_timestamp": 1418080393}, {"objectID": "373678520", "question": "Will we be able to revive players that died, for example 5 or 10 minutes ago and we are near with our hospital ship to apply first aid, from permanent death?", "answer": "The idea with a med bay and a few other things, like for instance with the FPS stuff, in the PU if you die you'll be recovered out in space, taken down to a med-bay on a planet or station, and repaired/recovered to the best of their ability, so think Luke Skywalker in the med-tank in Jedi. You might be left a little worse for wear, like a bionic part, scars etc. So we don't have the traditional death and respawn mechanic as other FPS titles. The same is true in ship-boarding scenarios. Our combat will be more tactical, more considered. Of course, being the future, your ability to patch someone up is significantly better than today's world, so if someone gets shot and taken down, you might be able to drag him back to cover and patch him up, but there's a certain amount of damage that can be fixed by say, med-packs, but you might be able to do more with a med-bay, and even more with a hospital ship.

I don't think we'll have anything on the level of the Death Star where you can fly around and just blow planets up, but there certainly would be ones where you would go in with a group - so you would have to have some friends that would maybe take out the air cover and then take out the, you know, the anti-... I guess we don't say anti-air guns, but anti-space guns... \"anti-spaceship guns\" would be a good way of saying it... basically take out all the defensive perimeter, and then you would go in with a boarding ship and then try and takeover and control the space station.

We have different manufacturers, so we're going more in-fiction. So we have a Self-Land hangar, we've got an Aeroview hangar, and we've got a Revel & York hangar, and they're all actually going to be beautiful in PBR. So that'll be coming out down the road here, along with the asteroid hangar.We would plan to also have maybe some other models or stuff that would be developed over time, so who knows about something that could be underwater - that's actually kind of a cool idea - but it definitely isn't something we're working on right now. And I definitely think we're gonna have some more areas to put flare, decoration, ornaments, props inside the hangars, like bigger fish tanks or...

So we're really gonna push that and one of the other things we'll probably do with the hangars is it'll sort of be appropriate to the planet that you're based on or you're flying off, because if you're on a planet in the outer reaches of the galaxy that just has a colony on it, you're not going to have a big flashy hangar that maybe be on Terra, because they just haven't build out their infrastructure to that level.So anyway, I think you'll be excited by the new hangars, and I hope I answered that question as well as I could.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 32 (2014.08.04)", "source": "https://youtu.be/NM0DVz1VcvY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "SuojaKerroin", "published_at_timestamp": 1407189612}, {"objectID": "373683290", "question": "Please can you shed some light on the ship building process, and maybe help us understand why the ships that are seemingly complete, or very close to, cannot be placed in our hangars?", "answer": "Well, we do shed a fair amount of light on the ship building process, especially in Jump Point, which I'm assuming that you would read because you're a subscriber asking a question. But, I mean, to be less flippant about it, there's a huge amount of work that goes into building the ships, so to actually give you a good example, like if everyone has watched The Next Great Starship, and you saw how the gunship that won, that was essentially about a 5-month process from design to building it. And even that ship, that may have looked great in the final of The Next Great Starship, requires a couple more months of work to actually get it in the hangar, and then it would be more work beyond that to get it into spaceflight.Because beyond just building the ship in 3D and modelling and texturing it, and getting it basically into the engine - it has to be setup in a certain technical way for the engine, so the hierarchy of the sub-objects of the ship... animations have to be hooked up - they have to be hooked up to your default character's animations so when you go in you sit into the seats, you go through doorways, and do all that. So there's a huge amount of technical setup that comes with that. I would say that our ships take, probably from concept to final, the quickest we could probably do is something like 3 months, and some will take 6 months or longer - the bigger ships definitely. We still haven't finished the Idris corvette - we've been working on that for quite a while. That one is taking maybe a bit longer than it would normally take because we're using it as our first cap ship prototype, and so we've been going through several rounds of R&D, and quite how we're going to organize, how we're going to lay out the interiors. As you notice as part of the updates on, say the Idris corvette, once we've gone into laying out the interior, and moving it around, and figuring out how all of it will function for what we need on Squadron 42, we determined that we needed more room and space, and the ship itself grew. So there's a fair amount of iterative development that goes on the ships once you get it in. It's sort of like, \"oh, well this bit doesn't work. We have to change that,\" but it's by far the most complex thing that we build in all of the game. You can see it in the level of complexity and detail, animations, that you get into the ships.So that's sort of a high-level answer of why it takes so long, but believe me we're not holding back from putting them in the hangars if we can. We're trying to get them there as quickly as possible. There' just sooo many different items, and I would think that probably, maybe in a future \"Inside CIG\" or a Jump Point, we'll go into detail. We'll actually show you our multi steps of how ships are built from the concept, to the modelling, and all the rest of it. Because there's a lot more steps than was even shown on The Next Great Starship, and you'll see the love and passion that comes into them. So I know they're taking a while, but they'll worth it when they get there!", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 30.

So that's why one pilot will roll and then pitch if he wants to, I mean he could do his rudder and do this, but he'll do that 'cause he can actually do it quicker.So that would probably effect whether it would be pitch and yaw or pitch and roll. I mean right now the default is pitch and yaw with roll on the rudder pedals, but that may actually change to be more accurate to a real plane which would probably be pitch and roll on the joystick and then yaw on the rudder pedals.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 01 (2013.12.06)", "source": "https://youtu.be/QACEabB_8lA", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Herne", "published_at_timestamp": 1391813631}, {"objectID": "1264207001", "question": " I read somewhere that the Galaxy Server is currently supporting up to 45,000 players can be scaled in millions if the need be. This is a number that has been previously unheard of. The question that I want to ask is what are you doing to make sure to avoid outages and other issues? There will be literally millions who will try and log in at the same time.", "answer": "The Galaxy Server isn\u2019t really a Galaxy Sever. It\u2019s a cluster actually and it works in conjunction with what we call instance servers. It\u2019s the instance servers are the ones that are actually talking to the clients of the people playing and taking care of the load in space when people see other or fight with other. You\u2019re not going to be able to have 25,000 or a million in the same place in the same area but the universe cluster tracks everyone and can track millions of people if necessary, and it\u2019s doing  some dynamic match-making on the fly.<br/><br/>It\u2019s basically seeing that \u201cthis person and this person have entered the same area\u201d so let me spin up an instance server in that instance and hand off these people to that server. The instance server will then take care of the job of communicating between the two people so they can get up to each other\u2019s position and see other. That\u2019s kind of what the universe cluster does.<br/><br/>The universe cluster is really more of a match-making system what player you\u2019ve got, what ships you\u2019ve got, where you are in the galaxy and then it\u2019s constantly match-making people based on where they are, what their allegiances are, what their ping is\u2026all those kind of things and then puts them together with other players which are in the same area. It then hands them off to a local instance server.", "title": "Star Citizen Interview: Chris Roberts On Building A Space Simulator For The Ages", "source": "https://gamingbolt.com/star-citizen-interview-chris-roberts-on-building-a-space-simulator-for-the-ages", "type": "article", "user": "Ravi Sinha", "published_at_timestamp": 1391558400}]
