To explain I'll need to revisit some old ground.<br/>At its simplest, an object container is a designer created collection of entities that are always streamed together. The designer sets various properties on the entities and exports the object container from our editor tool. These properties include the type of an entity, how it connects to other entities in the OC, physical properties, collision mesh, and information about various asset types such as geometry, materials, animation, audio and so on. One of the properties an entity has is whether it \"hosts\" a zone or not. One final thing to know about OCs is that they each have a single root entity that contains all the other entities and assets in the OC. That entity is literally the OC entity.<br/>A zone is a physical space in which other entities can be present and move around without being physically attached to the \"zone host\" entity. A well-known fact about our zone system is that zones can be nested inside other zones.<br/>Recap done :)<br/>The missing bit of information is that when our designers need to add a zone they will often add the zone host property to the OC entity itself. Designers aren't forced to build things this way but it's such a common pattern that devs will often find themselves using the terms zone and OC almost interchangeably as a kind of shorthand. The problem with doing a presentation is that it's hard not to slip into using a less precise shorthand that we otherwise use every day without thinking about it.<br/>In that demo there were 3 OCs corresponding to the purple, green, and red areas in the map. The root entity for each of those OCs was also a zone host. So 3 OCs each with their own zone. We assigned authority over each OC to a different server. When an entity crossed from one zone to another it became a child of a different zone host from a different OC. Because the entity was now authoritative on a different server to the zone it was in that triggered an authority transition so it became authoritative on the same server. But it doesn't have to work that way. We just chose to set it up that way for the demo to make things a little easier to visualize and explain.

He brings up an example that CR has referred to previously this year: the \"Target Box\" which often just sits there saying \"No Target\", saying that if you don't have a target, why don't they just not have the box there at all. Typically that extends across all UIs too, such as the MFDs, where if you don't need to view something at that time, it can disappear out of view and reappear when they're needed, i.e. being more contextual. Simon adds that as they've been developing, they've been adding more and more things, so now they can take a step back and figure out what they want to show and how best to do that. They refer to the Chat box as an example of how it's almost constantly overlapping other UI elements when really it needs its own space on the screen, which Zane says is because the Chat box and the Ship UIs are on two different contexts, so they don't know about each other's sizes. He mentions how they're reworking the MFDs right now, creating a whole new system that's much more systemic, where it has a grid system \"where everything kind of fits into each other and you can create different sizes of widgets\", and suggests that that's probably how it'd be when they revamp the rest of the UI too. They want to be able to not have information repeated, such as being on the helmet visor as well as being on an MFD, as well as Players then being able to specify what information/HUD element they want on their visor. This requires building the foundation first into the overall design, which is something they're spending a lot of time working on right now as the tech is being developed in parallel. So they're building the tools to help them as developers to make really good UI, and then when that's done they can put the good UI into the game for everyone to see and use it, and hopefully to give feedback on it.

So not just for quantum drive but maybe even just traveling in normal like SCM or cruise speeds and then you can sort of leave the helm and walk around. Then of course if your ship is going to hit something whether it's in quantum drive or regular space mode, it would pull you out, it would basically stop sort of like one of those auto sensing brake systems.<br /><br />TZ: This kinda segues into the whole crew functionalities where not only can you go off and do something but you actually have a navigator, you can turn over control of the ship to him and basically give him some basic high level commands. In other words, I\u2019m in convention travel I say go over there, it\u2019s five minutes of flight, I\u2019m going to check on my cargo or I\u2019m going to affect repairs in engineering because I just took some damage and I can give him some basic instructions. What do you do if we come under fire? Do you stop, do you basically try to quickly escape, do you take evasive maneuvers. This kind of goes back to what we were talking about on one of the previous segments to where you'll be able to control your crew but at a very high, very macro level. We\u2019re not going to turn it into this micromanagement game, but if you\u2019ve actually made the investment, you\u2019ve got another pilot, you\u2019ve actually paid for somebody who\u2019s got a significant level of experience\u2026 then you\u2019re all the way back in engineering, it\u2019s going to take you 60 seconds to get to the bridge, he needs to do something to not make you a sitting duck for the pirates you just ran across.<br /><br />CR: So the bottom line is, if it\u2019s just you solo, you do the autopilot. It\u2019s simple point A to point B, will stop you so you don\u2019t hit anything but if you have crew and you have some\u2026 tell him to take the helm and you go to the back to fix the engine, that crew can operate at a higher level like they can stop but evade fire or try to escape the area or do something while you\u2019re heading back to take the helm.<br /><br />TZ: Which is interesting too cause that doesn\u2019t really involve any new coding on our side because we already got NPCs that know how to pilot spacecraft.

The last one he was okay on everything. So the proportions on the Cutlass look more like the concept now.<br /><br />The interaction with the fans really recharges the team. Barcitizens, events, everything\u2026 seeing what the fans think and how they react is great for all the team. It\u2019s what Josh likes as well. Fans give lots of good feedback, and answering fans questions is great. The game industry is normally so secretive, CIG is awesome because the devs are allowed to talk to people. It\u2019s why Tyler says \u2018everything is subject to change\u2019, because Josh says they want to have less wood trim, but it\u2019s all just \u2018where their heads are at\u2019, things change over time. It\u2019s what Bryan said back in the day early in Wingman\u2019s Hangar. People who aren\u2019t in the game industry; this is a great look at what goes on behind the scenes. When you start a game, there\u2019s a lot you want to do that over the course of the years change. Scope changes, you figure out what you can and can\u2019t do, and that\u2019s what CIG are doing now. Somethings work, some don\u2019t, etc\u2026<br />It\u2019s one of the great things. They go back and forth not only internally, but with the backers as well. One of the things they\u2019ve started doing is blocking out time for developers to go into the forums and interact with people. Check the forums, they\u2019ve been pretty active lately. Communicating with the public is just as important for CIG as communicating in-house. Fans help steer things in cool directions. They try to be mindful of what it is people are asking about ships. Though they know they can\u2019t please everyone. No ship can have everything. You want specialised rolls for ships. Tons of good ideas.

I have a Vanguard and while my job will be piloting, what will my gunner have to do for long flights when he is not needed in the turret?", "answer": "Well, I guess it sort of depends on how long you are considering the transiting is, but you are aboard the ship so I guess he can move around and stand behind you and say, \"Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?\"I don't know whether ultimately we'll give you like a little virtual chess game that you can play like Star Wars' Millennium Falcon.  We'll probably do some goofy things like that on board the ships.The idea is that you won't be sitting in quantum travel very long because the things where you would spend the most time would be quantum travel when you're doing the jump, that would typically be a shorter period of time than if you were going from one side of a solar system to another solar system.We haven't 100% determined what our ratio of scales are in terms of being 100% accurate to a solar system scale or being some portion of that.  Like, we've been discussing things like perhaps 3 hours of gameplay would represent one full day cycle in the solar system which would &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; potentially we'd say, \"Okay, well maybe we want to have everything be 1/8th scale.\"  I don't know.  So, we haven't quite figured that out but the idea would be that obviously it takes you real time to do the quantum which you are doing at some fraction of the speed of light per our fiction and you can't shortcut it because it is a multiplayer game so you can't time dilate the way you can in a singleplayer game where you can just sort of fade down to black and fade up and an hour has passed.  But we also don't want to make so you just sit there you're in quantum drive forever and it's really boring.  So, we're sort of juggling and that's kind of where the scale comes in.  The difference between absolutely 100% accurate &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; because even if you're 100% accurate, traveling at 0.2 the speed of light, it would still take you quite a long time to get somewhere like Pluto and you wouldn't want to commit that much time, hours of sitting at quantum drive, to go that distance but maybe you would commit 10 minutes.  I don't know.  So, we're sort of playing with that to see.We don't want to make it so long that you would get bored but we do want to make it take a bit of time, so obviously if you want to go from a long distance haul to a short distance haul there is a difference in time and commitment because it's sort of your reward for... you know, if I'm taking goods from this planet to this planet, well I should get paid more if I'm taking it to THIS planet because I've gotta go twice as far and therefore it takes twice as long.  So, we're still juggling with that but on the long flight basis, you know, I think we would &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; I don't know... that's the whole point of flying with a buddy!  Entertain each other with chatter when you go so it won't be such a solitary experience.  We're going to try to make it so it's not like strenuously long.

It's a big project in a big organization, and there are a lot of voices that need to be heard to make sure that the game is ready to go out.Travis Day: Yeah.DV: A kinda nice thing here - we've got different stratifications on who oversees what, where you've got Alex who oversees everything on a global level, and you've got me down at the bottom who just sees little small side-projects, or smaller scope of projects, and Travis is kind of right in the middle.TD: Mmhmm.

Actually something you said that's a really good point, cause a lot people have this idea that producers are like taskmasters, and that could not be farther from the truth. It's like, yes, we deal a lot with task, but the interest is not, \"Hey you! Where are you at? Why aren't you doing this?!\", it's more like, \"Hey!

As you fire it up you basically are entering the dogfight mode so the hangar, holodeck style, disappears, and then you're in space, but it's really sort of a holodeck version of space.

So yeah, the Cutlass is actually going to be the next ship that everyone is actually going to see in their hangar. The ship that we've actually been working on the longest outside of that is actually the Idris Corvette. But it's a really huge ship and we've been going through a little bit of a rearrange/redesign on the interior side to be able to fit the number of ships we want to fit on the hangar deck. I'm not quite sure what then next one is. We're doing the variants on the Freelancer and we're also going to be doing some stuff on the Caterpillar and stuff like that. So I guess it will be a horse race between those, we'll see what happens.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 04 (2014.01.10)", "source": "https://youtu.be/FsWDLHVYNHI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "anethema", "published_at_timestamp": 1389377198}, {"objectID": "1d06b288cedeb1_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Again if above is true, if a citizen buys gear higher than his tier, how will secured citizen space react to this? IE, if scanned by patrol you are told you have gear equipped you are not authorized to have. If say, you have gear thats 1 tier above yours, will the patrol let you off with a warning? If 2 tiers higher, will you pay a fine? If 3 or more tiers, will you have it confiscated? If you don't have citizenship at all, might it be confiscated regardless (unless you fight and run away to freedom) Obviously if you're freespace (no security), your free to do as you wish. How might this mechanic work?", "answer": "I don't think their will be a penalty for this. It's just going to cost you more if you've bought it on the black market. There could be some repercussions for having a Citizen Friend of Foe transmitter when you're not a Citizen or Pirate however.", "user": "bignick277", "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12grru/i_am_chris_roberts_creator_of_wing_commander/c6uz77i/", "published_at_timestamp": 1351771200, "title": "r/IAmA: Chris Roberts", "type": "reddit"}]
