These maximum-security facilities were reputed to be the most secure in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) and were used to house political dissidents opposed to the Messer regime. Following the fall of the Messers in 2792, the Governors Council of Charon III ordered that the prisons be torn down and published evidence of previously unproven atrocities committed against the prisoners by the former government. In the subsequent public uproar, Charon III voted to renounce its UEE recognition.</p><br/><h1>Foundation</h1><br/><p>Shortly after Livia Messer III ascended to Imperator in 2628, she presented a proposal to the Senate to build a special maximum-security prison under the sole jurisdiction of the Imperator in the sparsely populated state of Dellin on Charon III. The project would kickstart the struggling economy with new jobs and an influx of government funds. The Senate granted near-unanimous approval.</p><br/><p>The first prison, completed in 2630, injected enough money into the economy that the population of Charon III sharply rose. By the time Imperator Corsen Messer V ascended in 2643, the once-rural colony in Dellin had become an urbanized center of commerce based around Livia\u2019s prison. Corsen ordered the construction of more facilities in Dellin and its neighboring state Acheron after a meeting with the Governors Council of Charon III in 2644. The largest of these, Orville, became the central processing center for all new prisoners. The collective of facilities was named the Empire\u2019s Light Conversion Centers (ELCC). During this time, Charon III\u2019s economy boomed. In 2670, Corsen sent a decree to the Senate ordering the recognition of Charon III. A former Representative of Dellin, Gwen Czukay, was sworn in as the planet\u2019s first Senator and the world was officially recognized under its new name, Haros.</p><br/><h1>Life in the Prisons</h1><br/><p>The largest group of prisoners were political dissidents. These included deserters from the military, Xi\u2019an sympathizers, former members of the press, protestors, social organizers, violent agitators, and even politicians. Anyone who acted or spoke against the edicts of the Messer government was in danger of being imprisoned on Haros. Convictions weren\u2019t necessary; being arrested for a political crime was enough to put someone in Orville, ostensibly to await a fair trial. Many died there, waiting for hearings that were never granted. Contact was not allowed with the outside world.</p><br/><p>Prisoners were put to work producing components for the UEE military or low-cost goods to be used by public welfare programs. Their meals were bland but nutritionally complete, and medical care was available to those who took ill so that they could continue to work until they died of old age or exhaustion. When Astrid Messer VII ascended to Imperator in 2697, standards of living in the ELCCs, already poor, plummeted. Funds meant for prisoner welfare were redirected to military resources. Malnutrition, dehydration, exhaustion, and disease became the leading causes of death.</p><br/><p>Under Samuel Messer VIII, who ousted Astrid from power in 2701, a new decree set interment limits so that old-age prisoners would be killed to make room for new ones. The dead were interred in mass graves in the Dellin desert.</p><br/><p>Rumors about the deplorable conditions in the ELCCs began to spread among the people of Haros, though no hard evidence could be found. Any workers suspected of leaking information were themselves at risk of imprisonment and all civilian protesters were incarcerated or killed, eventually quelling any kind of organized protest against the prisons. In 2751, the military began testing bioweapons on segments of Orville\u2019s populace. Bodies buried in the desert leached chemicals and radiation into the already poor soil, fueling a new collective action among the populace of Haros. Though any dissent was brutally suppressed, protests increased in frequency for the following few decades.</p><br/><h1>Liberation</h1><br/><p>When news of Imperator Linton Messer XI\u2019s death in 2792 reached the populace of Haros, they stormed the prisons, liberating those inside. They arrested or killed any guards who hadn\u2019t fled and broke into offices previously sealed off to the public, recovering centuries of documentation on acts of torture, murder, and other atrocities conducted by those who ran and guarded the prisons. First-hand accounts from the formerly incarcerated were compiled and sent to media organizations across the UEE. Senator Constance Whittlefield of Haros was arrested on charges of fraud. In 2795, the planet voted to renounce their recognition of the UEE and revert to their former designation of Charon III.</p><br/><p>Even after the Messers were permanently ousted from power and a new, progressive government reformed under Imperator Erin Toi, Charon III refused to rejoin the UEE, citing their forced participation in crimes against Humanity as reason enough to permanently remain independent. The government then razed the prisons to the ground.

To explain I'll need to revisit some old ground.<br/>At its simplest, an object container is a designer created collection of entities that are always streamed together. The designer sets various properties on the entities and exports the object container from our editor tool. These properties include the type of an entity, how it connects to other entities in the OC, physical properties, collision mesh, and information about various asset types such as geometry, materials, animation, audio and so on. One of the properties an entity has is whether it \"hosts\" a zone or not. One final thing to know about OCs is that they each have a single root entity that contains all the other entities and assets in the OC. That entity is literally the OC entity.<br/>A zone is a physical space in which other entities can be present and move around without being physically attached to the \"zone host\" entity. A well-known fact about our zone system is that zones can be nested inside other zones.<br/>Recap done :)<br/>The missing bit of information is that when our designers need to add a zone they will often add the zone host property to the OC entity itself. Designers aren't forced to build things this way but it's such a common pattern that devs will often find themselves using the terms zone and OC almost interchangeably as a kind of shorthand. The problem with doing a presentation is that it's hard not to slip into using a less precise shorthand that we otherwise use every day without thinking about it.<br/>In that demo there were 3 OCs corresponding to the purple, green, and red areas in the map. The root entity for each of those OCs was also a zone host. So 3 OCs each with their own zone. We assigned authority over each OC to a different server. When an entity crossed from one zone to another it became a child of a different zone host from a different OC. Because the entity was now authoritative on a different server to the zone it was in that triggered an authority transition so it became authoritative on the same server. But it doesn't have to work that way. We just chose to set it up that way for the demo to make things a little easier to visualize and explain.

He brings up an example that CR has referred to previously this year: the \"Target Box\" which often just sits there saying \"No Target\", saying that if you don't have a target, why don't they just not have the box there at all. Typically that extends across all UIs too, such as the MFDs, where if you don't need to view something at that time, it can disappear out of view and reappear when they're needed, i.e. being more contextual. Simon adds that as they've been developing, they've been adding more and more things, so now they can take a step back and figure out what they want to show and how best to do that. They refer to the Chat box as an example of how it's almost constantly overlapping other UI elements when really it needs its own space on the screen, which Zane says is because the Chat box and the Ship UIs are on two different contexts, so they don't know about each other's sizes. He mentions how they're reworking the MFDs right now, creating a whole new system that's much more systemic, where it has a grid system \"where everything kind of fits into each other and you can create different sizes of widgets\", and suggests that that's probably how it'd be when they revamp the rest of the UI too. They want to be able to not have information repeated, such as being on the helmet visor as well as being on an MFD, as well as Players then being able to specify what information/HUD element they want on their visor. This requires building the foundation first into the overall design, which is something they're spending a lot of time working on right now as the tech is being developed in parallel. So they're building the tools to help them as developers to make really good UI, and then when that's done they can put the good UI into the game for everyone to see and use it, and hopefully to give feedback on it.

So, we were talking about this before, we were discussing you pry should be able to set an autopilot like singular point distance. So not just for quantum drive but maybe even just traveling in normal like SCM or cruise speeds and then you can sort of leave the helm and walk around. Then of course if your ship is going to hit something whether it's in quantum drive or regular space mode, it would pull you out, it would basically stop sort of like one of those auto sensing brake systems.<br /><br />TZ: This kinda segues into the whole crew functionalities where not only can you go off and do something but you actually have a navigator, you can turn over control of the ship to him and basically give him some basic high level commands. In other words, I\u2019m in convention travel I say go over there, it\u2019s five minutes of flight, I\u2019m going to check on my cargo or I\u2019m going to affect repairs in engineering because I just took some damage and I can give him some basic instructions. What do you do if we come under fire? Do you stop, do you basically try to quickly escape, do you take evasive maneuvers. This kind of goes back to what we were talking about on one of the previous segments to where you'll be able to control your crew but at a very high, very macro level. We\u2019re not going to turn it into this micromanagement game, but if you\u2019ve actually made the investment, you\u2019ve got another pilot, you\u2019ve actually paid for somebody who\u2019s got a significant level of experience\u2026 then you\u2019re all the way back in engineering, it\u2019s going to take you 60 seconds to get to the bridge, he needs to do something to not make you a sitting duck for the pirates you just ran across.<br /><br />CR: So the bottom line is, if it\u2019s just you solo, you do the autopilot. It\u2019s simple point A to point B, will stop you so you don\u2019t hit anything but if you have crew and you have some\u2026 tell him to take the helm and you go to the back to fix the engine, that crew can operate at a higher level like they can stop but evade fire or try to escape the area or do something while you\u2019re heading back to take the helm.<br /><br />TZ: Which is interesting too cause that doesn\u2019t really involve any new coding on our side because we already got NPCs that know how to pilot spacecraft.

Are we there yet? Are we there yet?\"I don't know whether ultimately we'll give you like a little virtual chess game that you can play like Star Wars' Millennium Falcon.  We'll probably do some goofy things like that on board the ships.The idea is that you won't be sitting in quantum travel very long because the things where you would spend the most time would be quantum travel when you're doing the jump, that would typically be a shorter period of time than if you were going from one side of a solar system to another solar system.We haven't 100% determined what our ratio of scales are in terms of being 100% accurate to a solar system scale or being some portion of that.  Like, we've been discussing things like perhaps 3 hours of gameplay would represent one full day cycle in the solar system which would &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; potentially we'd say, \"Okay, well maybe we want to have everything be 1/8th scale.\"  I don't know.  So, we haven't quite figured that out but the idea would be that obviously it takes you real time to do the quantum which you are doing at some fraction of the speed of light per our fiction and you can't shortcut it because it is a multiplayer game so you can't time dilate the way you can in a singleplayer game where you can just sort of fade down to black and fade up and an hour has passed.  But we also don't want to make so you just sit there you're in quantum drive forever and it's really boring.  So, we're sort of juggling and that's kind of where the scale comes in.  The difference between absolutely 100% accurate &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; because even if you're 100% accurate, traveling at 0.2 the speed of light, it would still take you quite a long time to get somewhere like Pluto and you wouldn't want to commit that much time, hours of sitting at quantum drive, to go that distance but maybe you would commit 10 minutes.  I don't know.  So, we're sort of playing with that to see.We don't want to make it so long that you would get bored but we do want to make it take a bit of time, so obviously if you want to go from a long distance haul to a short distance haul there is a difference in time and commitment because it's sort of your reward for... you know, if I'm taking goods from this planet to this planet, well I should get paid more if I'm taking it to THIS planet because I've gotta go twice as far and therefore it takes twice as long.  So, we're still juggling with that but on the long flight basis, you know, I think we would &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; I don't know... that's the whole point of flying with a buddy!

It's not completely symmetrical, it still has asymmetrical elements to it, and the idea is that it can bloom out into this sort of, transmission array, and in between it looks a bit sleeker.

Aside from CR, are you the guys who give the \"green light\" for a release?", "answer": "Darian Vorlick: We've got our executive producer here, who can kinda give a better definition of that...Alex Mayberry: Sure. Producers are certainly project managers - that's part of our job. I don't know that we use whips and bullhorns! But we do help set deadlines. We partner with all of our developers to make sure that they know what they need to do, they know when it needs to be done by, and that there's nothing stopping them from doing those things. When it comes to a green light process, ultimately at the end of the day it's Chris Roberts who decides whether we release something, but we all take part in it. It's a big project in a big organization, and there are a lot of voices that need to be heard to make sure that the game is ready to go out.Travis Day: Yeah.DV: A kinda nice thing here - we've got different stratifications on who oversees what, where you've got Alex who oversees everything on a global level, and you've got me down at the bottom who just sees little small side-projects, or smaller scope of projects, and Travis is kind of right in the middle.TD: Mmhmm. Yeah, how apropos. [Gesturing with arms that he is sitting in the middle of the trio]DV: We're like one of those Russian dolls that you can stack them on top of each other, or within...TD: Yeah, nesting dolls.DV: Nesting - thank you!AM: Yeah, and you know, it's not just about whether something's ready for release - we also make sure that if we're crunching people are fed, that if we're travelling people have their itineraries, and their flights booked, and their hotels booked, so we try to make sure that everybody has their needs met, and that's also part of the job.TD: Yeah, definitely. Actually something you said that's a really good point, cause a lot people have this idea that producers are like taskmasters, and that could not be farther from the truth. It's like, yes, we deal a lot with task, but the interest is not, \"Hey you! Where are you at? Why aren't you doing this?!\", it's more like, \"Hey! Here, look - I'm organizing your life, I'm organizing your day-to-day. This all, you know, it gives you clarity,\" and it's really a partnership.AM: Yeah, and our responsibility really is to get things done, but we're not the ones who do them. And so, it's really not effective to run around with whips and bullhorns because that doesn't really inspire people to do great work. Instead, we need to partner with them and make sure that they know they can count on us to line everything up that they need.DV: What we can do to support them and make sure they can get their stuff done.AM: Right.TD: I think it was you [Alex] that said, \"if you have a room full of producers then there's probably not a lot getting done in game development.\"AM: I have said that many times!", "published_at": "2015-01-12", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 03 (2015.01.12)", "source": "https://youtu.be/EcnGeEBt3Go", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "WALL-Eminus", "published_at_timestamp": 1421103656}, {"objectID": "373677580", "question": "Will a coms officer be able to scan for and listen to other players' / NPCs' ship to ship or EVA communications over various frequencies?

So when we show that and reveal it later this year, you'll see a lot of that. But we're also going to have some level of aging for the characters, so as you get older, we'll want them to feel like they get older. The same way that we want ships to have wear and tear.So we'll have that. I don't know about the cleaning, the grubby thing, but I kind of like it as an idea, it's kind of cool.It all would probably be based on the same system because we sort of have a blend system that you set up the pristine thing, and then you have the really dirty, worn thing, and then you just blend between them on a scale of 0 to 1. It actually would probably be not that difficult to do, it would be kind of along the same lines as the ships.I will take that under advisement, because we're already setting it up for the aging and some of the other stuff. you never know, you could be an unwashed pirate, or you could go and scrub yourself up in a shower.", "published_at": "2014-05-05", "title": "10 for the Chairman Episode 19.

We haven't decided whether you'll be able to pop out to see yourself in third person or not, because sometimes the character's really cool to look at, but in general it's designed as a first person game.Crysis is a first person game, that's the engine that we've built on, and our team that's working on the first person side of the game has a background in first person shooters, really inspired by Unreal Tournament and all of that stuff. But we're not gonna be all quick and arcadey like some of the old style Unreal Tournament and Quake style shooters because of our death mechanic.Our first person combat is slightly more realistic and tactical, and there's more at stake.We're gonna be announcing and sharing more about that probably in, not the next month, but after the dogfighting, we're gonna start to share that, and one of the additions onto the Dogfighting Module will be the boarding.So Dogfighting v1 will be the single seater ships, Dogfigthing v2 will be the multi-crew ships, then we'll move on to boarding, and it will all get tied together which will be pretty cool.", "published_at": "2014-03-10", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 11 (2014.03.10)", "source": "https://youtu.be/ItuiYF_lRGc", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Uncle Mo", "published_at_timestamp": 1394491510}, {"objectID": "373685680", "question": "How entering dogfight will be handled? Will you start your ship in your hangar in an arena or spawn magically in space?", "answer": "Ok, so I kind of answered this on a previous subscriber question in last week's show. Essentially you start in your hangar, the entrance point to the game is your hangar at the moment, and you'll be able to adjust your load-out on the holotable. Then you climb into the cockpit of your ship and then you fire it up. As you fire it up you basically are entering the dogfight mode so the hangar, holodeck style, disappears, and then you're in space, but it's really sort of a holodeck version of space. That's how you fly there, when you finish it, you come back into your hangar.

So yeah, the Cutlass is actually going to be the next ship that everyone is actually going to see in their hangar. The ship that we've actually been working on the longest outside of that is actually the Idris Corvette. But it's a really huge ship and we've been going through a little bit of a rearrange/redesign on the interior side to be able to fit the number of ships we want to fit on the hangar deck. I'm not quite sure what then next one is. We're doing the variants on the Freelancer and we're also going to be doing some stuff on the Caterpillar and stuff like that.
