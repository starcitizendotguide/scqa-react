It has a fleshy, violet, trumpet-shaped, fuzz-covered stem that amplifies a natural sound created by the expansion and contraction of the hyphae as water passes through it. Because the mushroom is easily grown on spacecraft, it became popular as an on-board plant shortly after its commercial debut in 2925.</p><br/><h1>DEVELOPMENT</h1><br/><p>In 2918, genetics graduate students Mauveine Senae and Phil Ektos started a project to create an edible version of the fast-growing purple chimney mushroom, a toxic fungus indigenous to Reisse (Rhetor III). Dr. Yuki Hexa, Senae\u2019s advisor, joined the project after Senae and Ektos presented their early results: a mushroom with a deeper funnel shape and slightly less toxicity. As the team made further modifications to the mushroom\u2019s genetic code, the toxicity failed to fall to levels safe for Human consumption, but the divot in its stem deepened. One night, Ektos heard a strange tone in the lab, and traced it to the latest generation of mushrooms.</p><br/><p>The team agreed to reframe their project to bring out the new audio qualities of the mushroom. By the end of 2920, they had developed a stable breeding population of mushrooms that produced varying tones depending on their size. Senae created a personal garden of the mushrooms in her dorm room, arranged so they resembled performers on a tiny stage. Hexa suggested the name \"opera mushroom\" after seeing this display. In early 2921, Ektos and Senae submitted their work on the opera mushroom to their dissertation committees and were awarded doctorates.</p><br/><h1>LIFECYCLE</h1><br/><p>After a four-week growing period, the constant motion of water through the mature mushroom causes ballistospores to slowly eject from the trumpet. After these spores fall onto a suitable substrate, they take root into a mycelium from which the mushrooms emerge. More and more mushrooms grow as the mycelium spreads underground, sometimes resulting in a widening ring-like pattern. Places where opera mushrooms grow can often be heard before they are seen.</p><br/><h1>COMMERCIAL DEBUT</h1><br/><p>Samples of the opera mushroom were made available to plant nurseries on Reisse in 2925. Thanks to its novelty and fast growth cycles, the fungus was an instant hit. It became a popular houseplant, especially for long-haul spacefarers in need of something low-maintenance to decorate their holds. Skilled gardeners can grow mushrooms in arrangements that produce harmonizing tones. </p><br/><p>In 2926, a wild, self-sustaining population of opera mushrooms was discovered 11 kilometers from the UR Genetics lab. The mushrooms continue to grow in the wild on Reisse today.

I think that would probably be the idea. The idea with the Esperia stuff is they've taken captured, real Vanduul ships and fabricated, as close as possible, the parts for these whatever you want to call them, sort of \"red flag\", versions that you are going to fly and fight against. And so you should be able to use those parts to interchange. I don't know whether there'll be a difference or a bonus between ... if you repair your captured Scythe with human parts if it's quite the same as getting captured Vanduul parts. We haven't made a decision on that.

How will we be able to help them increase that experience?", "answer": "So yes NPCs absolutely will.They will be treated much more like you would have a character in a traditional RPG game: they'll have skill levels; they'll probably have different traits, whether it's strength or loyalty, dexterity or intelligence; and skill with certain things, like skill in being gunner or skill in being a pilot.We'll generate them at different levels: rookie, starting out not so good is obviously much cheaper to hire than the veteran that super bad ass at a bunch of stuff, so you can also get what you pay for in terms of hiring your NPCs. But if you start with someone that isn't as experienced, the more you take them into battles and stuff they'll level up and they'll get better and more experienced just like people do in real life. So we do do these stats for the NPCs because we need to track how they get better and everything; we're just not doing it for the player because we want the player to be you doing it and your skills, so it's you getting better playing the game, not necessarily just leveling up stuff.So that'll be there. You'll get some access to it. I'm not sure we'll expose the individual background stats we track but you'll get an idea of whether they are experienced: veteran or rookie and stuff like that.

I believe the answer is going to be that you can. Obviously our first iteration of jump points will be just handling a single ship, because, as we build the technology, that seems like a logical place to start. Down the road, I do know that, there's a concept of a stargate wormhole for example, where you cruise through and arrive at your destination, I think our concept of a wormhole or jump point is much more in line with having something that's much more of a physical space, so something that you can actually traverse, and it has a finite distance and there are obstacles, as we saw in the SXSW previews we did for the jump points, so I believe the natural extension of that is yes, we'll start with one ship, and then I yes, you'll have multiple ships travelling through simultaneously. Whether or not you'll be able to fire weapons at each other, board each other, that simply hasn't been fleshed out yet, because there's no jump points yet, but once we have that and we determine what's fun, it'd suck to go into a jump point and have that not be fun, but as we build out the game we'll know more, but I know that's something that Chris would like to do, there's a lot of designers that would like to do, it's just something we'll have to build out to determine whether it's good for the game.Ricky Jutley: I think as like a base iteration, the first element would be making sure you can actually traverse and end up at some destinationTD: Yeah, getting through it is a good step pointRJ: Yeah, lets get that right as well.

There will be some kind of special style cargo, like contraband or smuggled goods, where you might have to find a buyer for that particular item rather than just going through a vanilla commodities broker. Most of the time it'll be handled in the background, and you'll negotiate prices/amounts using your manifest with the local commodities broker, they'll buy it then offload it from your ship. But there will be some places where you land where there might not be big infrastructure, so you might have to load some cargo into, say, your rover and take that to a camp a few kilometres away, or maybe deliver some cargo to a lone explorer out there somewhere. Most of the big trading stuff will be done in a higher level way, which is kind of how it'd be done in real life, we thought that always unloading it manually could get pretty boring.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 50 (2015.01.19)", "source": "https://youtu.be/lzPbXC-NOvY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Sheppard22", "published_at_timestamp": 1421708409}, {"objectID": "373683550", "question": "Is it possible for a human to gain citizenship in one of the alien civilizations, or vice versa?

One, trying to make the universe and the system feel as realistic as possible, also protecting people from those abusing the system for outside reasons, like gold farmers and stuff.So we were thinking that there would be several levels. We'll probably let you trade between players. There will be some level in most of the cases of a tax in trade between players. Very similar to if I right now want to give my car to someone, I would have to sign my title over to them, so there's a cost in signing the title over, and we will have that type of mechanic in a lot of the trades.I don't know on the player to player sales, we definitely want players to be able to sell to other players, so we're going to allow that. Depending on where you sell it, you'll obviously have to pay the taxes to your local place for selling. Just like you would have to pay sales tax if you're selling to other people here like where I am right now in California.I do want players to go and collect really cool things in parts of the galaxy and take them to other parts and sell them to players for convenience. I think we'll use the same system that we're talking about for the mission ratings where both the seller and the buyer can rate each other, whether you're a good seller or whether you're a good buyer, and so obviously if someone has a good reseller rating, then you feel more comfortable than if they don't.And of course buying from NPCs will probably be the safest of all the things that you can do... So I do think to a certain extent, you may or may not have to be suspicious of other players, although when a player's selling to you it's not quite the same as it is in the real world here. If you were gonna buy and sell it in our game, you probably would have to be face to face with that character and once you sell it, the item's gonna transfer.It's not the same as purchase something, give someone my credit card online here, and then the goods never show up, because we handle the brokering of the system, so we'll make it so people can't scam each other as far as that stuff goes.So I think it's gonna be better than real life, but we do want to keep a little element of real life in there where there could be the potential of some players to be more dishonest or try and screw other players over, and there's a pro and con to that, just to make the game more interesting.Maybe that's the sort of stuff that can only happen in the unregulated border worlds, wherein you couldn't do that in the UEE say on Earth or on Terra because on Terra, you would have to go through an official broker, and then you can't cheat in that case. But maybe you don't need the broker out on an outlaw planet. You may do that transaction 'cause it's gonna cost you less, 'cause it doesn't have the same taxes and fees, but then the risk is, maybe someone screws you over.That's kind of the risk/reward that we're thinking about playing with, and we want to build that into the game, which I think will make it pretty interesting.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 20.

Transient Jump Points are free for all experiences, you align, tune and the activate the Jump Point and then are pulled in.</p><br/><p>As you can see from Transient Jump Points. The inclusion of ATC in the permanent Jump Points flow is not a technical requirement needed for transitioning players between systems or anything like that. They are part of the flow solely for gameplay reasons. The ATC exists here for fairness to all jumpers, a fairness intentionally omitted in the Transient flow.  The permanent Jump Points will likely be busy high volume routes. We don't want slower ships being trumped to jump by faster ships all the time, we also want to make sure we protect those ships who have waited and determine who is at fault for doing something obstructive, ATC will help us do this.</p><br/><p>Additionally the ATC exists to imply and actually impose some level of decision making on those who choose to skirt the law or play outright criminally.   Those player may instead choose or have to seek out Transient Jump Points to make their journeys in order to avoid this extra scrutiny.</p><br/><p>I also want to clarify how ATC also makes sense as part of a bigger picture.  Think of Permanent Jump Points as known controlled border checkpoints between systems. If you were the UEE authority in charge of protecting a system like Stanton from lawless systems that you know you border with, like Pyro, would you operate an open borders with them? I don't think you would, you'd find a way to control it.</p><br/><p>In this sense ATC is being used as the gate keeper. How does it do that I see you all asking. If ATC hasn't granted you permission to jump yet then by default they actively jam jump drives from tuning. Once you have permission to jump they selectively choose to stop jamming your jump drive, which then lets you tune and jump, simple.</p><br/><p>Edit:</p><p>I need to clarify this statement about \"shooting of the Jump Point\" as the way I have worded this before was incorrect of the facts.</p><br/><p>There is no error in the footage in the ISC episode, and what you see is not a gun shooting the jump point to activate it. This is the VFX we have at this moment in time for the activation step and what you see is how it functions in the game at this moment in time. After activation the ripple wave completes across the ship and then launches as a projectile from the front of the ship. At no point do we show the projectile coming from a gun. It didn't happen.  We haven't added combat to opening a Jump Point.</p><br/><p>That there are guns incidentally located at the front of the ship that was used is unfortunate. There are guns on a fair number of vehicles. In hindsight we could have used a different ship with less weaponry, and we'll note that for any revisitation, but it doesn't change that we do NOT show the projectile coming from a gun. We show it working EXACTLY how we were able to get it to work on a Vanguard at this moment in time.</p><br/><p>Thanks for reading,</p><br/><p>Edward Fuller, Senior Principal System Designer </p>", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/3/thread/some-clarity-on-jump-points", "published_at_timestamp": 1723260567, "title": "Some clarity on Jump Points", "type": "post"}]
