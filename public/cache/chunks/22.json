Part of it also about how we parse out that information, but yes it there will probably be an update.Ben Lesnick: I thought the Writers Guide was a great, especially earlier on where we didn't have the game for people to play, but you could already imagine yourself in the universe and you could start creating your own fiction in it.DH: Yeah it was fun too also having the aspects of it that we started doing with the Lore Builder where there the areas we haven't quite figured and so we got to turn to the community and I remember particularly we generated a lot of bands that did music and beer and...BL: Star Citizen, full of bands and beer.DH: [Laughs]BL: Now I always like looking back on a show and it'll always be like 20 and 30 years later where we're like \"Oh there's the Star Trek writers bible\" and it's cool that we just put it out for everybody early on.DH: Yeah, actually the Star Trek Next Generation bible is, I have it in my office actually if you haven't read it, you should check it out.BL: One of my favourite things in the world is the licensed tie in fiction that comes very, very early, like they kicked off some writer writing the first couple novels before they shot the first episode.

The idea with the Esperia stuff is they've taken captured, real Vanduul ships and fabricated, as close as possible, the parts for these whatever you want to call them, sort of \"red flag\", versions that you are going to fly and fight against. And so you should be able to use those parts to interchange. I don't know whether there'll be a difference or a bonus between ... if you repair your captured Scythe with human parts if it's quite the same as getting captured Vanduul parts.

But if you start with someone that isn't as experienced, the more you take them into battles and stuff they'll level up and they'll get better and more experienced just like people do in real life. So we do do these stats for the NPCs because we need to track how they get better and everything; we're just not doing it for the player because we want the player to be you doing it and your skills, so it's you getting better playing the game, not necessarily just leveling up stuff.So that'll be there. You'll get some access to it. I'm not sure we'll expose the individual background stats we track but you'll get an idea of whether they are experienced: veteran or rookie and stuff like that.

So having the non-combat stuff to mount on your ship, absolutely. Active defense stuff...Calix Reneau: Yeah, we've sorta talked about a little bit of it. Example might be, in the shield post some time ago we went over much more active shield roles, like directing a unified face or some such thing which could be an active... anything you plug into a gun mount we're generally going to want that to be an active part of your ship.

I believe the answer is going to be that you can. Obviously our first iteration of jump points will be just handling a single ship, because, as we build the technology, that seems like a logical place to start. Down the road, I do know that, there's a concept of a stargate wormhole for example, where you cruise through and arrive at your destination, I think our concept of a wormhole or jump point is much more in line with having something that's much more of a physical space, so something that you can actually traverse, and it has a finite distance and there are obstacles, as we saw in the SXSW previews we did for the jump points, so I believe the natural extension of that is yes, we'll start with one ship, and then I yes, you'll have multiple ships travelling through simultaneously. Whether or not you'll be able to fire weapons at each other, board each other, that simply hasn't been fleshed out yet, because there's no jump points yet, but once we have that and we determine what's fun, it'd suck to go into a jump point and have that not be fun, but as we build out the game we'll know more, but I know that's something that Chris would like to do, there's a lot of designers that would like to do, it's just something we'll have to build out to determine whether it's good for the game.Ricky Jutley: I think as like a base iteration, the first element would be making sure you can actually traverse and end up at some destinationTD: Yeah, getting through it is a good step pointRJ: Yeah, lets get that right as well.

Most of the time it'll be handled in the background, and you'll negotiate prices/amounts using your manifest with the local commodities broker, they'll buy it then offload it from your ship. But there will be some places where you land where there might not be big infrastructure, so you might have to load some cargo into, say, your rover and take that to a camp a few kilometres away, or maybe deliver some cargo to a lone explorer out there somewhere. Most of the big trading stuff will be done in a higher level way, which is kind of how it'd be done in real life, we thought that always unloading it manually could get pretty boring.", "published_at": "2015-01-19", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 50 (2015.01.19)", "source": "https://youtu.be/lzPbXC-NOvY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Sheppard22", "published_at_timestamp": 1421708409}, {"objectID": "373683550", "question": "Is it possible for a human to gain citizenship in one of the alien civilizations, or vice versa?

Those are sort of areas of expansions that we're thinking once the game is up and running we would concentrate on and eventually allow you to actually even play a different race, rather than just the human race. So at the beginning we probably wouldn't have those abilities but as the game progresses, and everyone's having a good time, and hopefully we're doing well, those will be the kinds of things that we will be adding down the road. Cos it would be pretty cool.You will definitely see Tevarin around the UEE universe. You'll see some Banu and you'll see some Xi'An, but they will be more in NPC capacity and for trading with.

One, trying to make the universe and the system feel as realistic as possible, also protecting people from those abusing the system for outside reasons, like gold farmers and stuff.So we were thinking that there would be several levels. We'll probably let you trade between players. There will be some level in most of the cases of a tax in trade between players. Very similar to if I right now want to give my car to someone, I would have to sign my title over to them, so there's a cost in signing the title over, and we will have that type of mechanic in a lot of the trades.I don't know on the player to player sales, we definitely want players to be able to sell to other players, so we're going to allow that. Depending on where you sell it, you'll obviously have to pay the taxes to your local place for selling. Just like you would have to pay sales tax if you're selling to other people here like where I am right now in California.I do want players to go and collect really cool things in parts of the galaxy and take them to other parts and sell them to players for convenience. I think we'll use the same system that we're talking about for the mission ratings where both the seller and the buyer can rate each other, whether you're a good seller or whether you're a good buyer, and so obviously if someone has a good reseller rating, then you feel more comfortable than if they don't.And of course buying from NPCs will probably be the safest of all the things that you can do... So I do think to a certain extent, you may or may not have to be suspicious of other players, although when a player's selling to you it's not quite the same as it is in the real world here. If you were gonna buy and sell it in our game, you probably would have to be face to face with that character and once you sell it, the item's gonna transfer.It's not the same as purchase something, give someone my credit card online here, and then the goods never show up, because we handle the brokering of the system, so we'll make it so people can't scam each other as far as that stuff goes.So I think it's gonna be better than real life, but we do want to keep a little element of real life in there where there could be the potential of some players to be more dishonest or try and screw other players over, and there's a pro and con to that, just to make the game more interesting.Maybe that's the sort of stuff that can only happen in the unregulated border worlds, wherein you couldn't do that in the UEE say on Earth or on Terra because on Terra, you would have to go through an official broker, and then you can't cheat in that case. But maybe you don't need the broker out on an outlaw planet. You may do that transaction 'cause it's gonna cost you less, 'cause it doesn't have the same taxes and fees, but then the risk is, maybe someone screws you over.That's kind of the risk/reward that we're thinking about playing with, and we want to build that into the game, which I think will make it pretty interesting.", "published_at": "2014-05-12", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 20.
