It has a fleshy, violet, trumpet-shaped, fuzz-covered stem that amplifies a natural sound created by the expansion and contraction of the hyphae as water passes through it. Because the mushroom is easily grown on spacecraft, it became popular as an on-board plant shortly after its commercial debut in 2925.</p><br/><h1>DEVELOPMENT</h1><br/><p>In 2918, genetics graduate students Mauveine Senae and Phil Ektos started a project to create an edible version of the fast-growing purple chimney mushroom, a toxic fungus indigenous to Reisse (Rhetor III). Dr. Yuki Hexa, Senae\u2019s advisor, joined the project after Senae and Ektos presented their early results: a mushroom with a deeper funnel shape and slightly less toxicity. As the team made further modifications to the mushroom\u2019s genetic code, the toxicity failed to fall to levels safe for Human consumption, but the divot in its stem deepened. One night, Ektos heard a strange tone in the lab, and traced it to the latest generation of mushrooms.</p><br/><p>The team agreed to reframe their project to bring out the new audio qualities of the mushroom. By the end of 2920, they had developed a stable breeding population of mushrooms that produced varying tones depending on their size. Senae created a personal garden of the mushrooms in her dorm room, arranged so they resembled performers on a tiny stage. Hexa suggested the name \"opera mushroom\" after seeing this display. In early 2921, Ektos and Senae submitted their work on the opera mushroom to their dissertation committees and were awarded doctorates.</p><br/><h1>LIFECYCLE</h1><br/><p>After a four-week growing period, the constant motion of water through the mature mushroom causes ballistospores to slowly eject from the trumpet. After these spores fall onto a suitable substrate, they take root into a mycelium from which the mushrooms emerge. More and more mushrooms grow as the mycelium spreads underground, sometimes resulting in a widening ring-like pattern. Places where opera mushrooms grow can often be heard before they are seen.</p><br/><h1>COMMERCIAL DEBUT</h1><br/><p>Samples of the opera mushroom were made available to plant nurseries on Reisse in 2925. Thanks to its novelty and fast growth cycles, the fungus was an instant hit. It became a popular houseplant, especially for long-haul spacefarers in need of something low-maintenance to decorate their holds. Skilled gardeners can grow mushrooms in arrangements that produce harmonizing tones. </p><br/><p>In 2926, a wild, self-sustaining population of opera mushrooms was discovered 11 kilometers from the UR Genetics lab. The mushrooms continue to grow in the wild on Reisse today. It\u2019s a Day of the Vara tradition for some social organizations on the UR campus to tell ghost stories in nearby woodland with known opera mushroom populations to try to trick first year students into believing the woods are haunted", "title": "Galactapedia: Opera Mushroom", "id": "RWoozAmW82", "slug": "opera-mushroom", "template": "PlantAnimal", "type": "galactapedia"}, {"objectID": "14dab242b38b3e_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Tohil IV is a planet in the Tohil system, United Empire of Earth (UEE), and is the fourth world from its sun.

Elliot and Ed Fuller (mentioned in Q01, unsure on how their name is spelt) have been working on ideas and prototypes of what they'd like to do, where they'd like to have hacking be easy for the people who don't really want to engage with it, which might just mean that certain things only require a basic level of hacking ability, but for people who might want to make a hacking career they wanted to give it some sort of depth to facilitate that and make it enjoyable to do so, whilst also creating situations where some people might be considered hacking experts that other Players rely upon - which comes back to \"Easy to Learn, Difficult to Master\". The intent is to try and build something that could be PvP, such as a situation where Player 1 is hacking and Player 2 is trying to prevent the hack, maybe hacking each other, or Player 2 setting up traps that will alert them to the hack, so they know when to intervene. They're trying to get deep with it, but at the same time, if a Player just wants to get through a door then that should be do-able for everyone, whether they're hacking or just using a hacking chip that they bought. With regards to the chips that they've introduced with 3.6, they may eventually get relegated to being the \"buy your way out\" option if you're no good at hacking.", "time": "34m10s", "published_at_timestamp": 1564772763}, {"objectID": "1245823070", "title": "Star Citizen Live: Subscriber Event Special", "source": "https://youtu.be/9zPhpxYD7f8", "type": "youtube", "transcript": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/bq6b3f/a_summary_of_star_citizen_live_subscriber_event/", "time": "49m10s", "question": "What are the current or future plans to keep Players engaged during really lengthy Quantum Jumps?", "answer": "This is an ongoing conversation, and the topic of a lot of active discussions internally.

And our actual idea is there's a few ships that we want to have you play Squadron and if you get to the point in Squadron that you get to fly them, then you get the badge to be able to get that ship in the Persistent Universe. So if you're not Concierge at a very high level, you'll still be able to get the F8C, you just will have to have played Squadron far enough along, kind of near the end, it's sort of a little bit like Wing Commander where you move up in flying different ships as you get a little further on. And if you do that, you'll earn the badge, and I think this probably relates to another question that you have down here, and it will enable you to be able to purchase that in the PU after you've completed Squadron. So the idea is, essentially, Squadron has to come out and then it will be available and then you can either earn it by playing Squadron all the way through or as a thank you to some of the people that have really helped us make this game develop at a really supportive and incredibly enthusiastic level. We wanted to do a couple of nice things to say thank you, because we wouldn't be sitting here having this discussion, we wouldn't be building the game that we're building, we wouldn't be building Squadron to the level that we're building it to without the incredibly enthusiastic support, so that's kind of the idea of the Concierge program is that the people that sort of, you know, really, I don't know whether I say all in, but are more, you know, I mean everyone should, whether it's you just getting a basic ship, or you're doing a lot more, everything's appreciated and it's enabling us to do what we're doing and no one needs to do anything more than the very basic ship, but for the people that sort of go above and beyond, we want to have like a couple of fun things for them, a couple of items that, you know, it's kind of like a bit more sort of cool and flary, not necessarily something you can only get if you're that, because like I said, you'll be able to earn the F8C by completing Squadron and getting to the point where you actually get to fly an F8A in the game.<br/><br/>JH: Exactly, so that brings, that's a good follow point there. This is the F8C that we're talking about, similar to the Hornet F7C. The F8 that folks have been wondering about for the last several years is equivalent to the F7A, it's a military grade ship that's strictly for Squadron.<br/><br/>CR: Yeah, so I mean it's not the A, like the new F7A, which if you play Squadron, you'll also get an opportunity to earn the badge for, and then potentially get one of those in the persistent universe, but they're all, they have military grade equipment, which is a notch above some of the civilian grade equipment, so the Cs, whether it's the Hornet C or the F8C, they're still pretty awesome ships, but they don't quite have the sort of higher grade, more durable equipment that the military A version does. That's not to say in the game that you couldn't potentially figure out a way to get one or get the equipment to upgrade your ship to get there, but they don't sell the military grade stuff on the show floor.", "title": "Star Citizen: Reverse the Verse LIVE - Squadron 42 Q&A", "source": "https://youtu.be/fS6FpCpt5m4", "type": "youtube", "published_at_timestamp": 1517055120}, {"objectID": "869d8b1508075_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "When the manufacturing process is complete the ship moves the outpost forward and places it in the specified location.

I don't know whether there'll be a difference or a bonus between ... if you repair your captured Scythe with human parts if it's quite the same as getting captured Vanduul parts.

But if you start with someone that isn't as experienced, the more you take them into battles and stuff they'll level up and they'll get better and more experienced just like people do in real life. So we do do these stats for the NPCs because we need to track how they get better and everything; we're just not doing it for the player because we want the player to be you doing it and your skills, so it's you getting better playing the game, not necessarily just leveling up stuff.So that'll be there.

I believe the answer is going to be that you can. Obviously our first iteration of jump points will be just handling a single ship, because, as we build the technology, that seems like a logical place to start. Down the road, I do know that, there's a concept of a stargate wormhole for example, where you cruise through and arrive at your destination, I think our concept of a wormhole or jump point is much more in line with having something that's much more of a physical space, so something that you can actually traverse, and it has a finite distance and there are obstacles, as we saw in the SXSW previews we did for the jump points, so I believe the natural extension of that is yes, we'll start with one ship, and then I yes, you'll have multiple ships travelling through simultaneously. Whether or not you'll be able to fire weapons at each other, board each other, that simply hasn't been fleshed out yet, because there's no jump points yet, but once we have that and we determine what's fun, it'd suck to go into a jump point and have that not be fun, but as we build out the game we'll know more, but I know that's something that Chris would like to do, there's a lot of designers that would like to do, it's just something we'll have to build out to determine whether it's good for the game.Ricky Jutley: I think as like a base iteration, the first element would be making sure you can actually traverse and end up at some destinationTD: Yeah, getting through it is a good step pointRJ: Yeah, lets get that right as well.

One, trying to make the universe and the system feel as realistic as possible, also protecting people from those abusing the system for outside reasons, like gold farmers and stuff.So we were thinking that there would be several levels. We'll probably let you trade between players. There will be some level in most of the cases of a tax in trade between players. Very similar to if I right now want to give my car to someone, I would have to sign my title over to them, so there's a cost in signing the title over, and we will have that type of mechanic in a lot of the trades.I don't know on the player to player sales, we definitely want players to be able to sell to other players, so we're going to allow that. Depending on where you sell it, you'll obviously have to pay the taxes to your local place for selling. Just like you would have to pay sales tax if you're selling to other people here like where I am right now in California.I do want players to go and collect really cool things in parts of the galaxy and take them to other parts and sell them to players for convenience. I think we'll use the same system that we're talking about for the mission ratings where both the seller and the buyer can rate each other, whether you're a good seller or whether you're a good buyer, and so obviously if someone has a good reseller rating, then you feel more comfortable than if they don't.And of course buying from NPCs will probably be the safest of all the things that you can do... So I do think to a certain extent, you may or may not have to be suspicious of other players, although when a player's selling to you it's not quite the same as it is in the real world here. If you were gonna buy and sell it in our game, you probably would have to be face to face with that character and once you sell it, the item's gonna transfer.It's not the same as purchase something, give someone my credit card online here, and then the goods never show up, because we handle the brokering of the system, so we'll make it so people can't scam each other as far as that stuff goes.So I think it's gonna be better than real life, but we do want to keep a little element of real life in there where there could be the potential of some players to be more dishonest or try and screw other players over, and there's a pro and con to that, just to make the game more interesting.Maybe that's the sort of stuff that can only happen in the unregulated border worlds, wherein you couldn't do that in the UEE say on Earth or on Terra because on Terra, you would have to go through an official broker, and then you can't cheat in that case. But maybe you don't need the broker out on an outlaw planet. You may do that transaction 'cause it's gonna cost you less, 'cause it doesn't have the same taxes and fees, but then the risk is, maybe someone screws you over.That's kind of the risk/reward that we're thinking about playing with, and we want to build that into the game, which I think will make it pretty interesting.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 20.

Do you plan to achieve all these goals on day one? Or are some of them going to get phased in?
