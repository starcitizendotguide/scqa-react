Before becoming Imperator, he served as High-Secretary under his uncle Galor IX from 2722, overseeing the reconstruction of government buildings in the Meta-Baroque style of architecture. As Galor IX's health declined, Ulysses took on more and more of his day-to-day duties. After taking office in 2751, Ulysses directed most of the UEE's resources into completing the reconstruction project. During his time as Imperator, he stripped down environmental protections, raised taxes, lowered the minimum working age to 10, decreased government oversight of industry, suspended minimum wage, expanded police powers, rewrote treason laws, and enacted mass deregulations. His son, Linton XI, staged a coup in 2781. Ulysses X committed suicide before Linton XI's agents could reach him.

For example, finding people in outer-space and on the surface is relatively easy, but with caves the waypoint would be deep underground.", "answer": "Gareth thinks that it comes back to context. If there's AI in a cave, they need to make sure that they're not in a place with a bunch of crates, so that there isn't a situation where the Player crawls through a tiny hole, but then the AI has a bunch of crates despite there not being any way that those crates could have gotten there. This is a problem that could occur because the caves will be Procedurally Generated. As such, they need to make sure that the nature of the connected rooms has an overall context and a flow that makes sense when you're in that space. For things like finding a missing person, they need to make sure that they're in a pit that isn't necessarily near the entrance of the cave, but could also be very far in, so there should be lots of different places that person could be in, and if they're dead on the floor, it shouldn't be near the entrance. As such, they need to make sure that the space that's been Procedurally Generated fits the context of the mission. Luke adds that in regards to the marker/waypoint specifically, they have to be careful anyway, such as not putting the marker on the actual missing person, because that just gives it away and removes the need to actually search or explore. It could also create a problem where you go to the marker, and then you're just on the surface looking at a marker that's underground with no clear way of how to get there, so they will most likely put the marker on the entrance to the cave, but it depends on whether or not finding the cave entrance without a marker is fun. Gareth adds that because the caves are naturally dark spaces, it's also important to make sure that the space is readable, that the Player(s) can understand where they've go to go - for example, if it's a cave that then becomes a cavern with no natural light source, it'll be unclear what you're looking at and about to step into. On top of this, again it'll be things like not spawning box/cargo missions where you can't actually get the cargo out of the cave - challenging situations like having to throw a crate before climbing up somewhere would be fine, but if you have to crawl into the cave for example, then there'd be no way of getting that crate out.", "time": "27m52s", "published_at_timestamp": 1564772763}, {"objectID": "1245823050", "title": "Star Citizen Live: Subscriber Event Special", "published_at": "2019-05-17", "source": "https://youtu.be/9zPhpxYD7f8", "type": "youtube", "transcript": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/bq6b3f/a_summary_of_star_citizen_live_subscriber_event/", "time": "43m32s", "question": "When are we going to be able to follow more people than the current Friends List cap allows?", "answer": "This is more of a question for \"US2\" (assuming this means Turbulent), but Jared's going to chase it up and see if he can find an answer, which he would then pass on to Tyler Witkin who can post it on Spectrum at a later time.

So the large scale stuff is a nice respite, but I always like characters and making people feel unique and getting hooked into that sort of more personal story line. I would kind of go the latter, but the large scale stuff is super fun.Ben Lesnick: I like the small scale stuff. I certainly don't write as much as you do, but when we do things like sales and just the tiny little details that build the universe that don't matter at all.

In the Verse when we go to buy ships from a ship dealer will they have an enclosed track/shooting range for us to test out the ships before we buy them?", "answer": "That is a pretty good suggestion I would ... we haven't necessarily thought about that but one way probably to do that would be to allow someone that goes into a ship dealer to potentially boot up a quick sim, which is essentially what we do in Arena Commander, to allow you to feel the sim version of the ship around and feel it for a bit. So maybe you get a token to use that ship inside the Arena Commander sim-pod to see if you like it or not. And then perhaps you can go buy it.So we'll consider that because I think that's actually a pretty cool in-fiction, in-game way for people to maybe do a test drive.

Will they use some other means to get around us along their path or make us get our of their way (maybe based on their personality, i.e. try to squeeze past or ordering you to get the hell out of their way)?", "answer": "That's definitely something that is big on the list, it's a core feature to Squadron 42 which will also be used in the Persistent Universe, but in general what's going to happen is the encounters, characters moving around, it's not really going to be just some canned animation that plays.What will happen is, AI will have all the different fragments and pieces of various things the characters can do and then it sorts of systematically plays them based on situation, y'know, where you are with respect to the character, it can also adjust it's look procedurally or his or her look procedurally on the NPC side. So if you get in the way then it'll just sort of shift into locomotion to avoid you there will also be co-operative animations for people trying to squeeze past you, so we're really going to try to bring it a little more life-like.I think Uncharted, y'know the videos for the new Uncharted 4 but, Uncharted does a really good job of this for some of the NPC moving around with interactions.

Started with the demo and a pitch, never thought they'd have nearly the amount of support they've had. Chris thought he'd raise between 2 and 4 million, and he had private investors lined up to invest another 10 or so. Planned on working hard to get a smaller, much less ambitious alpha together, then use money from that to build it into the big Universe he wanted to build.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Smashed every single stretch goal set in the original campaign, then continued to talk about features, and the community continued to fund them.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Amazing amount of support with 85 million dollars. Allows a much more full featured and ambitious game. It's Chris' full dream game.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Feels like most people have gone, yeah, I want this game, and I'm going to give you the money to do it properly.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Yeah, the original campaign minimum amount was increased web communication, and now they post more times than there are days in the week.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Second promise was for a multiplayer dogfight, which we have in Arena Commander&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Last promise was a much smaller SQ42. Even the Persistent Universe was a stretch goal when they first started.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Game has definitely gotten bigger, which presents a bit of a problem. Doing more things will take more time. The end result will be better, but there are pros and cons.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; What about all the people at the beginning that are saying, hey, you said you were going to give me all this in two years? Yeah, they can't do that, but it's one of the reasons they went the route of offering multiple modules. Makes it so the players can play it and see features as the game goes along. Gives players something in the short term, and something at the end.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Originally weren't talking about Hangar module, Social module, FPS module, or anything. You get to experience the game in the short term, and you get to watch as the bigger game gets built around you, and built around your feedback.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Stretch goal after stretch goal, even though they keep bringing in people and getting people excited, at 65 million, they said there was a huge amount of stuff to get done, and they're going to focus on getting that finished out, and more money will focus on making everything that was promised as rich and good as possible.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Yes, it's increased in scope, but Chris thinks it's what everyone wants.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; It's the reason to go with crowdfunding too. If there were a publisher, they'd have likely said no, ship the smaller ambition. But with crowdfunding, the community sets the ambition. The community says, we want you to make something big and bold, and they funded us to be able to do that.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; There's a level of interaction that exists almost nowhere else.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Yes, the scope has changed, and it's changed because the fans wanted it to change, and supported it in changing.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; 'It's going to be worth it to stay the course'.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; The amount of game the people who got in for 40$ are going to get is the best deal in the Universe.

The one thing I see in this question is you purchase 1000 UEC for about a dollar, that right now is just an arbitrary correlative value. As we go to PU, at some point there has to be a switch-over that says, okay, either these items cost more in UEC now, and we change the whole scale, or we change the dollar value of UEC, but, that's something we're going to deal with when the PU is actually a thing, that we have UEC in the game as a thing you can earn, that will all have to get figured out.<br/><br/>RJ: Yeah, I think once we develop more of the features, and more of the in-game items and purchases, we'll be able to have a scale of exactly what's lower end, what's higher end, to find the scale, and actually give values that are going to be fair and applicable.<br/><br/>TD: One of the things I've seen people related to this asking questions on the forums, related to your initial KS pledges, saying, oh this package has 20,000 UEC, or 20,000 credits i think it was called at a time.

There might be an instance where you may only be able to take a bounty hunter mission if you're a member of that guild, or maybe it'll be aligned with certain other guilds, so they might not accept you if you were a member of an opposing guild.

Will there be a linear design (go here; do X) we have to follow or can we chose how to progress in a mission?", "answer": "The Persistent Universe is going have a combination of a whole bunch of stuff. So one is the procedurally generated stuff that comes out of the economy... A factory needs goods, and you take to mission to bring the goods from the planet to the factory... Or the factory could be asking for someone to protect the shipment of goods... Or the local law enforcement authority could be putting out an \"ambert alert\" or a bounty on a certain criminal, and you could take that mission. So there's a lot of missions that will be generated by the economy and created in reaction to what the NPCs are doing and what the players are doing in the universe.Then also in addition to that we'll have some more sort of scripted linear missions sprinkled in there for flavor and character, and those ones will tend to be maybe multi-mission ones where there's two or three parts to the mission and... maybe you have to track someone down, and you go to a place and get some information on where he is, which will take you somewhere else, and eventually you'll track down your target. Or smuggle some information from point A to point B.So we're gonna combine some scripted missions with procedural generation missions. And then also we allow our players themselves to create jobs or missions for other players. So I think between all that it should be pretty vibrant and interesting missions, and then it's kinda up to you what you want to take. So you don't have to do this thing first and then that thing afterwards. You could have maybe two, three or four missions on the go. Of course if you take a bunch of missions and you don't complete them that would knock your rating with the people you took the missions with, so they wouldn't necessarily want to hire you down the road. So you have to juggle all those things, but I think there's going to be some pretty... errr... a lot of options, let me put it that way.", "published_at": "2014-07-07", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 28.

The same kind of stuff happens if you're trying to navigate a jump point. There will definitely be a whole bunch of stuff that is non-combat oriented. There'll be that and we want you to have to, maybe some of your equipment breaks down and you're flying and you have to go fix it up. The classic sci-fi scenes you've seen where Scotty's trying to make the engines work on the Enterprise.So yeah, we are focused on that. That will be part of some of the stuff that we do on the capital ship stuff that the Foundry 42 team is working on.

If so, how do we get the ship out of the hangar without creating a vacuum?", "answer": "That is a good question, but the concept with the Dogfighting Module is actually that you're flying, essentially a simulation inside your hangar.So what will happen is, you'll be in the hangar, you'll get inside your Hornet, or any of the other ships that we'll have available for Dogfight v1, if you don't have any of those ships, we'll loan you a ship to fly in Dogfight v1. You'll climb in, and basically fire it up and at that point your HUD comes up and creates a \"Joining simulation\" interface.So we mentioned Arena Mode as a part of the game, where it allows you to practice flying around, fighting with your friends, but not taking your actual ship out into space and risking loss of equipment or life. That is what we're calling \"Arena Commander,\" it's a bit of a nod to a game I may have made in the past.You connect up through there and it's all done in fiction that you're connecting up to a battle net, and you will fight against other people.What happens is you step into the ship in your hangar, connect up, then the outside of the ship once you've connected, you come back out, and bam you're out in a virtual space, flying around dogfighting. Once you've finished the battle, you return back into your hangar, and of course there won't be any bullet holes on your ship because it was all a virtual simulation.It is the beginning of the stub of the Arena Mode which will be in the game, throughout the game. It's one of the features that will be useful, and I think longer term people would probably use this feature to do e-sports or challenge each other without having to lose their precious cargo or precious ships.So we don't have to worry about a vacuum at the moment because it's all virtual.", "published_at": "2014-03-24", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 13 (2014.03.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/IIkeFs5xubw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "SlackR", "published_at_timestamp": 1395698672}, {"objectID": "5282122a1d102_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Which Wing Commander-universe game is your favorite?
