It was discovered in 2499, and subsequently selected as the headquarters of the UEE Navy (UEEN). Once the center of a thriving industry centered around the UEEN\u2019s shipbuilding facilities, the system\u2019s economy crashed when the Navy moved their operations to Kilian in 2631. Though the system has entered a period of revitalization thanks to Drake Interplanetary establishing their headquarters and prime production facilities on Borea, its population is low compared to similarly aged systems in the UEE. It is made up of a chthonian planet, a terrestrial planet, a gas giant, and a K-type star.</p><br/><h1>DISCOVERY</h1><br/><p>In 2499, the Magnus system was discovered as a part of Project Far Star. Initial surveys of the system showed it to be uncommonly empty of asteroid fields, protoplanets, or other potential hazards for space travel. Only one of its three planets was identified as a good candidate for terraforming. The system\u2019s then-remote location and abundance of natural resources found in the planet closest to the sun attracted the attention of the then-United Planets of Earth Navy (UPEN), who were in search of a new center for shipbuilding. After procuring funding from the Senate in 2533, the UPEN began a military-run, closed-terraforming operation on Magnus II. </p><br/><h1>PLANETARY SYSTEM</h1><br/><p>The system\u2019s star, Magnus, is an orange-red K-Type main sequence star that is roughly 5 billion years old. Magnus I, a mineral-rich chthonian planet, orbits closest to the sun. The UEE Navy maintains exclusive mining rights to it, dating from the early 26th century. The super-Jupiter Magnus III, noted for its multi-chromatic bands of gas, orbits the furthest from the sun. Borea (Magnus II), a rocky terrestrial planet, is the only habitable planet in the system. Residents of Borea sometimes claim to outsiders that a fourth planet called \"Triggerfish\" orbits beyond Magnus III. It does not. This led to the creation of the eponymous popular holiday.</p><br/><h1>NOTABLE LOCATIONS</h1><br/><p><em>Borea (Magnus II)</em></p><br/><p>Borea is a temperate planet that was identified as a prime terraforming candidate when the system was discovered. It was held up as a landmark example of terraforming success, with many climates closely resembling those of Earth. A century of unfettered shipbuilding, however, polluted the atmosphere, essentially rolling back some of the changes previously made by terraforming and transforming the climate to the harsh one it is known for today. </p><br/><h1>CULTURE</h1><br/><p>Those who did not follow the Navy when it left for Kilian took up residence in Borea\u2019s abandoned properties and started up businesses in cheap ship repair and bootleg components fueled by harvested scrap. The system developed a reputation as a place where people who wanted to escape their past could reinvent themselves, no questions asked. </p><br/><p>The empty warehouses and monolithic industrial equipment deemed too expensive to transport by the UEEN are no longer being left to deteriorate. Drake Interplanetary purchased much of them from the UEE in 2845 for very low cost, opting to open factories and set up their headquarters in Odyssa on Borea instead of more cosmopolitan systems like Terra. Job opportunities are increasing, and once-disreputable ghost towns are being repaired as more and more people choose to migrate to Magnus. The system\u2019s economy is slowly on the mend.

It premiered in SEY 2944, in the wake of a widely reported upon, three-month disappearance by Terrell. After his sudden reappearance, Terrell was fired by his former employers at the New United and established <em>Plain Truth</em>. The show is filmed on Terra (Terra III). It currently operates as an independent investigative unit, focusing on controversial and sensationalist Human interest and political stories. The show is often critical of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) government. </p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>Parker Terrell was an investigative journalist with the New United for 11 years, where he developed a reputation for often combative political stories. He was sometimes censured by his employers for taking too much of an editorial stance in his columns, but as his articles drew in audiences, he was retained. On 19 June 2943, Terrell appeared on the debate show <em>Showdown</em> where he asserted on the air that the UEE used an illegal super-weapon to destroy the surface of the planet Ellis XI. He disappeared less than a week later. A missing persons report was filed on 30 June. No note was found, and Terrell\u2019s personal ship was missing from its hangar. </p><br/><p>Terrell\u2019s ship was recovered from Vann (Croshaw III) on 10 August 2943.

On 08 October 2943, Terrell appeared on <em>Showdown</em>, where he asserted that \u2018shadowy government agents\u2019 had chased him into hiding and repeated his accusation that the UEE had tested a planet-killing weapon on Ellis XI. After he refused to recant, the <em>New United</em> NewsOrg chose to terminate his contract.</p><br/><p>Terrell was hired by SSN/CAtv on 11 October 2943 to develop a news show. The first episode of <em>Plain Truth</em> premiered on 01 April 2944. In it, Terrell interviewed Daniel Warden, an independent courier who had been stopped by UEE Customs upon his entry in the Helios system and unlawfully detained for three weeks. During his imprisonment, Warden was questioned by Advocacy agents about people he had never met and about his activities in the Nexus system. Following Terrell\u2019s broadcast, Warden received an undisclosed amount of credits as compensation from the UEE for his detention.

For example, finding people in outer-space and on the surface is relatively easy, but with caves the waypoint would be deep underground.", "answer": "Gareth thinks that it comes back to context. If there's AI in a cave, they need to make sure that they're not in a place with a bunch of crates, so that there isn't a situation where the Player crawls through a tiny hole, but then the AI has a bunch of crates despite there not being any way that those crates could have gotten there. This is a problem that could occur because the caves will be Procedurally Generated. As such, they need to make sure that the nature of the connected rooms has an overall context and a flow that makes sense when you're in that space. For things like finding a missing person, they need to make sure that they're in a pit that isn't necessarily near the entrance of the cave, but could also be very far in, so there should be lots of different places that person could be in, and if they're dead on the floor, it shouldn't be near the entrance. As such, they need to make sure that the space that's been Procedurally Generated fits the context of the mission. Luke adds that in regards to the marker/waypoint specifically, they have to be careful anyway, such as not putting the marker on the actual missing person, because that just gives it away and removes the need to actually search or explore. It could also create a problem where you go to the marker, and then you're just on the surface looking at a marker that's underground with no clear way of how to get there, so they will most likely put the marker on the entrance to the cave, but it depends on whether or not finding the cave entrance without a marker is fun. Gareth adds that because the caves are naturally dark spaces, it's also important to make sure that the space is readable, that the Player(s) can understand where they've go to go - for example, if it's a cave that then becomes a cavern with no natural light source, it'll be unclear what you're looking at and about to step into. On top of this, again it'll be things like not spawning box/cargo missions where you can't actually get the cargo out of the cave - challenging situations like having to throw a crate before climbing up somewhere would be fine, but if you have to crawl into the cave for example, then there'd be no way of getting that crate out.", "time": "27m52s", "published_at_timestamp": 1564772763}, {"objectID": "1245823050", "title": "Star Citizen Live: Subscriber Event Special", "source": "https://youtu.be/9zPhpxYD7f8", "type": "youtube", "transcript": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/bq6b3f/a_summary_of_star_citizen_live_subscriber_event/", "time": "43m32s", "question": "When are we going to be able to follow more people than the current Friends List cap allows?", "answer": "This is more of a question for \"US2\" (assuming this means Turbulent), but Jared's going to chase it up and see if he can find an answer, which he would then pass on to Tyler Witkin who can post it on Spectrum at a later time.

That much said, in terms of the immediate impact to the company, it\u2019s actually been somewhat surprisingly positive because of the change in exchange rates and the fact that we as a company do the majority of our development in the UK, but of course the majority of our revenue is in US dollars, it actually meant that given the Sterling crash, UK development has effectively become cheaper. Additional to that is the tax credits situation from the UK government, that law is likely to change due to the way it was implemented as a European-wide law, but right now at least the UK government is promising that will stay intact. So short to medium term looks ok, obviously we have a 2 year period while the UK negotiates its exit from the EU, longer term is of course still unpredictable until we get the detail on how the exit works.

So there's a lot of missions that will be generated by the economy and created in reaction to what the NPCs are doing and what the players are doing in the universe.Then also in addition to that we'll have some more sort of scripted linear missions sprinkled in there for flavor and character, and those ones will tend to be maybe multi-mission ones where there's two or three parts to the mission and... maybe you have to track someone down, and you go to a place and get some information on where he is, which will take you somewhere else, and eventually you'll track down your target. Or smuggle some information from point A to point B.So we're gonna combine some scripted missions with procedural generation missions. And then also we allow our players themselves to create jobs or missions for other players. So I think between all that it should be pretty vibrant and interesting missions, and then it's kinda up to you what you want to take. So you don't have to do this thing first and then that thing afterwards. You could have maybe two, three or four missions on the go. Of course if you take a bunch of missions and you don't complete them that would knock your rating with the people you took the missions with, so they wouldn't necessarily want to hire you down the road. So you have to juggle all those things, but I think there's going to be some pretty... errr... a lot of options, let me put it that way.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 28.

The same kind of stuff happens if you're trying to navigate a jump point. There will definitely be a whole bunch of stuff that is non-combat oriented. There'll be that and we want you to have to, maybe some of your equipment breaks down and you're flying and you have to go fix it up. The classic sci-fi scenes you've seen where Scotty's trying to make the engines work on the Enterprise.So yeah, we are focused on that. That will be part of some of the stuff that we do on the capital ship stuff that the Foundry 42 team is working on. They're gonna bring some of that, but environmental effects on your ship are definitely a core part of what we want to do to make the universe feel big and alive and rich.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 21.

If so, how do we get the ship out of the hangar without creating a vacuum?", "answer": "That is a good question, but the concept with the Dogfighting Module is actually that you're flying, essentially a simulation inside your hangar.So what will happen is, you'll be in the hangar, you'll get inside your Hornet, or any of the other ships that we'll have available for Dogfight v1, if you don't have any of those ships, we'll loan you a ship to fly in Dogfight v1. You'll climb in, and basically fire it up and at that point your HUD comes up and creates a \"Joining simulation\" interface.So we mentioned Arena Mode as a part of the game, where it allows you to practice flying around, fighting with your friends, but not taking your actual ship out into space and risking loss of equipment or life. That is what we're calling \"Arena Commander,\" it's a bit of a nod to a game I may have made in the past.You connect up through there and it's all done in fiction that you're connecting up to a battle net, and you will fight against other people.What happens is you step into the ship in your hangar, connect up, then the outside of the ship once you've connected, you come back out, and bam you're out in a virtual space, flying around dogfighting. Once you've finished the battle, you return back into your hangar, and of course there won't be any bullet holes on your ship because it was all a virtual simulation.It is the beginning of the stub of the Arena Mode which will be in the game, throughout the game. It's one of the features that will be useful, and I think longer term people would probably use this feature to do e-sports or challenge each other without having to lose their precious cargo or precious ships.So we don't have to worry about a vacuum at the moment because it's all virtual.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 13 (2014.03.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/IIkeFs5xubw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "SlackR", "published_at_timestamp": 1395698672}, {"objectID": "5282122a1d102_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Which Wing Commander-universe game is your favorite?
