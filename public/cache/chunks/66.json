Located at the outer edge of the system's habitable zone, microTech is mostly ice, with some cold-to-temperate areas of tundra. It was purchased from the UEE by the corporation microTech in the mid-2800s. Its capital, New Babbage, is home to many corporations and startups and is a major center for technological innovation.</p><br/><h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1><br/><p>Most of microTech is covered in mountains and ice sheets and subject to strong blizzards and ice storms. There are very few liquid bodies of water. Multiple temperate tundra zones exist in areas associated with deep geothermal activity. Camping expeditions and hikes in these greener biomes are popular vacation activities among microTech\u2019s full-time population. Cold-hardy plants such as evergreens, wildflowers, grasses, and lichen grow there throughout the year.</p><br/><p>Thawort, a lichen that grows on microTech and other worlds with arctic climates, is the subject of research for several pharmaceutical startups based in New Babbage. Its antiseptic and antibacterial properties have shown promise in the lab, though the properties are only present in wild-collected specimens. Research to replicate these traits in artificial conditions is ongoing. </p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>Discovered in 2851, Stanton IV is a super-Earth, and one of four planets in the Stanton system's habitable zone. Full development of the system would have taken funds not readily available to the government at the time. After beginning initial terraforming, the UEE announced the decision in 2865 to sell it and its sibling planets to private interests in order to help pay down its debts and provide a boost to the downturned economy.  </p><br/><p>An early terraforming error resulted in a climate far colder and harsher than initial projections had indicated, leading to multiple debates on the UEE Senate floor regarding the government's ability to sell Stanton IV. However, it was thanks to this error that founder and then-CEO of microTech Magnus Tobin purchased it as the new headquarters for microTech. Tobin sold off land his company had been using for server farms in the leadup to this acquisition. According to a contemporary press release, the \"reliably frigid\" climate of Stanton IV was ideal for keeping their expansive network of servers cool. Tobin personally oversaw the construction of New Babbage, the largest city and now-headquarters of microTech at large. </p><br/><h1>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</h1><br/><p>Planetary governance is conducted by specialized divisions of the microTech corporation. Population-sustaining departments such as water infrastructure and waste management exist alongside economic ones such as taxation, business licensing, and import/export. Former elected officials or government workers are typically hired for these roles, though those from the private-sector are not barred from selection. Upon their purchase of the planet, microTech upgraded their corporate security force to perform police actions where necessary. Wherever possible, microTech utilizes technology and custom microTech-designed systems and software to automate much of the day-to-day operations, including the enforcement of local laws. As immigration to microTech increases, leaders within microTech have debated the implementation of an eventual population cap. </p><br/><h1>CULTURE</h1><br/><p>The city of New Babbage was designed to support the creativity of the highly-skilled workforce needed to drive microTech's future innovation. Areas like the Commons were constructed as creative workspaces, dedicated to providing areas for programmers and engineers to relax, network, and plan. The city's robust nightlife provides an outlet for the workforce's high-pressure crunch times and higher-than-average salaries, and visiting financiers and venture capitalists make regular use of the high-end bars. Inhabitants also like to escape the confines of the city to take part in outdoor cold weather activities. </p><br/><p>Bleeding-edge technology is a common sight on microTech. Not only due to the company itself, but also the presence of other established tech companies alongside a constantly-cycling roster of startups. Residents who don't keep abreast of the latest advances are generally seen as gauche by their peers, though this outlook varies.

Players have had some form of item 2.0 for a very long time. It\u2019s items that have been componentized vs entities that have a whole set of properties on them. So Item 2.0 is really is the componentization of functionality per item. Maybe that isn\u2019t a perfect way to frame it in one sentence but what it does is takes all the properties and generalizes them as much as possible so we can apply gameplay components onto them or any item regardless of its entity type.<br /><br />What we are doing is taking the Lumberyard engine from being a purely entity driven engine to being a componentized system, meaning you can share components between different items or entities so you don\u2019t have to write bespoke code for every single entity.<br /><br />An animated object within Lumberyard was an entity and that had a certain set of properties so of the big ones being a model, animations and some physics. All of these were written in terms of the item entity so instead to componentize that and move that entity from an item 1.0 to an item 2.0 you would have to decouple all of those properties from the entity itself. So you turn it into an item first of all but it cannot do anything by itself, we call it a game object, it\u2019s just a concept of a container waiting for components.<br /><br />The first component I add is the geometry component, something which can be shared across pretty much any item. Then you might have an animation component which would be added to the same item and at this point we almost have the same entity in a componentized way. We have to write all those components up, so the conversion is a slow one as we have to slowly removing all the bespoke entities from Lumberyard and turning them into a componentized system.<br /><br />EKD: Which allows for some really exciting gameplay implications because once you have things in this way there are more interesting things you can do with them. Which is a large part of the gameplay aspect of what we are making is, utilizing that level of granularity which is really cool.<br /><br />ST: It also just makes things easier to make, by far. The geometry component was the most obvious one right out of the gate, so that was the first one we wrote. Now we can assign geometry to any item through this one component, this one block of code that applies to everything. Rather than whole separate entities dealing with their things independently and if we change something we have to change it across 100,000 different entities, which creates too much work.<br /><br />So one of the other things on top of this is the performance it brings us and the ability to optimize. When you have so many entities with so many different properties you have a hard job doing large scheduling updates. What we can do with these components is make an entity scheduler and make it update the component so many times per frame or if an item has a geometry component that\u2019s over 10 feet away say don\u2019t updated that one. It is these kind of optimizations we can make in a component based system that is the whole reasoning behind doing it.", "title": "Exclusive Star Citizen Interview With Sean Tracy & Eric Kieron Davis", "source": "https://youtu.be/xGV2996y4Jk", "time": "9m49s", "type": "youtube", "user": "Oliver East", "transcript": "http://www.justpushstart.com/2017/03/exclusive-star-citizen-interview-sean-tracy-eric-kieron-davis-full-transcript/3/", "published_at_timestamp": 1490484602}, {"objectID": "373672150", "question": "When will we be able to hire NPC as crew, will it be at first when they appear?", "answer": "For 3.0 no, they're still working on some of the NPC elements of having them interact with you and have them be more than just a person filling the seat.

'I know it has been mentioned that clothing / character equipment will have an item port system, somewhat similar to ships. Can you give us any examples using specific clothing and other equipment? For example, will pockets serve as item ports, and not just be cosmetic? Will wearing a pocketed vest over coverall spacesuit increase the number of items, small enough to fit the pocket of course one can carry? Also, can one have a holster for a pistol sized weapon, not just on a belt, but between a shirt or a trenchcoat, or strapped to a space suit?Jeremiah Lee: So the way, I hope I'm right but, I know I'm right... I think I'm right...WW: Well, this is your current thinking on the subject, subject to change...JL: Yes, but, from what we have currently is that each suit or each clothing have a specific item slot. Now, we can't say that oh, if my heavy marine chestpiece, chest plate, has eight slots, then I can stuff eight pistols, like that's not how it's going to work right? So, each item slot will be specific for a specific size or a specific type of item. So, for instance, instead of having six magazines, maybe you want six medpens for instance. Like, the question that Johnny_71 asked, for in the case of a medic, right, so that's how we're going to do our item slots, and so when it comes to layer clothing though, it's still in the works. So that's not... we're not quite sure how we're going to tackle that necessarily, like dusters and stuff. we don't have space cowboys...WW: Yeah, trying to figure out how pockets are going to work. I mean, it would be nice if there was a reason why you change out of your t-shirt and jeans into work clothes, because they provide you with extra storage for, you know to put on that tool belt before you went out to go do your repair job, so I mean I think that's kind of an interesting layer and you know, hopefully factoring in possibly how NPCs react to based on what you're wearing is something we've started to look at potentially, so walking around town in your full armour might get you slightly different reactions than walking around in your sweet sweet leather coat.JL: And I don't think we're going to necessarily approach it like kinda how MMORPG's kind of treat it, like you have 36 item slots and so you can carry six bazookas, and you're wearing them like a jacket, like, I mean, it doesn't really make sense so, we're still fleshing that part out but I think the vision that we have is those item slots are kind of locked for specific item types and sizes.WW: Cause the way you're designing it is like, is everything visible right now?JL: Yes.WW: So like if you have three grenades, you can actually see those three grenades on yourself, so I think that's going to carry over to a lot of things, like maybe you'll have a backpack if you want to carry around a lot of stuff, but umm... that's really, I'm really excited about that, that you'll be able to see it being depleted on a guy, or being able to eye check an enemy and know if they have grenades.JL: Right. 'Do you have any weapons on you?' and have like six grenades. 'Noooooo'.Both: [laugh]JL: Like, the way we have the marine set up right now is we have the magnetic attachment points, and you can actually see those magnetic attachment points, it was so hard to place them in the right areas, and to look cool at the same time, but literally we have specific magnets to match specific items, so... like for instance we might have grenades on the right side, and the magazines on your waist, and the holster for your gun on your right thigh I think, so we have specific magnetic points, especially for the military. Yeah.WW: It's interesting. Something that looks kind of neat and futuristic in real life, like you know, a gun being stuck onto a chest or stuck onto a leg, looks really kind of fake in videogames because it's so easy just to stick junk onto a character, so like when you see... so it's definitely a careful balance to make it look and feel good.JL: Exactly...", "published_at_timestamp": 1452554872, "question": "I have similar questions about the item ports system for clothing/gear.

You could mix and match say breast plates or shoulder guards or armour padding on the legs and that absolutely will be based on physical hit location and the density and strength of the material you're hitter there that will come with the physically based weapon damage stuff that we will be working on. It's not going to be in 2.0 it will come when we bring the newer refactored items to the table which is likely to be probably 2.2 I would think.

Space stations exist in just one instance, and that instance can't be copied. The difference is if you're in orbit around Earth for example, there might be thousands of people around there, so there might be 100 people per instance and 1000 players, there might be 10 different instances supporting them, which could potentially be at different places around Earth. If you're one of those players you'll never really be able to see ALL the players around Earth at once, and the people you DO see will be those that are friends, POI's or enemies. In the case of a space station or bengals etc, only one of those instances would have that large ship/station in it to be able to be taken over.

We have seen everything from light filled \"tunnels\" that you surf, ala the Wing Commander movie, Stargate, or Freelancer, to streaking stars in Star Wars and Star Trek. Do you plan something visually along those lines, or do you have a unique artistic twist up your sleeve that you don't mind sharing with us?", "answer": "We're actually taking an early look at the jump-point worm-hole travel. We have two basic forms of fast-travelling in space at the moment, the first is jump-hole travel, so you go through a fold in space, and the second is Quantum travel which is the \"in system\" fast travel where your ship goes into a fast-mode. One way to look at why the engines on the back of your ship are so large compared to the little manoeuvring thrusters is that their primary function is to get you into Quantum travel which is about .2c or a little faster. You can only do Quantum drive in a straight line, we have a cool mechanic planned for that, including engaging or avoiding engagements while travelling. The drives will take some time to power up before you reach Quantum travel, and you've got to be lined up with the destination, and stay lined up for a certain time or distance. The engines are creating a massive gravitational field for you to reach those speeds, which requires a lot of power so you might be vulnerable considering you're not dodging fire either. Anyone that gets in front of you might be able to break your quantum drive build-up too. That's our in-system fast travel anyway.Jump point travel is used to get to completely new systems/areas of space, and the idea we've talked about here is kind of like surfing a huge wave like on the north shore of Hawaii, so it's like time and space moving around inside this wave or tunnel, with holes into regular space and other potential obstacles making it challenging to navigate for the first time. We're also thinking that over time the navigation data of a jump point might become out of date and need to be re-mapped manually. Some might be very stable and last a long time, where others might be so unstable the data is pretty much only good for that one jump, so might need to always be navigated manually. There are some that support bigger ships where there might be a jump point that's small and unstable enough that you really need a manoeuvrable ship small enough to go through, which might get you somewhere others can't get to or at least could give you a shortcut over a longer, more stable route.

Our current plan is basically you do it, there's one path, and that's it. But it would actually be kind of interesting that there is more than one way to do it.

An instantaneous hop to another system or a more or less dangerous race through some kind of warp-tunnel?", "answer": "It's definitely going to be more of a transitional effect through a warp tunnel. If you're navigating the jump point for the first time it's definitely pretty dangerous, you'll almost have to surf it, like you're trying to stay on the warp-wave until you've ridden it out at the other end of the rip in the space-time continuum. Once you've done that you'll have the transitional effect as I mentioned before, but it's the same effect you just don't need to pilot it yourself.

I would say Auroras probably make up something like 60 or 70 percent of the actual ships and pledges out there. Then beyond that, it's sort of, the next highest one is the 300i, then it's followed by the Hornet, then it's followed by the Freelancer, then it's followed by the Constellation. So, errr... I dunno... I would say there's probably... well, maybe 60 or 70 percent was high for the Aurora, but I would definitely say there was two, two-and-a-half times as many Auroras as there were 300is.But having said that, when you ask \"will these numbers factor in with the economic model?\" yes, they will because we're gonna be designing the economy in such a way that all ships have to be produced. And so the simplest ships - so the Auroras - will be produced in much more volume than, say, a much rarer ship - something like an Idris corvette. And so once you're flying around in the game, obviously the Auroras would probably be plentiful, in terms of being able to buy them in the same way that probably getting a Ford Fiesta is plentiful, or, you know, some sort of not particularly expensive or fancy car. And it will factor in... so therefore the numbers of them from our standpoint hopefully will correlate through, in terms of for what people have now and also kinda the frequency or rarity that they are in the game.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 35 (2014.08.25)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Uyur8rqbEHc", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Qanniqtuq", "published_at_timestamp": 1409004035}, {"objectID": "373683950", "question": "Will we be able to scale the output and cap the max output of any individual or set of thrusters on the fly?So when I slam on my joysick, instead of the thruster firing at full force, it maxes out at whatever I told it to?", "answer": "Yeah, that's a pretty good question, we definitely have the ability to change the power to the thrusters on either an individual basis or a group basis, and the power to the thruster also controls how much the thruster can fire.

It would be something that potentially I think we may play with, 'cause I sort of...I mean I guess this is really saying \"I would like to balance my ship a little differently,\" which I think should be allowable, to some level.

And we think that would make it interesting, like a mountain pass. Some mountain passes are big and you can fit a lot of people through, and some are small and you can only fit one through the craggy little pathway.So yes, we are definitely doing that, we haven't fully figured out what are the pros and cons of what classifies jump points that way or what the situations are, but that's part of our thinking to make space traversal more interesting.Maybe an info runner, a smaller ship, can get a more direct route because they can go through some smaller, unstable jump points that a really big ship can't get through.

It's less about faster clock speed, and more about more CPUs.Memory, definitely, the more memory the better. We'll be able to pre-cache more, and you'll have higher resolution textures. If we're running low on the memory side, you would probably reduce the textures, where as if you have 16-32 GB, you may get them at the full 4k resolution in some cases, or there'll be less disc loading, so we'll be able to pre-cache more into memory.So I would definitely recommend having a multi-core CPU and lots of memory.Most of my machines all have 32 GB or more.
