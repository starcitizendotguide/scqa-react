Located at the outer edge of the system's habitable zone, microTech is mostly ice, with some cold-to-temperate areas of tundra. It was purchased from the UEE by the corporation microTech in the mid-2800s. Its capital, New Babbage, is home to many corporations and startups and is a major center for technological innovation.</p><br/><h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1><br/><p>Most of microTech is covered in mountains and ice sheets and subject to strong blizzards and ice storms. There are very few liquid bodies of water. Multiple temperate tundra zones exist in areas associated with deep geothermal activity. Camping expeditions and hikes in these greener biomes are popular vacation activities among microTech\u2019s full-time population. Cold-hardy plants such as evergreens, wildflowers, grasses, and lichen grow there throughout the year.</p><br/><p>Thawort, a lichen that grows on microTech and other worlds with arctic climates, is the subject of research for several pharmaceutical startups based in New Babbage. Its antiseptic and antibacterial properties have shown promise in the lab, though the properties are only present in wild-collected specimens. Research to replicate these traits in artificial conditions is ongoing. </p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>Discovered in 2851, Stanton IV is a super-Earth, and one of four planets in the Stanton system's habitable zone. Full development of the system would have taken funds not readily available to the government at the time. After beginning initial terraforming, the UEE announced the decision in 2865 to sell it and its sibling planets to private interests in order to help pay down its debts and provide a boost to the downturned economy.  </p><br/><p>An early terraforming error resulted in a climate far colder and harsher than initial projections had indicated, leading to multiple debates on the UEE Senate floor regarding the government's ability to sell Stanton IV. However, it was thanks to this error that founder and then-CEO of microTech Magnus Tobin purchased it as the new headquarters for microTech. Tobin sold off land his company had been using for server farms in the leadup to this acquisition. According to a contemporary press release, the \"reliably frigid\" climate of Stanton IV was ideal for keeping their expansive network of servers cool. Tobin personally oversaw the construction of New Babbage, the largest city and now-headquarters of microTech at large. </p><br/><h1>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</h1><br/><p>Planetary governance is conducted by specialized divisions of the microTech corporation. Population-sustaining departments such as water infrastructure and waste management exist alongside economic ones such as taxation, business licensing, and import/export. Former elected officials or government workers are typically hired for these roles, though those from the private-sector are not barred from selection. Upon their purchase of the planet, microTech upgraded their corporate security force to perform police actions where necessary. Wherever possible, microTech utilizes technology and custom microTech-designed systems and software to automate much of the day-to-day operations, including the enforcement of local laws. As immigration to microTech increases, leaders within microTech have debated the implementation of an eventual population cap. </p><br/><h1>CULTURE</h1><br/><p>The city of New Babbage was designed to support the creativity of the highly-skilled workforce needed to drive microTech's future innovation. Areas like the Commons were constructed as creative workspaces, dedicated to providing areas for programmers and engineers to relax, network, and plan. The city's robust nightlife provides an outlet for the workforce's high-pressure crunch times and higher-than-average salaries, and visiting financiers and venture capitalists make regular use of the high-end bars. Inhabitants also like to escape the confines of the city to take part in outdoor cold weather activities. </p><br/><p>Bleeding-edge technology is a common sight on microTech. Not only due to the company itself, but also the presence of other established tech companies alongside a constantly-cycling roster of startups. Residents who don't keep abreast of the latest advances are generally seen as gauche by their peers, though this outlook varies.

A lot of the river tech when it was made was made with kind of like and roads in mind in terms of there's a lot of similarities in terms of kind of like dynamically creating and destroying things as you approach it on or across a long spline, because if you just load a mesh for a 100 kilometer road, that's obviously not going to work. But it takes some time and some investment into the tooling and it's making the assets and getting design and so on. We want to approach it. We're not approaching it this second.<br/><br/>AB: Yeah, just to add to that, we've got Will's done a lot of the groundwork for that. So on the planet side, a lot of the work has been done or wouldn't take much to take it further. You know, there's not a huge difference on the planet side between a river and a road. Where the work remains is there's a bit of graphics work to do. Obviously, a road doesn't look like a river. We need whatever stylistically we need to change there. And presumably, you know, the whatever assets would be distributed at the side of the road would be slightly different to a river. But probably the biggest difference is we assume it would come from Starchitect. Like you would have to place all these locations on the planet. And then we have to figure out what would be the logical distribution of roads. There will need to be rule sets. You know, does this planet support roads? Is there areas of the planet that will and won't have roads? You know, maybe outlaw bases don't have roads. They don't want to be signposted with a big motorway to an outlaw base. But, you know, some places will. So it's that element that is the biggest part that's missing. And then obviously there'll be a bit of once you have decided to connect two towns or locations. There's some code to figure out what is the best path to get between these two. Do I carve straight through every mountainside or should I weave around them? So there's a bit there. So on the planet side, we've kind of done it. But mostly on the tool side, we're deciding where the roads would go.

Why has the gap been so long between tech preview tests for this? And is this really working as well as we hope?", "answer": "So yeah, later in the spring, end of spring, we did a couple of good tests that gave us a lot of good data, right? So what we've been trying to do on the meshing side is be a bit more pragmatic and methodical in how we approach the development. And so these tests really gave us a lot of data, right? Because of the way we conducted them, we were able to try different mesh configurations, look at performance specifically on the hybrid, which is the replication layer of service. And to really be able to hone in on what we need to improve in order to get the scale that we want. And so what came out of these tests in the spring was that there was already things that were touching on the performance of the hybrid and the game server communications that needed improvement. And so this is what we call the components called the NMQ, the network message queue. Now there's a lot of chatter online about, you know, there's a replacement thing and it's called, is it RabbitMQ, whatever. No, so we're not even in that realm. We're talking about really the networking component that transmits data between game server and client, game server and hybrid, hybrid and game servers. It's like this, think of it as the communication library underneath it. So like all games, that technology is using UDP transport to get, you know, eventually consistent updates out as fast as possible. Now, the network message queue had a couple of issues when it got a lot of data in a very short period of time. So these spikes would cause, and that's what we saw in the final server meshing tech previews, was that when large areas would stream in and a lot of players would join in and leave at the same time, the network message queue could go into a tailspin where, think of it as a drain, right? And you're trying to put stuff in the drain. And at some point, if you exceed the bandwidth of the drain, then water starts filling up. Now, the way that manifests itself in the game is interaction delays. So, you know, pressing F trying to get in the ship and it takes seconds before the system reacts, powering on ship takes forever. You know, now I'm not talking about the one offs because you can have interaction delay in your game based on your connection. That can absolutely happen. So it's influenced by your machine, your connection. So if you're playing on a 486 without the turbo button on a satellite connection, you know, you might get interaction delay, right? But in this case, we're talking about widespread, like when an entire shard gets into that state, right? So that's what we saw in the tech preview. So that we had to go a little bit back on the drawing board and actually fast track one of the refactors we wanted to do, which is the introduction of a replacement message queue. Now we call it replication message queue, replacement message queue kind of, you know, we've basically called it RMQ. And so this RMQ is a new implementation of this that has more abilities to adapt to higher bandwidth and react to these large message pushes that happen when we start to stream in large areas or when a lot of players are coming in and out of the game rapidly. And so what we're testing now is RMQ in a server mesh setting. So for you guys who don't know, 3.24, half of the servers on live currently run RMQ. The other ones are running NMQ still. We've been gathering data across both of them to see the performance improvements, the gains. So far, those have been really good, a lot of really good improvements. And so now we want to test this in a server mesh setting. So what changes in a server mesh setting is that now the hybrid is going to manage more than one game server that simulate these key areas. And so there's more traffic going through the hybrid for this at key moments. And so that's what we want to test with this next set of tech previews. So what our hope is, is that the issues that plagued the 800 players last time where there was a lot of interaction delays. Also, some of those tests had a lot of game server crashes at the time that we did the test. But in this case, we're hopeful that all these interactions delays will be basically gone from this bandwidth side of it. So that means we can get to bigger shards and the experience is going to be enjoyable across that. The thing that actually did work really well in our spring test was the actual server meshing tech. So authority transfer, management of territories, all that stuff was fantastic. A really big success. But we did need to take a little bit of a sideways step to optimize the RMQ, which is now done.

I mean, I think we had some early concepts that they were really cool, but they were also not necessarily the most optimal for performance reasons, and one of the passes was to sort of make some of the ships come closer to the way that Nathan Dearsley built the Scythe, which is also the Glaive really, and so I would say that we're more bringing things closer to that style, and we're still doing some developmental work on things like the kingship and stuff like that, so there's a lot, but some of our very early concepts were sort of more kind of bony, ribby, spiky, and so we still have some of those aspects, but not quite as high frequency because that ends up being problematic, and yeah, the poly count you need for the ships, so we'd rather be using things that we can use a lot of our custom normals and some of the kind of detail and pod mapping that we do that gives you this really great detail.

I mean, the concept that we have is that as you play Squadron, it sort of fills out your journal. Like if you imagined you have a journal from back in the day that you were serving in the military, and as you go through it, it fills out your journal, and then the things that you've managed to do will sort of unlock some stuff in the PU, and you can always look back on it, like your achievement or scrapbook or whatever, and see what you did or what you achieved. But we don't really have, you know, yes, we have more than one ending, but generally it's the, you know, you died, you sucked, you got thrown in the brig, whatever, versus you got to the end of the story. So, you know, in general we sort of assume that you will get to the end of the story, but, you know, whatever you have in the PU is based on what you've earned today. So it's like your journal hasn't been full, because you could be playing Squadron while playing the PU at the same time, and, you know, only be, say, a third of the way through Squadron, you haven't got to later things and earn later things, and so obviously you wouldn't have them in the PU until you got there in Squadron, until you got there in Squadron, and then it would unlock things in the PU. But, so, in that way it will affect kind of things you can get and unlock things, but it's more about your progress through it. So once you get all the way through it and you've done all the things, you'll unlock it, and there are some things you can do that are optional, so you may or may not unlock them or get them later on in the PU.", "title": "Star Citizen: Reverse the Verse LIVE - Squadron 42 Q&A", "source": "https://youtu.be/fS6FpCpt5m4", "type": "youtube", "published_at_timestamp": 1517055120}, {"objectID": "90334cc1a036e_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The X1 Baseline is the all-rounder of the three.

Players have had some form of item 2.0 for a very long time. It\u2019s items that have been componentized vs entities that have a whole set of properties on them. So Item 2.0 is really is the componentization of functionality per item. Maybe that isn\u2019t a perfect way to frame it in one sentence but what it does is takes all the properties and generalizes them as much as possible so we can apply gameplay components onto them or any item regardless of its entity type.<br /><br />What we are doing is taking the Lumberyard engine from being a purely entity driven engine to being a componentized system, meaning you can share components between different items or entities so you don\u2019t have to write bespoke code for every single entity.<br /><br />An animated object within Lumberyard was an entity and that had a certain set of properties so of the big ones being a model, animations and some physics. All of these were written in terms of the item entity so instead to componentize that and move that entity from an item 1.0 to an item 2.0 you would have to decouple all of those properties from the entity itself. So you turn it into an item first of all but it cannot do anything by itself, we call it a game object, it\u2019s just a concept of a container waiting for components.<br /><br />The first component I add is the geometry component, something which can be shared across pretty much any item. Then you might have an animation component which would be added to the same item and at this point we almost have the same entity in a componentized way. We have to write all those components up, so the conversion is a slow one as we have to slowly removing all the bespoke entities from Lumberyard and turning them into a componentized system.<br /><br />EKD: Which allows for some really exciting gameplay implications because once you have things in this way there are more interesting things you can do with them. Which is a large part of the gameplay aspect of what we are making is, utilizing that level of granularity which is really cool.<br /><br />ST: It also just makes things easier to make, by far. The geometry component was the most obvious one right out of the gate, so that was the first one we wrote. Now we can assign geometry to any item through this one component, this one block of code that applies to everything. Rather than whole separate entities dealing with their things independently and if we change something we have to change it across 100,000 different entities, which creates too much work.<br /><br />So one of the other things on top of this is the performance it brings us and the ability to optimize. When you have so many entities with so many different properties you have a hard job doing large scheduling updates. What we can do with these components is make an entity scheduler and make it update the component so many times per frame or if an item has a geometry component that\u2019s over 10 feet away say don\u2019t updated that one. It is these kind of optimizations we can make in a component based system that is the whole reasoning behind doing it.", "title": "Exclusive Star Citizen Interview With Sean Tracy & Eric Kieron Davis", "source": "https://youtu.be/xGV2996y4Jk", "time": "9m49s", "type": "youtube", "user": "Oliver East", "transcript": "http://www.justpushstart.com/2017/03/exclusive-star-citizen-interview-sean-tracy-eric-kieron-davis-full-transcript/3/", "published_at_timestamp": 1490484602}, {"objectID": "373672150", "question": "When will we be able to hire NPC as crew, will it be at first when they appear?", "answer": "For 3.0 no, they're still working on some of the NPC elements of having them interact with you and have them be more than just a person filling the seat.

'I know it has been mentioned that clothing / character equipment will have an item port system, somewhat similar to ships. Can you give us any examples using specific clothing and other equipment? For example, will pockets serve as item ports, and not just be cosmetic? Will wearing a pocketed vest over coverall spacesuit increase the number of items, small enough to fit the pocket of course one can carry? Also, can one have a holster for a pistol sized weapon, not just on a belt, but between a shirt or a trenchcoat, or strapped to a space suit?Jeremiah Lee: So the way, I hope I'm right but, I know I'm right... I think I'm right...WW: Well, this is your current thinking on the subject, subject to change...JL: Yes, but, from what we have currently is that each suit or each clothing have a specific item slot. Now, we can't say that oh, if my heavy marine chestpiece, chest plate, has eight slots, then I can stuff eight pistols, like that's not how it's going to work right? So, each item slot will be specific for a specific size or a specific type of item. So, for instance, instead of having six magazines, maybe you want six medpens for instance. Like, the question that Johnny_71 asked, for in the case of a medic, right, so that's how we're going to do our item slots, and so when it comes to layer clothing though, it's still in the works. So that's not... we're not quite sure how we're going to tackle that necessarily, like dusters and stuff. we don't have space cowboys...WW: Yeah, trying to figure out how pockets are going to work. I mean, it would be nice if there was a reason why you change out of your t-shirt and jeans into work clothes, because they provide you with extra storage for, you know to put on that tool belt before you went out to go do your repair job, so I mean I think that's kind of an interesting layer and you know, hopefully factoring in possibly how NPCs react to based on what you're wearing is something we've started to look at potentially, so walking around town in your full armour might get you slightly different reactions than walking around in your sweet sweet leather coat.JL: And I don't think we're going to necessarily approach it like kinda how MMORPG's kind of treat it, like you have 36 item slots and so you can carry six bazookas, and you're wearing them like a jacket, like, I mean, it doesn't really make sense so, we're still fleshing that part out but I think the vision that we have is those item slots are kind of locked for specific item types and sizes.WW: Cause the way you're designing it is like, is everything visible right now?JL: Yes.WW: So like if you have three grenades, you can actually see those three grenades on yourself, so I think that's going to carry over to a lot of things, like maybe you'll have a backpack if you want to carry around a lot of stuff, but umm... that's really, I'm really excited about that, that you'll be able to see it being depleted on a guy, or being able to eye check an enemy and know if they have grenades.JL: Right. 'Do you have any weapons on you?' and have like six grenades. 'Noooooo'.Both: [laugh]JL: Like, the way we have the marine set up right now is we have the magnetic attachment points, and you can actually see those magnetic attachment points, it was so hard to place them in the right areas, and to look cool at the same time, but literally we have specific magnets to match specific items, so... like for instance we might have grenades on the right side, and the magazines on your waist, and the holster for your gun on your right thigh I think, so we have specific magnetic points, especially for the military. Yeah.WW: It's interesting. Something that looks kind of neat and futuristic in real life, like you know, a gun being stuck onto a chest or stuck onto a leg, looks really kind of fake in videogames because it's so easy just to stick junk onto a character, so like when you see... so it's definitely a careful balance to make it look and feel good.JL: Exactly...", "published_at_timestamp": 1452554872, "question": "I have similar questions about the item ports system for clothing/gear.

It's not going to be in 2.0 it will come when we bring the newer refactored items to the table which is likely to be probably 2.2 I would think.

The difference is if you're in orbit around Earth for example, there might be thousands of people around there, so there might be 100 people per instance and 1000 players, there might be 10 different instances supporting them, which could potentially be at different places around Earth. If you're one of those players you'll never really be able to see ALL the players around Earth at once, and the people you DO see will be those that are friends, POI's or enemies.

We have seen everything from light filled \"tunnels\" that you surf, ala the Wing Commander movie, Stargate, or Freelancer, to streaking stars in Star Wars and Star Trek. Do you plan something visually along those lines, or do you have a unique artistic twist up your sleeve that you don't mind sharing with us?", "answer": "We're actually taking an early look at the jump-point worm-hole travel. We have two basic forms of fast-travelling in space at the moment, the first is jump-hole travel, so you go through a fold in space, and the second is Quantum travel which is the \"in system\" fast travel where your ship goes into a fast-mode. One way to look at why the engines on the back of your ship are so large compared to the little manoeuvring thrusters is that their primary function is to get you into Quantum travel which is about .2c or a little faster. You can only do Quantum drive in a straight line, we have a cool mechanic planned for that, including engaging or avoiding engagements while travelling. The drives will take some time to power up before you reach Quantum travel, and you've got to be lined up with the destination, and stay lined up for a certain time or distance. The engines are creating a massive gravitational field for you to reach those speeds, which requires a lot of power so you might be vulnerable considering you're not dodging fire either. Anyone that gets in front of you might be able to break your quantum drive build-up too. That's our in-system fast travel anyway.Jump point travel is used to get to completely new systems/areas of space, and the idea we've talked about here is kind of like surfing a huge wave like on the north shore of Hawaii, so it's like time and space moving around inside this wave or tunnel, with holes into regular space and other potential obstacles making it challenging to navigate for the first time. We're also thinking that over time the navigation data of a jump point might become out of date and need to be re-mapped manually. Some might be very stable and last a long time, where others might be so unstable the data is pretty much only good for that one jump, so might need to always be navigated manually. There are some that support bigger ships where there might be a jump point that's small and unstable enough that you really need a manoeuvrable ship small enough to go through, which might get you somewhere others can't get to or at least could give you a shortcut over a longer, more stable route.

If you're navigating the jump point for the first time it's definitely pretty dangerous, you'll almost have to surf it, like you're trying to stay on the warp-wave until you've ridden it out at the other end of the rip in the space-time continuum. Once you've done that you'll have the transitional effect as I mentioned before, but it's the same effect you just don't need to pilot it yourself.

(I would assume there is more light aka cheap models in circulation than heavy).", "answer": "Right in front of me I don't have all the numbers, but definitely the Aurora is by far the biggest... you know, there's more Auroras than anything else by quite a lot. I would say Auroras probably make up something like 60 or 70 percent of the actual ships and pledges out there. Then beyond that, it's sort of, the next highest one is the 300i, then it's followed by the Hornet, then it's followed by the Freelancer, then it's followed by the Constellation. So, errr... I dunno... I would say there's probably... well, maybe 60 or 70 percent was high for the Aurora, but I would definitely say there was two, two-and-a-half times as many Auroras as there were 300is.But having said that, when you ask \"will these numbers factor in with the economic model?\" yes, they will because we're gonna be designing the economy in such a way that all ships have to be produced. And so the simplest ships - so the Auroras - will be produced in much more volume than, say, a much rarer ship - something like an Idris corvette. And so once you're flying around in the game, obviously the Auroras would probably be plentiful, in terms of being able to buy them in the same way that probably getting a Ford Fiesta is plentiful, or, you know, some sort of not particularly expensive or fancy car. And it will factor in... so therefore the numbers of them from our standpoint hopefully will correlate through, in terms of for what people have now and also kinda the frequency or rarity that they are in the game.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 35 (2014.08.25)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Uyur8rqbEHc", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Qanniqtuq", "published_at_timestamp": 1409004035}, {"objectID": "373683950", "question": "Will we be able to scale the output and cap the max output of any individual or set of thrusters on the fly?So when I slam on my joysick, instead of the thruster firing at full force, it maxes out at whatever I told it to?", "answer": "Yeah, that's a pretty good question, we definitely have the ability to change the power to the thrusters on either an individual basis or a group basis, and the power to the thruster also controls how much the thruster can fire. So I would say probably yes.I don't know if you necessarily can dial the amount of thrust you want out of it, but that would be pretty interesting. It would be something that potentially I think we may play with, 'cause I sort of...I mean I guess this is really saying \"I would like to balance my ship a little differently,\" which I think should be allowable, to some level. So you can definitely right now change the power distribution to any of the thrusters.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 25.

And we think that would make it interesting, like a mountain pass. Some mountain passes are big and you can fit a lot of people through, and some are small and you can only fit one through the craggy little pathway.So yes, we are definitely doing that, we haven't fully figured out what are the pros and cons of what classifies jump points that way or what the situations are, but that's part of our thinking to make space traversal more interesting.Maybe an info runner, a smaller ship, can get a more direct route because they can go through some smaller, unstable jump points that a really big ship can't get through. So it would make for interesting gameplay.", "title": "10 for the Chairman - Episode 16 .

CryEngine already has multi-threading in it, so it runs the renderer in a separate render thread...It runs a separate render thread, it runs the physics in actually several CPU threads, animations run in another CPU thread, the main game loops in another game thread, I think we've got networking in another thread.So in general the engine is already fairly multi-threaded, and longer term we're working at adding in, doing more of that, to take advantage of it, because that's just the way modern day PCs are going. It's less about faster clock speed, and more about more CPUs.Memory, definitely, the more memory the better. We'll be able to pre-cache more, and you'll have higher resolution textures. If we're running low on the memory side, you would probably reduce the textures, where as if you have 16-32 GB, you may get them at the full 4k resolution in some cases, or there'll be less disc loading, so we'll be able to pre-cache more into memory.So I would definitely recommend having a multi-core CPU and lots of memory.Most of my machines all have 32 GB or more. I think you're gonna have to, 'cause there's a lot of developments we have, lots of applications open at once, and usually we've got 6 core or 8 core machines here.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 12 (2014.03.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/-3KIcnKf3O0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Mateu", "published_at_timestamp": 1395093621}, {"objectID": "373685570", "question": "When are the Christmas decorations coming down? ;)", "answer": "Yeah, I know, we've been pretty tardy on getting those Christmas decorations down because it's February now.

I mean my goal actually is for the NPCs in the game to sort of feel and appear much like real people so in some ways I almost sort of feel like until you get up close I kind of don't want the players to really even know that it's an NPC or a player and therefore the NPCs, we're already designing a bunch of behavior for them and part of that plan is to have human like responses like to preserve their own lives and that kind of stuff so I would definitely say that you will be able to say \"Give us your cargo or pay the consequences\" and some people will fight you and some people will just surrender their cargo and get out.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 05 (2014.01.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/RtyZzO5OrE0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Valerian", "published_at_timestamp": 1389982600}, {"objectID": "ff08393540f63_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Is the center of mass constant for each hull or does it vary depending on what modules you've installed or in your cargo bay?", "answer": "It varies", "user": "Forss", "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12grru/i_am_chris_roberts_creator_of_wing_commander/c6uw9sq/", "published_at_timestamp": 1351771200, "title": "r/IAmA: Chris Roberts", "type": "reddit"}]
