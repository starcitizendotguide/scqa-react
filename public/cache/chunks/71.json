Are you confident that this one will come quickly?", "answer": "Of course, static server meshing included ALL the technology development. So the low-level code that deals with the network: transmission of packets that are reliable vs. those that are unreliable, all this technology has been rewritten for server meshing. Then the concept of authority, where we're in the process of ironing out all the bugs linked to the transfer of authority, i.e. when you change servers, all the game components must respond to this change of authority.<br/><br/>There are a lot of elements that were badly done at the time, or done unnecessarily, that need to be dealt with. And we're dealing with that right now.<br/><br/>To continue on the subject of server meshing, we're talking about massive transfers of authority. Let's take a large Microtech mesh in its entirety, and decide to bring in a server to look after New Babagge alone. So here we're doing mass transfers of authority that will bring all the transfers to the new server, part of the dynamic meshing development, plus the reconciliation loop that will look at where the players are, where there's a need for servers, and which will distribute the server needs to best serve the players.<br/><br/>That means not only grouping them together, because there's a cost dimension involved. Of course, if we could give each player a server, we'd do it haha!<br/><br/>To sum up, there's less development to be done with dynamic than with static. I hope we'll be able to do this quickly, but already in 4.0 there are certain elements of dynamic meshing that are implemented in the code. That means the ability to switch servers on and off depending on whether there are players or not.<br/><br/>We're trying to make sure we have this same flexibility in 4.0 (internally we call it \u201calmost-dynamic\u201d for a lack of better words haha).

With all of these things benefitting the PU, which players may see.<br7>One of the things we say that server performance was actually pretty good, but when we scaled it up to about 5x our previous smaller tests, we saw we had some issues with the matchmaker which was down to some of the logic in there.

We're still working on the whole sea guys. Yeah, the whole sea's definitely improved, the only reason why it actually wasn't put in as a task there was because there is a technical issue with the interior grids because the whole sea contracts and then expands away 100%, the art's finished, it's going to be in the game, but the bit where we were contracting and explaining the interior grid, which isn't like, we don't know how to do it, or it's a year task or anything, it's not at all, it just doesn't have a resource currently assigned to do that, and so they didn't want to expose that epic on the roadmap until they had that and then it was done, so that's kind of what's happening right now is that we've sort of switched our development methodology to be much, especially on Star Citizen, to be sort of more date driven, but we've also switched how we're running the teams internally to be much more agile team based, so before we were more pipeline based, the programmers had a list of all the things they were working on, the designers had a list of things they were working on, the artists had... And we still have some pipeline aspects like the ships, weapons, characters are pretty much a pipeline, but in terms of feature development, we've changed it around so we're building agile teams where you have the engineer and the designer and the artists that will be helping and supporting that all sort of embedded together working on the feature, and that is fairly different than how we were doing it previously where a lot of it was the engineer was given... We had a TD, here's the task we need from engineering, they would go and work it, here's the things design needs to do once we get the engineering, here's the thing we need from the artists, and there's communication and friction that happens in that so this is much more about having the small team agile style working, but that does mean that we change how we're utilizing JIRA, which is our project management task tool that we use, from a more... a bit set up more like a pipeline, especially for the engineering design, to more of the team task user story based, which is where we're going to. Now we did a little bit of it last year towards the end, but now we're doing it across, it's going to be exactly the same for every single studio across the company, and everyone's fully on board with that, we have all our senior production right now over in the UK, I think that will be in Germany next week, working and finishing these out, and the idea is that we... because we're updating the roadmap like we did for 3.0 where every Friday was always just a big song and dance because we had things in JIRA, but we were displaying them this other way, and then there was the longer term roadmap, had so much stuff in it that the production was so busy doing other stuff they didn't really have time to maintain it, so it totally got out of date, so they were updating the stuff that was for 3.0 but not later, and it just was a lot of extra work, so we decided we wanted to essentially expose our project management software, the JIRA stuff, to the website, so Turbulent built that whole roadmap tool, it basically takes it via the JIRA roadmap, and we have settings inside our epics that we can say this is a public epic, and then we can put user facing descriptions, and we can even add user pictures, so production development can just, when they set up the epic that they're working on, they can set it up also for the public facing, and it scrubs automatically into it, so the advantage of that is we don't have to manually update anything because there's lots of mistakes when you're manually updating stuff, so everything will just reflect the state of the tool that we're using to manage everyone across the company. Of course we're not showing every single task because there's thousands of tasks, and the information's overwhelming, so we sort of show the very high level, what you would call an epic, or in some cases sort of a saga, which is overwhelming, over quite a few epics. I know they have all these sorts of epics, sagas, stories, tasks.<br/><br/>JH: It's like Joseph Campbell designed the JIRA.<br/><br/>CR: Yeah, so we expose those, and we mark which ones are public facing. We wanted to get the roadmap in people's hands, which is why we went live with it here, but they still have organization work to do because they've got to take the way JIRA was set up before. Some of it's been done, not all of it's been done, so they have to change it around because they've got to organize under the right epics and everything. So in the case where they don't feel comfortable that they don't have it organized properly in this duplicate task, because sometimes there were tasks set up from before, but now we're setting it up on this new one, so in those cases they just choose not to show that epic publicly until they have it in shape, and so you'll see that roadmap will get more things added to it. Of course, things also will move around a little bit as maybe a bit more information comes to light, or how it's going, but that's the beauty of it. It's going to be 100% live reflection of the tool that we use to manage all the tombs, and we're using exactly the same process on Squadron 42, which is going to get me to answer the original question, which is are you going to get the roadmap like that? I can't remember the original question. And yes, we will. If you look on the side, there's a Star Citizen logo. There will be a Squadron 42 logo. You get the roadmap. So once we have the Squadron 42 tasks and epics all cleaned up and ready to go, then we will also turn that on and share it. It may not be done on a quarterly. It may be done on a monthly. I'm not quite sure. We're still discussing kind of the column format for it, but it will, again, scrub live from all the tasks that we have and epics and sagas that we have entered for finishing out Squadron 42.", "title": "Star Citizen: Reverse the Verse LIVE - Squadron 42 Q&A", "source": "https://youtu.be/fS6FpCpt5m4", "type": "youtube", "published_at_timestamp": 1517055120}, {"objectID": "947637760", "title": "Calling All Devs - aUEC, Hotfixes and More", "question": "What are the plans for adding aUEC transfers between players?", "source": "https://youtu.be/fJcfJOj1-a8", "type": "youtube", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "time": "2m3s", "answer": "", "published_at_timestamp": 1516649889}, {"objectID": "1e5b4f3d912a61_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "While we considered this in its early design stages, the Nova does not have any alternative modes, and instead stays focused in a single configuration.", "published_at_timestamp": 1513897200, "question": "Does it have a 'deployable mode'?

What\u2019s going to happen when the ship hits the atmosphere they thrusters are going to keep the flight model the same except the external forces are still acting on it like drag and lift are now a lot more obvious but the model itself hasn\u2019t changed. We have actually have a guy with a Phd.<br /><br />EKD: A very smart guy<br /><br />ST: we stare at his screen of formulas and bar charts. He [John Pritchett] is our flight programmer and he\u2019s been on the project from the start.<br /><br />EKD: The complicated maths behind the newtonian physics and that model. That brings back to the simulation as much as we possibly can. What would actually happen if you take this ship into atmosphere.<br /><br />ST: So to answer more clearly, the shape of the ship will absolutely effect how it handles in atmosphere, but it\u2019s not due to a different flight model. More because those external variables are different, less drag because it\u2019s more aerodynamic, more lift because it has wings and more like that.<br /><br />We constantly clash in terms of its a game thing that happens in game development of what happens in reality and what\u2019s just a game part of it. John hates the hand wavey game stuff. He\u2019s like \u201cNoooo that\u2019s not how it would work\u201d the the G-Force conversations are just none stop. There\u2019s a way we do it in games that is fun and feel s cool and then there is the reality of what it would do to you. You definitely have to come to a balance but it is nice to have the accuracy of someone that understands it in the real world.<br /><br />EKD: It is nice to see that level of passion in each person\u2019s individual aspect of what is Star Citizen. Everybody you interact with in their field or thing that is exactly how the conversations go. The passion is deep and rich and it is a discussion you have to have and then ultimately we get to what you get to play but it is across the board with everyone.", "title": "Exclusive Star Citizen Interview With Sean Tracy & Eric Kieron Davis", "source": "https://youtu.be/xGV2996y4Jk", "time": "14m34s", "type": "youtube", "user": "Oliver East", "transcript": "http://www.justpushstart.com/2017/03/exclusive-star-citizen-interview-sean-tracy-eric-kieron-davis-full-transcript/3/", "published_at_timestamp": 1490484602}, {"objectID": "373686510", "question": "With the recent progress update on the Prospector, is it safe to assume that we will have ship based mining to some degree with the launch of 3.0?", "answer": "CR: So the quick answer is yes it is something that we\u2019re absolutely trying to achieve. So we think we\u2019ll be able to do some version of basic mining by 3.0, may not be the final more sophisticated\u2026<br /><br />TZ: Yeah, I would say we\u2019re shuffling... the full set we\u2019re looking at what we can trade off, what would be more interesting to the player community, what naturally falls out given the development trajectory. What we can pull in a bit more easily than what we originally though and you know at the same time what\u2019s basically a little more difficult so we\u2019re shuffling some of the 3.1, 3.0, 3.2 things around.<br /><br />CR: Maybe move some stuff around cause when we first talked about 3.0 sort of last half of last year, we originally had in mind a simpler set of functionality and features that we were going to do. Once we sat down and said, well if we\u2019re doing this we kind of need to do this, we kind of need to do this and it ended up being a lot more stuff to really deliver. Basically it was like anyone else\u2019s ship in game, functionality and I think I said it before but we started with like\u2026 so what we put up on the cards was this much and now we got confluence pages of like this much at least four or five times as many of the systems and features than we were originally thinking. So what\u2019s happened is that obviously means 3.0 is taking a bit longer than we were thinking. It also means that certain things like when ships are available and some of the professions we thought we could get to, we may move things around because some of the stuff\u2026 mining\u2019s an example of this, some of the stuff will have equipment like ships, whether it be salvage or mining or whatever before. So, mining is definitely one that is on our radar and would like do it because it\u2019s kind of a basic\u2026 it\u2019s a resource collection profession and could really feed into the ecosystem.<br /><br />TZ: We\u2019re looking to trade that one for some other stuff, I think that there\u2019s a lot of players that would very much appreciate that type of game play versus some of the other stuff that we talked about being in 3.0. I think that it would actually give us a much more well rounded set of professions\u2026 initial professions. I would also point out that you mentioned how we\u2019re thinking about it in a little bit more\u2026 little bit larger terms in terms of the sum total of functionality that you\u2019ll be able to engage in. The initial tier of stuff is actually\u2026 there\u2019s an entire tier of functionality that we think we can actually get to and like you said it\u2019s not the entire mining experience but it\u2019s still going to give players a whole lot of interesting gameplay.<br /><br />CR: Yeah, definitely.", "title": "Star Citizen: 10 for the Chairman - Professions in Alpha 3.0", "source": "https://youtu.be/Uhra2SETLNs", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Kenzi Snow", "time": "40m10s", "published_at_timestamp": 1489533309}, {"objectID": "b2a6cb681ea76_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Yes, losing your airshields while in space would have the same effect as a hull decompression event.

One of the design objectives that people are working on now that we sort of got persistence in is the whole idea of control locking safety on your ship, cause right now you can just fly up to someone else's ship and open up it's back door and go inside. Which obviously doesn't make a vast amount of sense especially when we have persistent ships and there's real value to them. So, one of the next stages of stuff will be to put the kind of security systems in place, this partly comes with this item 2.0 stuff that we're talking about where you can control various items. An item will be a door, an airlock and you can sort of lock things down or shut it or open up to a friend if he was to arrive.Then comes with that is other levels of boarding mechanics like how you would break into a ship if you wanted to get into it and someone has locked it up. You know, whether it's hacking the lock or blowing open a door, so all that is sort of in the early stages of getting fleshed out and then will get implemented and, of course, part of that would also involve notification to your Mobiglass if you were say EVAing up somewhere else within... obviously within a reasonable amount of range it would tell you, 'hey look, someone's trying to break into your ship'.

That's one of the things the Hornet Tracker is particularly well suited for. What's described here is 2 different systems, there's the targeting system and the comms system. The hornet tracker for example is very good at detecting and targeting other ships, then transmitting that information to your ship. So if you have this ship on your radar, and I do not, you can fix that.Matthew Sherman: Like you're saying that with comms, if a hornet tracker has the advantage with detecting and tracking targets, it might not be the best with communicating that, so if there was an allied herald for example, that'll be a much better communications ship, so you would want the tracker to send the info to the herald, then the herald sends its out to the rest of the fleet.

We haven't decided yet, because we haven't really gotten into that.We still got obviously a lot of performance things to figure out. Like how many NPCs we can have running in the same area or instance as well as how many players can run in the same area or instance. So, we wouldn't want to have an infinite amount for people doing in there. There's a certain level you don't want to have that cause it can become incredibly unbalanced. So, I don't have a great answer for that right now, but I would say it not going to be as many as theoretically you could allow. There will be some level of cap on it, but it will be what would make sense for you to have some help in the cases you need and, perhaps different things would have different amounts.So, if you have an Idris then you and some friends need to fly but you also need a bit of a crew and that could maybe have a few more NPCs in that situation than  you would if you were hiring individual NPCs to fly escorts.  So, you couldn't have 10 NPCs flying 10 Hornets for instance.

So, while the production coordinator for the tech design and engineering team. It's not my job to know how to do coding, or how to do engineering or necessarily know how to do tech design, I just need to make sure they have the resources they need, make sure the information is being correctly funneled to them. Now, ultimately what can cause a bottleneck is something like lack of communication or what else would you consider...Kirk Tome: That is the priority number one, communication is the most important thing that a producer can provide any employee...DV: Right.KT: In development, we need to keep those channels open and ensure that everyone knows what they need to do and are expected to do. That way we don't have issues where, 'hey, I didn't know that Jimmy over here was supposed to be doing this. I've been waiting for him to finish this other task, which prevents me from implementing thing I wanted to do...'DV: Right.KT: So, communication is absolutely number one.DV: A good producer will be able to keep their team in the loop at all times, an excellent producer will be able to preemptively predict what obstacles are coming down the road. Be able to foresee what things down the road are going to bottleneck, such as knowing what the other teams are working on. For example, we have Mark Hong, who is our art and animation producer, so if I am working on a particular feature as a producer... my goal is I want to be able to talk to Mark and find out what he's working on. See how what he's going to do is going to effect what Kirk's team is coming or is doing down the road.So if we see Kirk is working on a particular component for a ship, if I find out from Mark early on that that ship is going to be delayed or the art isn't coming along as quickly as possible it's my responsibility to provide that information to Kirk say, \"Hey, we have a little more cushion time as far as that particular ship so if you have something else you need to work on, some low hanging fruit that you want to complete in the meantime\". That's where the producer comes and lets these guys know, that's what's available.As far as specialization, it's useful to be able to talk to those developers at an educated level, like I said before you don't need to know how to program but at least know what those programmers are doing and what they're working towards. Same thing with tech design, we necessarily don't need to know everything about game balance but we need to know what their objective is and how do producers help them to complete that objective.KT: From a developer's standpoint, it is my responsibility to inform producers as far as the things they do need to know about that particular task so they can make an educated choices about scheduling and task party, etc. At the same time, when I do need to talk to say one of the artists or animators directly, it should be part of my duties to inform the producer in charge of that particular individual that that is happening that way they can ensure that maybe a higher priority task should take precedence or they know to follow up on that task in the near future and we can all figure out... hey, were you along that timeline, are we getting close to being done because this person is waiting on that. So, juggling tasks and figuring what priorities of things is the resource we use from the production team.DV: So, it's kind of a nitty gritty behind the scenes look at game development, it's not the most romantic or glamorous type of question but it is one that's important. That's why we wanted to address it, there are things that go on behind the scenes that help streamline a lot of these things other than just making pretty ships and cool levels.", "published_at_timestamp": 1456181823, "question": "Do the producers specialize on a game aspect or do you need to know 'everything' about that game?", "source": "https://youtu.be/OsA8rglWoEU", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 06", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Perry_Hope", "time": "19m58s"}, {"objectID": "373679590", "question": "Will the procedurally-generated environments be the same for everyone, or will the system generate entirely new terrain each time we visit a world?", "answer": "Uh no, they will be the same for everyone. The key about procedural generation is deterministic. You start with a seed or a number of seeds which are generally numbers and those numbers drive all the formulas that would create the terrain, the oceans, the forests, all the rest of the stuff.The beauty of that system means as long as all the players share the same same seed which they will, they can dynamically generate that world that will be identical on their machine to someone else's machine on the server and that's the ruleset of how procedural generation works. If you think about it it's almost an incredibly efficient compression algorithm. Say maybe 5 numbers can generate this huge world with all this detail on it. That's definitely how No Man's Sky works, that's definitely how Eve works, that's definitely how infinity battlescape works and it is the way ours does.The world, one you visit it will always look the same so procedural generation is just how the world was created from this small subset of variables, but it will always after those variables have been established look the same other changes that are enacted on it by a player. So if someone is mining somewhere and were taking away part of the rocks then that would be a delter on the actual base procedural planet which the delta would have to be shared to the other player. We're longer term planning to do that, but shorter term we wouldn't have players be able to do much modification to the planets just because you don't want to be carrying too much data around.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 74", "source": "https://youtu.be/qqcN6UkKfog", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Banjo", "published_at_timestamp": 1451947767}, {"objectID": "373681560", "question": "Any tips for setting realistic time frames, especially when dealing with something the team hasn't done before (sounds like a lot of the netcode work and server tech is pretty uncharted waters)? Would you consider it better to work in a certain amount of flexible time to the initial schedule for when things (seemingly inevitably) run over, or is it more like a plan runs off track and you start fresh from where you are now?", "answer": "Darian Vorlick: This is pure production work right here. Our job is to create those calendars. One of the things Lisa has is a calendar of all ship development, and the interesting thing about production, is the moment you make a calendar, it's immediately out of date. Because things, reality happens. Things change. People's schedules change. Resources become available or don't.Lisa Ohanian: It's more of a living document. You change it and you update it every day. There are definitely periods, especially early on, we give a little more flex time. And then as we flesh things out, we can predict a little bit better, usually, against other ships we've done. I've definitely seen situations where we have ship concepts coming down the line, and we know that some of them are going to have some new unique functionality, we're going to have to flesh out the gameplay that comes along with that, and we'll talk to marketing about this and we'll say hey look, we can't predict this ship for this time, but probably around this period. And they'll say okay, well, let's see how that progresses. And then as things flesh out, we'll decide which ship to plug into that date depending on how it goes.Luckily we have a good marketing team who's willing to be reactive. When some ships come in early or, more often, a little bit late...DV: On top of that, a lot of the tech is very similarly related. For example, we'll use one of our animators, Mark McCall. If he has to animate a gun shooting, and the new ship that we're working on has a very similar gun, if historically it's taken him 3 days to animate it, then we know roughly that it's going to take three days to animate this other weapon. So, at least we have a ball-park estimate of what time frame it's going to take.Now, if it's something that's completely new and unprecedented, let's say we need to create some kind of instant repair beam or something, that's not an actual feature I'm just hypothetically throwing it out there...LO: Yeah I was thinking that someone's like, 'What is that?'DV: If it's something we've never done before, what we do as the producers, we ask those developers 'How long do you think it'd take to make this?' and we get their feedback. If we went to a designer they might say, 'Okay, it might take me a day to come up with a concept, another day to write the full design brief on it, and then maybe art may take two days,' so we kind of get their buy-in on how long it'll take, and we just update our schedule as we hit those dates.LO: And we always try to ask them even if we do think there's something similar that we can compare to, because our job isn't to create any of this, it's to facilitate everything. And you never know when we're going to say hey, this weapon's a lot like this one, so it'll probably take three days right, and Mark's like, hold on, no, you didn't account for the fact that we haven't done this yet, or it's on this kind of ship which is totally different, so we always, every single thing we have to check and check in again.DV: Another interesting point is that, as we go through more and more ships, we learn the processes as we go. So, one process, if we see that historically it has taken three days to do a certain type of feature, we're going to become more and more efficient as we go through, so what might have taken three days historically, we may have it down so pat that it only may take a day and a half to two days. So, it's one of the other advantages of having producers on hand, and also keeping these schedules up to date. We see the trend of how long it's taken before versus how long it's taking now, we can see where those increases are, where we need to give more time versus less time.LO: And that's, we're seeing that on the component pipeline right now.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 11", "source": "https://youtu.be/9y1X4tLFdU0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Gravy", "published_at_timestamp": 1439849467}, {"objectID": "373682000", "question": "What signs do you look for indicating feature creep has begun to infiltrate into the production of a game?

So can I backwards forwards on your questions. Yes, absolutely, right? We have a backlog of everything. Everything that's come up in any meeting we try to capture. We have this massive, as much as we possibly could...DV: Sky's the limit ideas.EKD: Sky's the limit. Those blue sky ideas, scope. Just go to town. You always want to encourage folks to get that out of their head. It gets excited, \"Well what if it could do this, and this, and this.\" We've all done this, growing up as kids with our... we make things up when we play. You know we all do this, we have imagination. So we do encourage that, we want that to happen. And then we capture that in the backlog and then we take that backlog and that's when we would filter out future sprints or future milestones or future deliverables, whatever word you want to use. For us it's future releases. When we come up with a patch, we've got a few patch plans coming up and what we'd like to come out in that patch. So we definitely do this, frequently, all the time. What have we done to ensure on Star Citizen? That's a good question. Because we're doing something new. We've got a lot of great backers and subscribers that are helping us make this. And we want to do something really cool and we want to do something really big. And something unique.DV: No shortage of ideas.EKD: And no shortage of ideas. So we are constantly as producers working with this blue sky idea and then trying to put it in reality. So we can actually get something out for us all to play and have fun with. This is a challenge. This is a real challenge for us. And we're every day, I mean today, we had meetings about things that we're like, \"Oh that's a great idea, but it's out of scope.\" How can we still get this out and then maybe make version two or three or four of it. I think I saw this on one of the questions I don't think we're answering today was, \"How do you say okay we're done we got a thing out we want to play it and now we'll iterate on it.\" And you'll see this with people that sell their games for consoles and then you go to play it and there's a 500mb patch immediately. That was the same thing, they had to get it out, they went gold master, they got out the product. And they're like, \"But we got all this other stuff we wanted to fix or get out there.\" And I think that's kind of just the way now with this constant downloading, streamable world we live in. It's actually a reality without impeding our player base or our wonderful fans or our wonderful folks that are playing our game. So we're balancing that. We're always trying to balance that. So how are we ensuring it? By just looking at the schedules, the realisticness of our schedules and nature of our dates. How to get things out quickly and make sure people are having fun with this. And then we try to be realistic in every meeting we go to. Every time we bring it up we always are the reminder like, \"Hey guys we're still trying to shoot to get this done Friday. What do we need to do to do that?\"DV: A lot of times producers have to be the bad guy that just says, \"No. We can't do this for now. Maybe later, but right now. No.\"EKD: Yeah and a lot of times people understand, they'll work with us on that. We'll raise it up as a red flag again like I said before and usually people are like, \"Okay, okay you're right. We can't, that's not realistic without working 24/7.\" Which as much as we all want to do this because we love this project. It's not physically or humanly possible.DV: And you hate curbing... brilliant suggestions. Especially when you have a lot of visionaries like Chris, Ben, Dan, everybody who contributes to the design of this game. You have such a collection of brilliant designers and ideas that it's really hard to say, \"No we can't do this one right now. Let's do it later.\" Because you want to incorporate them all because like the designers, we want to see this thing happen.EKD: Yeah, that's right. And to answer your question about do we already have a green light for post. Yeah, we have an idea of.. you know we want to release this stuff at this time frame. But we still want to put this other stuff in. Based on what we did in our initial kickstarter versus what we're still fundraising. We're looking at okay how can we continue to release those past our original schedule or roadmap.DV: Yeah we've got some long term stuff roadmapped out.EKD: There you go.DV: And those roadmaps will change, probably each patch.

Are certain tracks of work more predictable than others?", "answer": "Eric Kieron Davis: Fantastic question and a good producer question as well. Yes, I would say what this comes down to is the more comfortable you are with the team and the decision makers of your team will help kinda guide this. For me, for scheduling a big part is try to capture as much as I possibly can. Right so, it's one thing just to say, you know, you talk to an artist or a developer and you say how much time is X going to take and they'll say five days. You go, great, five days. Throw that in there but there are some things that go around that like, does that five days include just work, desktime, no meetings, cranking through work. Does that include iteration with your lead, with your supervisor, with, you know, our entire stakeholders...Travis Day: The art director, Chris...EKD: That's right. Does it include any kind of other buffers we might need in any other independent connections and if that's the case then yes, that's the five days I schedule and then we can schedule the whole thing out that way, if we understand our mass amount of work. Like you said, when we're not necessarily R&Ding and we're kinda in predictability, as much as that word isn't a real thing, it's a thing we try to use, you can get a little better understanding. Once you understand your team, once you understand the decision maker process, once you understand the dynamic and the dichotomy of your group this becomes a little bit better. I think the quote goes: A battle plan goes out the window after the first shot is fired....TD: Yeah, after first contact with the enemy.EKD: Yeah, so every plan does go out the window and as producers our job is to iterate with that plan and those ideas and predictability is a word we don't get to enjoy much in game development. In any entertainment creation, I mean we're not necessarily doing something new but when you're trying to do new stuff you don't necessarily have a business model to follow.TD: Yeah, even if it's just new for the team, new for the people doing it. Actually one of the things you said is a really important point to make, that a lot of people have the impression that, oh, you sit down at the beginning of a project, you lay out your budget for the entirety of the project, you lay out the schedule and then you just sit and you track against that. You're in your ivory tower somewhere and you kinda survey the battlefield...EKD: You don't talk to anybody, you just sit there and watch.TD: It's much more like a World War II sergeant throwing a grenade at the front line, you know, that kinda thing. It's much more moment to moment, I think.EKD: For sure, you know as much as I think we want to be predictable as producers are and scheduling, budgeting, it's just very hard to account for that. So, its a lot of work, a lot of iteration, a lot of communication, and a lot of understanding in how the plan can move. So, once you understand all the players that are involved you can - you know, once I started doing schedules on projects on things I've done in the past, I've done it a few times or I've worked with the same group multiple times, that helps a tremendous amount. Like I know, Tim always does this, Ashley always does this and Fred always does this. I know some of their quirks, great quirks that make them awesome at their job, and it helps me plan better as a producer. So, I hope that answers your question.

IM device, or looking up/pinging your friends, but when you're on a ship you'll be plugged into the ship's comms systems which ties into the rest of the ship-based systems. But when you're not on ship your ship you'll definitely be able to use your Mobiglas as like a futuristic smart-phone, as that's pretty much what it's designed to be.", "title": "10 For the Chairman: Episode 45 (2014.11.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/qXwybQaAbbs", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "ChillZilla", "published_at_timestamp": 1416257116}, {"objectID": "373678410", "question": "Will we be able to watch planetside weather effects from space, or will planets be static art when viewed from space?", "answer": "Good one, we haven't had a discussion about that, but what the plan for is a planet render element. In cryengine rendering is handled by render-elements, so most of the rendering is handled by a geometry rendering element which gets fed vertexes and texture data etc and renders those with lighting and materials. There are other elements, so things like water, ship shields etc are other ones. We're looking at building a high level render element for planets, so we are looking at generating planet surface procedurally for planets that aren't \"designed\", I mean it'd be impractical to have 8k textures for each of the thousands of planets and moons we'll have in game. So there are those with cloud layers, atmospheric haze etc within our graphics pipeline. SO having said that, because we're doing this dynamically the possibility of having weather being dynamic is definitely possible, but it would be something that's pretty interesting. We're already planning to have proper day/night cycles based on where landing sites are at any time, and we'll definitely have some weather effects, so there might be a rainy blade-runner style planet, or a snowy ice planet like Hoth etc. So I guess whether or not those weather effects are actually happening at the time could extend into the view from space in future.

That's a great idea, and I know there are a few long distance rallies like that. It could potentially be fun, I don't know whether it's necessarily a Constellation race, but perhaps. Certainly could be an \"info-runner\" style race. One of the keys of SC is that we're really keen on having a lot of roles to play that aren't sort of the standard trading/fighting ones. That's why we're doing the racing mode, we're looking at things like salvage mechanics/mining mechanics, and info-traders/runners. Even search and recovery, and having all of that makes it a much richer world, and a funner place for people to play, much more varied than you'd had before.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 38 (2014.09.22)", "source": "https://youtu.be/hkZG9cNyuAY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "ChronosViper", "published_at_timestamp": 1411423420}, {"objectID": "373679220", "question": "I was curious if a user hired an NPC in the PU for a specific task and our ship was under attack, what the response of the NPC would be. Will they continue to do their job or anything else that their employer asks at that time based on their individual skill set and level or, become unpredictable, perhaps wanting to give up? How human might they be?", "answer": "Good question. We definitely are going to be setting our NPCs up... I mean, basically the AI that runs the NPCs will be the same AI that runs NPCs not working for you that you may encounter or you may fight. And of course those NPCs all have... we're gonna have things like skill level, experience, sort of morale, whether the panic or not... and so, I think you'll definitely have, you know, you spend more money to hire a hardened veteran - he probably is not gonna freak out in the line of fire. Whereas if you have a rookie that was cheap, perhaps he'll run in middle of a fight. So we'll definitely have some level of AI personality affecting their actions, just like the non-working-for-you NPCs because it's essentially going to be the same set and code base. I think it's kind of cool that maybe you take people in, and as they get more experienced they become more loyal to you, or they become even better fighters. And then if you go and hire NPCs from the work boards or whatever, you'd pay a little more for a more hardened mercenary to be on your wing. Or if you try to cut corners perhaps you'll pay the price when you get attacked by pirates.So I think those are all things that we definitely will have in, and I think will be important to making the world feel real.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 33 (2014.08.11)", "source": "https://youtu.be/XBVkhXGX8iI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Cantara", "published_at_timestamp": 1407796258}, {"objectID": "373683180", "question": "We've been told SC will go for the Hollywood version of space simulation where sound travels through the void. Have you considered having a switch in the game options, where external sounds can be turned off?", "answer": "Yeah, I've talked about this a few times. It definitely isn't that difficult to have the version when you're outside, and the listener and the sound system is outside, you don't really hear any sounds. So that is definitely something we would consider, we HAVE considered it, and probably would put it in, but that's kind of a \"plus item\", let me put it that way. So it's not something that I would hold up other work for, but it'll be something that down the road would be fairly simple to implement, and we probably would want to do for the people that want to feel the sound in space is realistic.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 31 (2014.07.28)", "source": "https://youtu.be/QWWhhg56IoM", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Bear", "published_at_timestamp": 1406584832}, {"objectID": "373685700", "question": "How close will the flight and combat model that we get in December be to the intended finished product? Will the envelope of what we can do be basically set in stone or more of a rough first version that will be getting tons of refinement and tweaks to the flight model as we go?", "answer": "Ok, so this kind of goes back to the question I answered from Obsydian, but the whole point of the Dogfighting Module is to get it out there, to test a whole bunch of things. Our back-end system, whether the flight control model is fun, whether the weapons are balanced correctly, whether it's too overwhelming for our system design and we need it smaller. So as part of that, yes, nothing is going to be fully set in stone. It's going to be our best first guess at what we think is fun and we want to refine it from there. If something is really broken we are obviously going to fix it, hopefully stuff won't be too broken. But I would like everyone out there to realize that the first Dogfighting Module that they get is not it. It's not going to have all the features, it's not going to have all the functionality. It's going to have a limited amount of features and functionality, then it's going to grow over the next year while we're working on the game. So by the time the game's finished, the dogfighting will have been finished and honed. We're just sharing the process really early with all you out there in the community to make a better game. So in that case, as I was answering to Obsydian, that also means the schedule for it may not be an exact science because there's not much point in testing something if we feel like \"Ok, we're not ready to test the multiplayer now,\" because we want to put it on the proper system instead of a hacked-in system. So we'll give it to you all later to test that bit.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 02 (2013.12.13)", "source": "https://youtu.be/qwbU9FG5XlQ", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Dread Pilot Pete", "published_at_timestamp": 1391813687}, {"objectID": "a2af8a1d67aea_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Can you list all the scenarios in which backers will receive the Electro Skin?
