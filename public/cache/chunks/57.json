Because of the scarcity of records on Banu history due to their cultural practice of not documenting the events of the past, little is known about the origins of their food preparation methods. In addition, their vast trade network, love of experimentation, sensitive palates, and ability to digest almost anything have led Banu to integrate ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures into their cuisine over time. There are nevertheless distinct traits that are typical of Banu cooking. Most crucial are the melding of many flavors and textures in a dish, the importance placed on utilizing the entirety of each ingredient in a meal, and the taboo on food waste. </p><br/><h1>CUSTOMS</h1><br/><p>Typically, Banu have one big meal that is eaten alongside other members of their Souli, and then snack throughout the day. The meal is expected to be a show of abundance, with more food than can be eaten in one sitting. Using their hands, each Banu will take food from the display and place it on plates for ease of mixing constituent parts of the meal to personal taste. The meal is then eaten while sitting partially reclined. </p><br/><p>At the end of a meal, the remaining food is left out, and Banu will come back to it during their work shifts to pick up snacks and maintain their energy. Any food left at the end of the day is then added to the <em>onjussu\u00e6</em>, or \"all-flavor\" stew, a dish that is featured at almost every big meal and is normally eaten as an appetizer. It isn't unusual for a Souli to keep a simmering pot of <em>onjussu\u00e6</em> that is rarely emptied all the way, and is replenished with liquid and ingredients as needed. If properly maintained, <em>onjussu\u00e6</em> can be perpetually cooked for decades. </p><br/><p>Serving utensils are not common; food that cannot be grasped is scooped with personal plates or cups that individual Banu are expected to bring to the table. These plates often have handles attached and are wide, round, and slightly bowled so that flavors can mingle at the bottom. Banu take pride in using beautifully decorated plates and cups.  </p><br/><h1>THE NINE TASTES</h1><br/><p>Banu have a very sensitive palate and can detect a wide range of flavors. When filling their plates at the family meal, they seek a balance of what they refer to as <em>biki ndzotayu</em>, or the Nine Tastes: salty, savory, sweet, pungent (acidic/spicy), bitter, hot, cold, soft, and crunchy. The more tastes included in a single bite of a dish, the better it is. One example of this is <em>ofasa</em>, a popular fried treat and staple of Banu food markets. The outside is hot and crunchy, the inside is soft and cool, the <em>ibifissa</em> meat is sweet and salty, and the <em>angafede</em> is bitter and pungent. Having all nine flavors in one bite is seen as efficient and is highly prized. </p><br/><h1>FOOD WASTE TABOO</h1><br/><p>Banu do not have a notion of food waste. Whereas Humans will peel an orange before consuming it, Banu will eat the entire thing, savoring the bitter rind as a part of the experience. A Xi'an will discard the hard shell of a <em>klom.e'a</em>, but a Banu diner will leave it on, enjoying the mouthfeel of crunchy chitin breaking apart against soft, sweet flesh. It is seen as extremely inefficient and wasteful not to use the entirety of all ingredients. If any part of an ingredient doesn't work in a particular meal, it is saved for later and used elsewhere. </p><br/><h1>FOOD AND EATING SOULIS</h1><br/><p>There is a prevailing cultural attitude that things made by expert artisans are superior to anything that can be made by a hobbyist, and this includes meals. Outside of the maintenance of the pot of <em>onjussu\u00e6</em>, there is a strong preference among Soulis to procure ready-made or easily reheatable meals and snacks from Food Soulis, which specialize in making a handful of dishes designed to produce maximum flavor efficiency and very little waste. These meals are either delivered or picked up at large markets.</p><br/><p>Some Soulis have been known to indenture Banu from recently-dissolved Food Soulis to keep everyone fed. Larger Soulis will typically form partnerships with Food Soulis to keep all their members fed, whereas small Soulis will have their members procure food on a rotating basis and contribute to the pantry. It is considered a caring gesture for Banu to pick up a treat for their fellow Souli members and add it to the pantry. Essosouli are expected to provide their members with especially nice food from time to time, particularly if it has been sourced from distant locations.  </p><br/><p>Dining out is very popular among Banu. Eating Soulis operate public dining halls where they prepare and serve freshly-made food, generally buffet-style. Members of Soulis that have signed long-term contracts with Eating Soilis are among their most common guests, but most will welcome individual paying customers as well. Just as Banu bring their own plates to their meals at home, they are expected to do this at Eating Soulis. Those who come to an Eating Souli without a plate can often purchase one from a nearby Dishware Souli. Rarely, an Eating Souli will keep emergency plates in stock, but having to use one is seen as uncouth.

That these larger ships that have vast quantities of materials would actually take a significant period of time to unload. And they result in missions for NPCs and/or other players to undertake.<br /><br />We\u2019ve got a pretty comprehensive design right now but we\u2019re still iterating through that because we want to unify some of the functionality for loading and unloading so that it\u2019s the same basic concept on the smaller ships as on the larger ships. And right now what we\u2019ve got in the design stage is something that works, I think, remarkably well on the smaller stage it just doesn\u2019t scale so well when you start talking about several orders of magnitude more materials and how you don\u2019t bottleneck in terms of getting potentially dozens or hundreds of other smaller ships to extract those resources.<br /><br />So we\u2019re still refining exactly how that\u2019s going to work but that\u2019s the general direction. So there is going to be commonality in terms of you\u2019ll have the ability to work at a very localised scale and then you\u2019ll be able to scale that very wide so that there\u2019s content for a large number of players and/or NPCs on these bigger ships.<br /><br />CR: So, yeah, but are you answering whether it\u2019s automatic or not?<br /><br />So like the way I was viewing it is that - and I think that we maybe have this as a later question in the series - when you go ... like on a big space station \u2026 like if I have a big container ship and a pull into the port of LA here a Long Beach there\u2019s a whole set up: there\u2019s longshoremen, big cranes and there\u2019s services. And the crew of the container ship don\u2019t actually unload the containers themselves - there\u2019s equipment that does it and there\u2019s people that are paid to do that. And I would say that in general in the bigger space ports you would have that same kind of setup where you would have the ability to unload the bigger ships, unload the containers. Potentially we\u2019ve talked about having the ability for players to play the part of a longshoreman \u2026<br /><br />TZ: Right.<br /><br />CR \u2026 they\u2019re running around in a little Argo and taking off a container from a Hull E and dropping it to another place and doing that. Or having AI do that. And then there obviously will be cases where - which is probably a later question we have here - there\u2019ll be manual loading and unloading of cargo where you don\u2019t have the big services.

And so I think we\u2019ve been looking at way that you have the automatic option that the services provide for you \u2026<br /><br />TZ: The automatic option when appropriate but the fidelity so that on these smaller ships you can actually \u2026 and this makes for much more interesting gameplay a of times in a lot of different cases because you can imagine scenarios to where you need to deliver a smaller quantity - a half dozen, a dozen - specific crates of some sort of illegal liquor or something to somebody in a planet, and part of the mission is not just finding where to procure this stuff and then get through customs without being detected, but once you are actually on the planet now you\u2019ve got to take these crates physically to that guy before he\u2019s going to give payment. And so all of a sudden you start to get into a much more localised problem where you\u2019re trying to avoid security guards or else you\u2019re going at night because you may be \u2026<br /><br />CR: I think we have that \u2026 I think we have a question that basically asks the same thing a little later on but \u2026<br /><br />TZ: You threw everything off because you reversed everything ...<br /><br />CR: \u2026 well \u2026 yeah \u2026 I kind of \u2026 I went from the big and the services to break it down to the other one.<br /><br />Okay so I think \u2026 so the answer is there\u2019ll be services but we\u2019ll also have some specialised ships and equipment for unloading cargo.

That's one of the things we're really excited about that Chris has talked about before: that if you are the player that kills the Dread Pirate Roberts you'll be going down in history as that person who did that.And so if enough players get together and have a major impact or cut off resources and stuff we're hopefully going to be working to monitor the game to see what's happening and respond, with not only with not only our regular content updates that we're hoping to have, but as well in the Galactopedia and whatever news stories and lore posts we keep on going to be able to look at what's happening in real time in the game and have that influence us so that it will be a conversation almost between the developers and the players as they are playing. And that's really exciting.Adam Wieser: The message boards are going to blow up anyway when the players start doing something or organising, so it's going to be pretty obvious what's going on in a lot of locations for us. I think it's going to be really awesome to tap into that and use the potential for that to maybe open up aspects of the story or the world that we didn't quite think of at first; or to do certain things.

They will have perimeter defenses and detect those that are hostile to them so if an organization wants to come and take over their base they certainly will defend it like you would expect AI or NPCs to do. So that's kinda what would happen there. So we would have a level of NPCs control and command. For instance if you hire NPCs to be part of your crew on your ship or an NPC to fly escort for you than you can give them basic instructions and it's a bit in the wingcommaner style you know if you are talking about wingmen than you can say form on my wing or retreat or attack my target so we will sort of have that kind of stuff that will be available for AI or NPCs that you are communicating with whether they are a bigger ship that you have them escorting you with a cargo hauler full of goods.

From your experience working with them, specifically the fresh meat, would you suggest spending time going and working on a specific theme or style, an aesthetic preference or tailor to more realism regardless?", "answer": "Eric Kieron Davis: This is a great questionDarian Vorlick: This is all you.EKD: So from what I have seen from the artists I have worked alongside is do what inspires you more than just doing something that the industry requires. Like if you love sci fi, you love space ships, focus on that. Focus on 3D environments for that.  There will be companies out there, like ourselves, that are looking for that kind of talent. If you like cartoony, If you like big world, if you like lots of color then do that but what I have always recommended to new artists going into the industry is look for your dream company or dream game and build your portfolio on that. If you get a interview at a company that just does 3d environments that is just forested stuff and all you have is this industrial, broken down rusted environments then they are going to go \"well I don't know how to value you here, I don't know what I can use you for in the gaming we're making.  We don't have any of that here.  So how do you do forests?\" So it more comes down to what you see in the industry that excites you, what you think your strengths are and tailor it to your strengths and building a portfolio around that. I have seen a lot of really great new artists that really just touch everything and that way that can see what they are skilled and talented at so they can tailor their portfolio to the company they are going to work for and this works pretty well so your question of what should you focus on &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; I can't give you an answer as it depends on what you want to work on and what art you want to make or what kind of game or movie or whatever it is you want to go into it's really driven by you and what excites you, from what I have seen with most artists it's what they are passionate about is what they are going to do the best.DV: It also helps to keep an open mind as far as being fairly versatile because there may come a point where you have a skill set or art style that your company likes but at some point they may ask you to do something else totally outside your comfort zone because the needs of the company or the project need you to do something else and if you are not invested in that or that's a skill set you don't have then you or the company may be unhappy with the results. It does pay to have a diverse skill set at least to begin with.EKD: I don't disagree but with some of the portfolios I would be looking at with some of our artists and art directors &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; say you are applying for a senior vehicle artist role and you have just done a bunch of forest stuff. I can't associate what you do with vehicles or with the thing you are applying for. If you are going to apply for something or a company you want to work for... have your diversity but still build your portfolio around what they are looking for at that time. Because we don't have a ton of time to look through everyone's hundreds of pages of images to see you are really good at that one thing. I wish we had the time to do that, this is why on portfolios we say \"front load, give us your best stuff right away\" so you can really give us a sense of who you are. But it does help to do your homework on the company you want to work for, build your portfolio around it, and when you apply really put that stuff up front.", "published_at": "2015-07-13", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 09 (2015.07.13)", "source": "https://youtu.be/ouf5jzk9qg0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Fallun", "published_at_timestamp": 1436825509}, {"objectID": "1141350fa03afd_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "We have not locked the specifications for any of the variants yet, but we are heavily considering different weapon configurations than the base model.

I don't know about smugglers breaking through and spreading it around would be included as such, but we could definitely do it ad-hoc on the game-masters side, as they'll have the tools to create these events around the universe and see things, adjusting play cases based on things they see.

Follow-up question: do all the alien ships follow the same pipeline or are you expecting some to be shortcut in some way (not player pilot capable)?", "answer": "Darian Vorlick: Actually I do have something for that. The main-... I won't say \"the main\"... One of the objectives we want to keep our eye on is that we don't want to make superfluous ships that just serve no purpose. So we're not going to be popping out ships just for the sake of pumping out ships. We want to make sure that any ships we do make and design serve some kind of functionality.Travis Day: Or serve a particular play-style... yeah, exactly.DV: Right. And that way, I wouldn't say that it's going to increase or decrease. Like I said we have a roadmap for what ships we'd like to introduce, and we're going to hopefully continue building more ships. Whether that's going to increase or decrease is going to only depend on what the needs of the game are. We may find that we may need a mid-sized ship, or some kind of corvette, or a battle cruiser, or one that's a large capital class ship that's designed specifically for exploring. We may find the need for that. And then based on what variants we can base or find off of that. So it's a question that I don't think really has a solid answer, because we have a lot ships already in being designed and having been in the hangar. I think it's gonna be based purely on what the needs of the game are.TD: Yeah. And to the follow-up question point-... that was well put, Darian... \"Do all the alien ships follow the same pipeline or are you expecting some shortcut in some way?\" Uh yeah, some of the Vanduul ships for example, and some of the ships that are planned for Squadron 42 exclusively (at least at first) are going to be designed without player-piloting capability.

So the red lights will go on and flash on the bigger ships, which will probably be a pretty good cue to get to the escape pods! And we're also kind of thinking, you know, we're designing this for Squadron 42, and on some of the bigger ships we'll sort of sequence destruction. So, I dunno, your reactor is going to go up, and it starts to go up and then there's explosions all along the length of it. So we're gonna have that, although I don't know if once it gets to that level you'd have to probably be pretty quick to get into the escape pod and escape, but you probably could if you were close enough and do the right thing.

Will they be slugfests of a few hundred meters, or will they be far enough apart to use missiles as standoff weapons while smaller capitals operate as mid-range screening forces?", "answer": "I think it's too early to tell. I think it would also be up to the two commanders of the various capital ships and how they want to fight their battle. Because you certainly would be able to engage at a long range without getting toe-to-toe, and then some ships are probably better at toe-to-toe. I mean if I'm running a carrier, I don't want to bring my carrier in toe-to-toe; I'd be sending out my bombers, and torpedo bombers, and fighter cover and keep everyone at bay, and then try and hunt out the foes. But if I've got a battleship, or a ship that has strong sort of ship-to-ship punch, but not necessarily space air combat cover, then I would probably try to get in close range. And we're going to allow all those options in our capital ship combat setup stuff, which is what the Foundry 42 team is moving towards. So I'm looking forward to that stuff. We've got some stuff that we'll show at Gamescom that involves, not necessarily a capital ship, but at least some more of the cooperative stuff, and then longer-term that'll get even bigger and cooler. So we'll see. That's I think one of the biggest potential promises, or you know, potential great parts of Star Citizen, is sort of this idea that we can have all the way from small ships up to much bigger ships that you can be on with your friends, and you can fight together as a unit or be a lone wolf. So I think the style of combat, much just like the style right now that's happening in Arena Commander - different pilots are fighting different ways. Some are getting up close and personal, some are booming and zooming... all those things will be sort of optional, or up to the players once they fight. And I guess we'll see but the best fighting styles are I would say would probably depend on the kind of ship that you're using though, in terms of how to best utilize it.", "published_at": "2014-08-11", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 33 (2014.08.11)", "source": "https://youtu.be/XBVkhXGX8iI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Robert Lewis", "published_at_timestamp": 1407796258}, {"objectID": "373684950", "question": "Dave Haddock mentioned some stuff about writing in-universe fiction involving player actions, such as interviewing a player who discovers a new jump point and then putting out a Spectrum post about it.Do you know how some large-scale player actions that affect the universe are going to be handled from a lore and gameplay standpoint?Like Operation Pitchfork?", "answer": "Well I'm not so sure... Operation Pitchfork is a pretty big operation, which may be beyond the ability of the game to support in the manner that everyone envisions, but our goal is to really have player actions become part of the universe's lore and fiction.We've actually talked about once the game's live, we'd have part of the live team as almost a news team, but not a news team for today's world, it's a news team for our virtual world.So they're paying attention to what the players are doing and when there's meaningful battles, or exploration, or intrigue, or events happening, they actually create in-fiction reporting content for it. Which could go as far as interviewing some of the players involved, then having it done up as news where, if you go into a bar, there's a program playing on the monitors and it's the 60 minutes of our universe, and it's talking about this event that happened on this side of the galaxy which was a player driven event.If the player driven events are big enough or meaningful enough, our goal would be to run with them and also weave them into what we're doing with the universe. The way to think of it is the same way if you've ever played D&D a long time ago or any sort of tabletop roleplaying game, where the game master has his idea of the story he's taking them on, but he's always constantly taking what the players are doing and folding that in to what he's weaving you as a story.

We're kind of toying around with how we could do this with Squadron 42 in a way that falls into the methodology that we're using, the sort of development methodology. 'Cause I think giving you the whole Squadron 42 as just an alpha may not work as well because it's a story so it needs to be fairly polished as far as that goes, so one of our thoughts is to take Squadron 42 and sort of release it episodically before the game is fully finished where you play the first \"X\" number of missions, that are nice and well done and polished, and then the next \"X\" number of missions a month later and so on until you're done with Squadron 42 which would lead you on to the beta of the Persistent Universe.

We'll probably have a simple level of LOD's in for the Hornet and a couple of the other ships that will launch with the Dogfighting, and you can always reduce your resolution. But obviously as I said a little earlier on in the questions, the optimization stages tends to happen towards the back end of the project. At the very beginning of dogfighting it's probably not going to be very optimized and as time goes on it will get better. You can probably drop the resolution down or the quality level down.
