Do you determine the physical properties of the planets/solar masses, or is that carried out by game designers?", "answer": "Cherie Heiberg: This is a complicated question. There are a lot of steps in the system design process. At the start it definitely originates with the Lore team and we work together to do this. We all sit down together and we discuss what kind of system that we want. We start usually from the star and we work our way out with what kind of planets we want; how many planets are going to be in the system; whether there's a cool science thing that we read about recently that we want to include in it; what's going to make the system fun for the players, like landing zones, different of attractions, how it ties into the lore. We all participate pretty equally in this process, we all have suggestions that get shot down or accepted in pretty equal measure. Dave Haddock is the final arbiter of these decisions and once he gives a \"yes\" or a \"no\" then we have something solid where we can start as far as a system.Once we've had that discussion it's my responsibility to get that all written out. And I send off this information to our astronomers who we work with. And they go over the information that we provided them and they provide us with actual cool math that someone with a huge amount of experience and education can do, someone who is ... has been an astronomer for a while. They do things like ... they take into account orbital residence ... resonance ... and solar masses and spacing the planets out, axial tilts, perihelion and aphelion, whatever else ...Forrest Stephan: I'm just trying to figure out how to do that in the actual game.CH: Well ...FS: And that's the fun part right?CH: Yeah.FS: Once you get everything down and then you implement it into the game.CH: Yeah.FS: And we're building a lot of tech to support all that awesome stuff.CH: Yeah, exactly. And once we get this astronomical data back, I usually ... not usually ... I always go over it and see if they have followed the specs of the system that we want. If they haven't I'll send it back and we get a correction, but this is never anything that is done on purpose. It's usually like a misunder ... miscommunication, sometimes.And the astronomers will also suggest thing to us that we haven't thought of. For example Gonn is the first planet in the Oberon system: that is based on a dead stellar core. It's a dead stellar core right? That's really cool! Because there have been recent discoveries in the past ten years of dead stellar cores orbiting neutron stars and we wouldn't have come across that idea if not for our ... one of our astronomers. Brilliant idea.Once we have the final numbers, this is just like you were talking about, we generally work with Design or the tech artists and we try to find a way to get all this math and all this information into the game and so that it's fun for the players. And Design and Chris Roberts are the final say on what does and does not go in the game.FS: And I would say a lot of us are super excited about the procedural planet stuff that we see coming online and flying around the PU with the Large World, but this bring a whole other excitement value to those techs because that is what actually makes this stuff possible. So for you I expect you have a whole other appreciation ...CH: Oh, I do.FS: ... for that awesome tech that's coming. And to get actually to start testing this stuff in the game environment is going to be super cool. And getting it out of paper. Cool. Awesome.CH: Yeah.FS: Anything else to add.CH: No, no.

This makes me that 1.3 is actually kind of huge in the way of things running smoother. Could you spend a few minutes to describe the sort of impact \"merging the streams\" has on the development process, and how better (or worse) it makes your job?", "answer": "Eric Kieron Davis: I definitely want you to answer the question but there's a part in there I just wanted to chime in on. It's kind of huge in the way things run smoother?  Absolutely having everything condensed into one place means globally as a company we're looking at the same information the same data and we're all working in the same place.We just merged the stream back that we working on the web side and it did make some people not that excited and it broke some things but it got us all looking at the same thing. So we got all those streams back a while ago that was definitely a step in the right direction so now we wait until the last minute right when we're about to release and we break that often we give that to you guys and then we merge all that back so just try and maintain one core sense of development so we can all work together and can all speak in the same languageDarian Vorlick: And we always try and keep the emphasis on stability and I don't know if you guys noticed but the stability of the systems have been much improved as of late since we've been doing. So as far as how we manage the challenge of multiple development streams at the same time well.. that's what we have the different teams for.We may have one person working on  one stream another person is working on a much more public stream so and then some of those come under as QA. For example the QA team may report a bug in the 1.3 stream and we ask them to go back and test see if it's happening in our main development stream as well just to see it may be happening in the 1.3 stream it may not be happening in the main development stream. Because whatever's happening in the main development stream may have fixed it already.So it's kind of being cognitive about what the differences between streams are what's going on in each one. This is where being able to track product milestones and the fixed version in our test bed program Jira come in very useful so we do have a way of reporting in fact we have a daily dashboard that shows how many bugs we have open in this stream and this stream, are they blockers are they critical or are they trivial? We have daily conversation with the production staff globally about what bugs and what tasks need to be tackled before the day is overEKD: You mentioned how better or worse it makes your job it definitely makes it better and how we're maintaining it is even as people work in the 1.3 stream that you guys are seeing we're we have an automation process that we're immediately grabbing that date and trying to bring back into the mainstream at all times now before we didn't even have that operation running so that's been wonderful so that when we are going with 1.3 we're right back working together and we can lop off again for a new stream without going hold on we have to stop everything and merge it back now and becomes this big orchestrated process.We get those emails constantly  \"Hey we're blocked someone needs to help us get this done\". But it's better to do it a little bit at a time it's like you're writing a book or painting a painting everyday you spend a little time on it because by the time you're done on it it looks prettier. And the other part of that question was how do you manage multiple streams at a time and I think you just answered that.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 12", "source": "https://youtu.be/jx2NSZOGNqE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Cavguy & Crazyprsn", "published_at_timestamp": 1445896605}, {"objectID": "11b7f379db4ecd_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The medical profession is one of the more important occupations within Star Citizen, and it's intended to be one of the larger and more flexible roles.  On the FPS combat front Medics will be invaluable.  They'll be able to perform field triage that can heal some injuries entirely and mitigate others enough so that the injured party is at least more functional.  The effects of more serious injuries can often be slowed so that there is a better chance of reaching a hospital where more advanced medical apparatus can improve the chances of survival.  Depending upon the cause of death, a well-trained Medic can occasionally restart a patient's heart, although death may soon reoccur if the root causes are not quickly addressed.", "published_at_timestamp": 1444341600, "question": "With the Hope class ship, do you see Medical as being a complete profession?", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/14994-Q-A-MISC-Endeavor-Part-III", "title": "Q&A: MISC Endeavor - Part III", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "373680880", "question": "Will any of the alien races in Star Citizen have extremely advanced technology, and if so what would their general backstory be? Also will it be possible to find ancient, highly advanced technology and if so will we get to know where it came from and what created it?", "answer": "Will Weissbaum: Our general kind of feeling with the alien races is that we want there to be a good level of challenge for humanity to be able to do kind of engage with them on their own level, So we're trying to make it so each of the alien races has maybe technological focuses that they have, maybe their species has over the centuries focused on this part of technology more so than humanity has. But were all still pretty much equal so that we're gonna have good fights against them.Adam Wieser: Yeah it's going to be fun to engage those other species if you get into such and such situation, And also you know we have some ideas for things when it comes to their technology. There's also a lot about these races that we want you guys to find out for yourself. So that's why we're trying to paint with the broad brush right now, part of the fun and the exploration of the game is being able to kind of get that experience yourself.WW: Yeah, Like you'll learn a lot more once you start engaging with these different characters we hope and you know it'll be a give and take kind of thing, We've talked about Misc going to the Shian for their sweet thruster tec so that's a little bit different or advanced we're borrowing from them, but that's not something where they can move at twice the speed of us or anything, it's just a little bit of an edge and they'll have other tech that's a little worse that they come to humanity for. So we're trying to keep it balanced. As far as ancient tech we have a few bits and pieces here and there, you might have noticed ancient artifacts turn up in your hangers and so they'll be things that were sprinkling around whether they'll be super advanced or not I think we'll stay a little mum right about it right now.AW: Probably better, you know if you go look at Hades there's split planets so who knows, who knows.WW: to explain a little bit more yeah if you could.AW: Oh yeah yeah so you know that there are traces in the hades system that were was an ancient civilization there, so we kinda started to seed in the things about that but again that's something we want you guys to explore as we go live and we expand, so you can kind of unravel that mystery yourself.WW: At least that's what UEE archaeologists believeAW: I guess we'll find out!", "title": "10 for the Writers: Episode 05", "source": "https://youtu.be/u9ZZjMivl84", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Sondrex", "time": "0m44s", "published_at_timestamp": 1444081873}, {"objectID": "373681320", "question": "With the release of Social Module, FPS and finally Ac 2.0, I was wondering what currency we would be using when PU beta is up and running? Will we use UEC or REC and will it be deleted when PU goes Live?", "answer": "Well, as soon as we get the PU up and running properly it will definitely be UEC.  We may actually experiment with using UEC in the Large World multicrew map when we turn on shops and the ability to buy items.  So, whether or not it will get deleted when the PU goes live... I'm not sure.  We have to sort of consider what's happening.  We may very well have a situation where, you know, what you do or what you earn in the multicrew area of the large world map &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; we'll sort of call it... beta or test UEC or it may be the real stuff, I don't know.  To be honest with you, we haven't had a chance to think about that.  But you would definitely be using UEC, not REC.  REC is what you have for Arena Commander which is sort of the gamy credits whereas UEC is the actual in-universe credits.  I'm soft of looking at multicrew as being the baby PU &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; so that's kind of how we'd do it and the question would just be whether it would be &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; you can use the UEC that you have and earn some more UEC but the UEC you actually earn in the multicrew would potentially go away once the game goes live.  Of course, the UEC that you had purchased would not &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; that would carry over to the proper one because obviously that's the UEC that you've purchased or the UEC that came with your pledge.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 64", "source": "https://youtu.be/pxmDw89C3gU", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "xTODMANx", "published_at_timestamp": 1441058458}, {"objectID": "373681690", "question": "Now that CryEngine 3.8.1 is out and finally supports Linux and OpenGL, will we be lucky enough to see a Linux client in the not too distant future?", "answer": "Yes, CryEngine 3.8.2 is out actually, as of the other day. We would very much want to make Linux work. I think there's some issues in the openGL side of things, cause we've done some work and customization on the graphics drivers and the shaders, so that would probably need some support. We already compile the game in Linux, because all our servers run Linux, so we compile CryEngine to Linux, but yeah, I would like to have a Linux client, and it really depends on the timeline of getting openGL implementation they have on CryEngine and making sure it supports the extra additions we've done inside Star Citizen. So, that's really down on our graphics and engine department, and they're pretty busy right now, working on some stuff that I think a lot of people would be excited to see. And, one of them is obviously DX12, so I don't think that I can think I can say this is going to happen in the next month or two, but it's definitely something we would want to do. OpenGL is something we're interested in, as well as DX12 and stuff like that, so I would say, in the not too distant, but not too close, future.

If so, is it something that is along the lines of 'Area 51' where it is an open secret/restricted area or is it something that is completely unknown to the general public? And is there a name for this place that you can share other than REDACTED?", "answer": "Adam Wieser: There is, but I'm going to hold off for a second. So, we do have a lot of systems planned out. We do have a lot of areas designated specifically for the military. Some of them you know about, some of them you will know about, some of them you... might not know about. Some are going to be accessible, you can go visit and do things there, and some you may not get the warmest welcome if you end up trying to land or get close to that system. That said, that's all there, some of that's redacted, there is the moon of Odin II, called Vili, that is a testing ground for experimental weapons. Technically, in the lore of the 'Verse, Behring applied technologies does a lot of testing there, and for those who are unfamiliar with that, go check it out. There's a really good galactic guide post about it. But in essence, it's the 'Verse's worst-kept secret, that this division of Behring basically does super secret, super awesome military weapons and testing and all that. So even though it's technically a private company, it's pretty much well known that they're doing stuff to advance warfare, to advance military components. Again, that's on Vili, the moon of Odin II. You can land there at a place called Rawley station, you're not going to get too far because of the secrecy that's surrounding it. So you could say it's, in essence, an area like Area 51, there's the knowledge that it's out there, I'm sure there're plenty of rumours as to what exactly is being done there. You could maybe drive up to the gate, but you definitely won't be invited in, and there definitely won't be a lot of civilian activity there. So if you do have an interest in that aspect of the gameplay, I would suggest maybe you go hang out there, or look into that a little bit.Cherie Heiberg: Excellent idea. Definitely go knock on the door of the secret military base.AW: Yeah, just say hi. Here for a tour.CH: You're cool, just tell them you're cool, and they'll let you in.

Maybe you can do a lock down, where the boarders might need special tools to get through bulkheads, you can pressurise and depressurise areas. I mentioned in the last 10FTC that we have a cool prototype working that has these elements in it. We have a new ship system management thing we call GOST (Game Object STate), which lives with the vehicles themselves which allows the designers to assign certain logic to different ships.

So we are going to have ships, weapons and gear that we will not sell pre-release, so collectors of ships/items etc are safe and will still have lots to do in the PU. I view a lot of these items as rare/unique items like in a traditional fantasy MMO. I'm very keen on creating a need for players to explore, for instance you won't be able to get all the weapons in all the shops in all the locations, so there might be a gun shop on a planet that has a particular guy that can make ballistic weapons that are 20% better than the rest of them, say, so players will have to go here to get those weapons specifically etc. I want to encourage players to travel around to look and find things, like going onto a derelict wreck in an asteroid field, where there might be some alien tech, or some salvageable weapons, all that kind of stuff.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 47 (2014.12.01)", "source": "https://youtu.be/E8Euwh_fPeg", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "MrFixIt", "published_at_timestamp": 1417474885}, {"objectID": "373678540", "question": "Within Star Citizen there are a variety of water planets in various systems.

I'd like to know how it's going to work too!But no, all seriousness, we do plan for you to be able to loan your ships. We haven't worked out the specific details of the edge cases. What happens when he doesn't want to give it back to you? What happens if he's flown your ship to the other side of the galaxy, and you're on this side and you want your ship back? ... And he's not gonna bring it back for you, or he's just left the game. Do you have to go over there to get it? How do you get it back? Does he bring it back to you? Does it automatically just come back to your hangar, after a period of time? So, we haven't fleshed out that part of the design yet, and that is definitely something that we will need to do for the Persistent Universe. It's just not... there's some other more important things to get out of the way before we get into the loaning-of-ship stuff.We'll definitely have that figured out - how you can loan ships for other people - and we've just got to figure out the issues of the edge cases I brought up.

Maybe you can shield yourself behind an asteroid, or maybe you can shut down a bunch of systems so your signature is really small, or maybe you could coat your ship in a kind of armor that would give you a much lower reflective signature.So we'll definitely have radar shadow be part of that and we're hoping, thinking, it's actually going to add a lot of fun to the gameplay and nuance because there's just a lot of different options for people to take things in space and that's kind of part of the things we're really excited about for what we're doing with Star Citizen.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 01 (2013.12.06)", "source": "https://youtu.be/QACEabB_8lA", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Buran", "published_at_timestamp": 1391813631}]
