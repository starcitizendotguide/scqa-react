The group initially formed as they participated in community aid programs and staged peaceful protests of the new laws. However, as more and more of their members were arrested, imprisoned, and executed, their goals shifted from one of changing Human society to creating a society of their own. They founded a settlement in 2655, utilizing an abandoned mining outpost on the asteroid Delamar in the Nyx system. Named Levski after a historical revolutionary figure, the People\u2019s Alliance welcomed anyone fleeing the rule of the Messers, and the community grew.

And as I kind of touched on the previous answer, yes, persistent entity streaming is per server. But as you can take items out of the server database into your global database, and we made sure it's the same exact database, the same data structures, there will be more persistence. So you can take persistence from one server to another server by putting items into your inventory and then taking them out of the inventory into a new server. Your second question is, how do we get back onto the same server? For 3.18, we won't address any matchmaking changes. And it again comes back to we want to get at par with what we have so far before we start to adding the new features. Also, matchmaking changes will become a part of our server meshing work, which we will start, obviously, right after persistent entity streaming hits. So for the very first version of persistent entity streaming, you will just use the same matchmaking logic you have right now. That means if you start up your client, you get randomly matched to a server or a shard. I can use those terms interchangeable at the moment because they are pretty much the same thing. Obviously, it's the same as right now. You can play with your friends, so you would join the same instance. If you crash out of a game, we reserve the slot of your current shard. So that means if you crash out, you will be able to have, I think it's 10 minutes, to lock back in and get connected to that shard so you can recover anything. And as I said earlier, all items which you take into your inventory, that's what you will keep with you, which you can bring to any shard. So that is your way to basically make sure the stuff you want to really keep, you can keep by just putting it into your inventories.", "source": "https://youtu.be/jXvIO8vJkgI", "published_at": "2022-09-16", "title": "Star Citizen Live: Persistent Entity Streaming", "type": "youtube", "published_at_timestamp": 1663350921}, {"objectID": "1b7cd8e702abaa_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The Mule will fall in line with other vehicles and ships, so will either offer restricted access or impaired use based on the type of armor worn when this feature comes online in a future patch.", "published_at": "2022-05-28", "published_at_timestamp": 1653688800, "question": "Can you wear a heavy environment suit, like the Pembroke armor, while seated in the driver's compartment?", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/18685-Q-A-Drake-Mule", "title": "Q&A: Drake Mule", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "1a3cbe7c974c57_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "It is separated by a door to prevent exactly this scenario.

What has caused them to be held up for so long after the male model was released? What are the current issues that stop the model(s) from being available in the 'Verse?", "answer": "Sean Tracy: So, I can blame all kinds of departments... I mean Steve will be super happy... so Steve Bender right now is in Frankfurt, you know my partner in crime there. We all have an office that is also shared so I'm going to blame Steve on this one. Would I say animations is behind, no and that's not really the problem actually, we've had...Forrest Stephan: There's a lot of hurdles.ST: A couple different things on the mesh that I'll let Forrest answer on the animation technology side. What we really want is a completely finished male. That doesn't mean mesh, that doesn't mean necessarily like outfits and things like that, what it means is everything to do with animation. So, we've got most of it, right. We've got a lot of first person stuff, holding weapons, we've got cover, we finally now got mantling and vaulting. So basically once mantling,vaulting, cover, locomotion, ships, what else am I missing, I'm missing something and AI sort of interactions anyways.Once those are all done for now, then we can basically just plunk a female into it. There's a technical implementation side of this where we actually have to plug a whole bunch of stuff within ManneQuin, if any of the asset names are different between the male and the female, and sometimes we've done this, that's going to cause some problems within ManneQuin. We actually want to use the exact same logic that a male does to the female cause we don't want to be fixing two different bugs first of all...FS: Here's the thing right, exactly we don't want to make the same mistake twice and we don't want to make the same mistake in parallel with each other...ST: That's it.FS: The one thing we are doing is we're figuring out every single thing that goes right and goes wrong and figuring out our complete process and then taking the female character and having a much smoother transition and making sure that everything works properly with everything we've learned from the male character.ST: Exactly. Then that way a female implementation is easy, it doesn't take us nearly as much time because a lot of it is, 'oh, how did we do the male. Ok, let's do it the same'. So, that's what's going to solve all our problems for that. The other thing that this gives us a huge benefit for is the Vanduul, it's going to be the exact same process. So, once that male is completely locked down for the Squadron 42 aspect of it, vaulting, mantling and all the animation... then females, you know, it's not done but we got all the assets, it's just a matter of plugging it in.FS: Yeah, we're still doing some polish to the actual female herself, the body, you know we want to make sure that that's correct...ST: Should we talk about her 4K nether region texture...FS: Never outsource...ST: So, that was interesting...FS: Never outsource characters.ST: Yeah, if you outsource characters, just be prepared to get stuff back you might not be expecting.FS: You never know what you're going to get.ST: They don't want me to talk about it but a 4K nether region I think you can figure out what that means. 4K texture for that... just don't get it.FS: Then there's obviously the rigs and everything you've got to solve but the female model is coming along and I'm personally very excited to have it. We've already had some clothing made for it, we want to get that and I think that's going to fall under the customization too. We had to figure out how the players are going to be able to customize themselves with all their items and stuff, and the male had a series of clothes already so we were able to tackle that challenge and figure it out and now we can move onto the female. So, super excited that is coming very soon.ST: Right, and just to give you a full, sort of, look on this...the females we've already got them locomoting around, we've got a bunch within Squadron 42 that are specific to Squadron 42 so they all work. It's just a matter of you not having seen them within the persistent universe yet because when we give them to you, we want to have customization as you said, we want to have all the same outfits as the male. We basically don't want to take anything away from the female, right.FS: Then there's the whole, we have all our heads, right. So we've been solving, you have your body then you have these head scans, how do the head scans fit on the body, match it with the topology, the skin tone...ST: You've got to match up the skin tone.FS: Which is a whole...which is a challenge. So, there's just a lot of things we got to do one step at a time to make sure we don't make the same mistake twice. It's as efficient as possible.ST: Yeah, when they come online they'll be fully featured so we won't just kind of build them out slowly, they'll just be...FS: Yeah, exactly.", "published_at": "2016-05-03", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 08", "source": "https://youtu.be/j02lrXo3fXA", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Solaias", "published_at_timestamp": 1462234019}, {"objectID": "373680640", "question": "Can you explain in short what DataForge is and how it is used in the different areas?", "answer": "Eric Kieron Davis: I'm going to look at Calix for thisCalix Reneau: Shortest version of DataForge is it's how we integrate our XML into the game.

Will we see the use of controlled explosions from grenades or even fire extinguishers to help propel players & NPCs in various directions or perhaps even launch objects at an oncoming enemy?", "answer": "Travis Day: Yes. We actually have a lot of interaction with the environment. It's one of the things that is very cool about the FPS because like so much of what we do, what we're doing in this one module applies to the universe at large. It's like an R&D test bed for what we're going to be doing in the rest of the persistent universe. For example, on Gold Horizon - a James Cameron Alien-esque feeling space station - you walk into the cafeteria for example and you throw an EMP grenade in there. It detonates and you can see as the pulse wave goes out, all the lights along will shatter. All the screens will be disrupted, and it will end up darkening the entire room so you can sneak in there if you want to. So, there's a lot of interesting ways that you can interact with the environment - you can turn on and off gravity on the gravity generators, you can open and close doors/ammo boxes, there is vaulting, mantling, you can slide into cover. So, there's a lot of different ways you, as a player - both from a game-changing perspective but also just animation and immersion in the world movement - really interact with the environment and that's only going to get more so. I mean, you talk about fire extinguishers to help propel the player and interestingly one of our weapons, it's a bit unique, is a force propulsion grenade which is essentially just a concussive blast wave that's meant to propel players and it imparts a physics push on all of the players. And with our new articulated entity ragdoll system, depending on where it hits and how much force it has at that distance from the grenade, it will impart a different level of push back and so while it may seem like kind of a lame grenade when you could just throw a frag grenade vs a force propulsion grenade, when you're in zero-G it becomes super effective, which is really fun to see.

I mean so really the way the ships work is that you sort of buy a hull and then you can customize and add different items and equipment to it, but we're not really set up to buy a rear wing and then a fender from a different ship and put them all together so they make some hybrid ship. So I'm not sure if we'll be able to build ships from parts, not at the beginning we definitely won't be able to build ships from parts, who knows down the road. But you certainly will be able to buy different equipment and items and add them to your ship and some potentially could be an alien item that you could have to have adapted to work on your ship. So maybe sort of a small combination of this, but not to the extent that you can build a ship wholly out of just junk parts.", "published_at": "2014-01-17", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 05 (2014.01.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/RtyZzO5OrE0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Jasticus", "published_at_timestamp": 1389982600}]
