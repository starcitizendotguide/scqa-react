Thank you!</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p>Hi everyone, </p><br/><p>When we realized that our old Roadmap didn\u2019t represent our development progress very well, we started exploring options for how to build something more informational that fit how we develop games. Our original message about this was in one of March\u2019s <a href=\"https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/spectrum-dispatch/17518-Roadmap-Roundup-March-13th-2020\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/spectrum-dispatch/17518-Roadmap-Roundup-March-13th-2020\" target=\"_blank\">Roadmap Roundups</a></a>, and we followed up with hints about this in our Squadron 42-focused Calling All Devs on March 13.  </p><br/><p>We mentioned then that we are happy with Squadron 42 development and committed to a few things I\u2019d like to bring up again. We talked about injecting more Squadron 42 content into our regularly scheduled releases, which is why you may have noticed things like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPWc4hlyUu0\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPWc4hlyUu0\" target=\"_blank\">Squadron 42 themed episode</a></a> of Calling All Devs, or the Inside Star Citizen updates on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8hoEbs4krE\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8hoEbs4krE\" target=\"_blank\">Vanduul ships</a></a>, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/LvQ-Qoxosqc\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/LvQ-Qoxosqc\" target=\"_blank\">gas tech</a></a>, a deeper look at the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qSZiOxyVGmI\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/qSZiOxyVGmI\" target=\"_blank\">Aciedo Comm Array</a></a>, and other related content. This was all alongside our monthly Squadron 42 Reports (<a href=\"https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/17545-Squadron-42-Monthly-Report-March-2020\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/17545-Squadron-42-Monthly-Report-March-2020\" target=\"_blank\">March</a></a>, <a href=\"https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/17590-Squadron-42-Monthly-Report-April-2020\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/17590-Squadron-42-Monthly-Report-April-2020\" target=\"_blank\">April</a></a>, <a href=\"https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/17641-Squadron-42-Monthly-Report-May-2020\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/17641-Squadron-42-Monthly-Report-May-2020\" target=\"_blank\">May</a></a>, <a href=\"https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/17673-Squadron-42-Monthly-Report-June-2020\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/17673-Squadron-42-Monthly-Report-June-2020\" target=\"_blank\">June</a></a>). One of the important elements to messaging Squadron 42 updates has also been to raise awareness that work completed for Star Citizen is also work done for Squadron 42. The only content that\u2019s exclusively SQ42 are people, places and plot \u2013 and we don\u2019t want to spoil those. </p><br/><p>With all SQ42 updates, our goal has been to find balance in sharing SQ42 content while minimally impacting the development team so they can focus on what matters most: finishing the game.  </p><br/><p>The recent SQ42 video update, which is a brand-new show we were debuting called  \u201cThe Briefing Room,\u201d was a lower-effort video that we embarked on with the goal of sharing more information with you but in a scrappy and fast manner, so as to minimize the disruption to the dev team and yet still give you new information. We planned for this to be a semi-regular show, with its cadence depending on how well the content was received and how disruptive (or not) this first episode would be to our dev team. This first episode was meant to focus specifically on (spoiler alert) updates on our conversation interrupt tech and level design in SQ42. What we discovered after the whole piece was finished and getting ready for publish was that our approach resulted in an underwhelming show. Not only did the episode have major audio issues due to WFH recording, but it lacked visuals to support the talking, and we truly prefer to show rather than tell. Ultimately, we decided that it wasn\u2019t good enough to show, even for a \u201cscrappy\u201d video that was not meant to be a marketing sizzle trailer. However, before that \u201cstop ship\u201d message could permeate our entire marketing org, we had moved forward with a public publish date.  </p><br/><p>Originally, we thought we could simply splice in fresh b-roll, but as we spent the next few days reviewing the show, we saw the need to update our visuals to better reflect what we were discussing, and that led us to the realization that we still didn\u2019t have the right footage, at our quality bar, to tell the story we wanted to tell. So, we ended up deciding to re-shoot the entire episode with our usual quality standards. As mentioned, The Briefing Room was never meant to be such a disruption to the team that we would prioritize footage for the show above our internal milestones for development. Therefore, our SQ42 art team could only work on capturing new footage after normal work hours. Add to the mix that key personnel were actually out sick for over a week, and you can see how our schedule kept getting pushed back further and further.  </p><br/><p>We\u2019ve certainly communicated the delays and the reasons for it, and have even had Brian Chambers relay the news initially, with our CMs repeating that message when the topic cropped up multiple times. We\u2019ve had to do that a couple of times over the past weeks. And unfortunately, the plain truth was always the same: The initial video didn\u2019t meet our standards and we are redoing it.  We didn\u2019t get into such details as sick personnel nor did we explicitly spell out that the video footage couldn\u2019t leapfrog actual dev work in our priority list. After all, we don\u2019t like to make excuses. But it\u2019s clear that the confluence of the prolonged delay to the Briefing Room and the lack of any new information (because there was none) created angst within the community. </p><br/><p>Something that\u2019s often not seen externally is the actual amount of time and effort it takes to put together the video content we regularly release. Delivering the updates to the standards we want takes time, and despite those saying they would be fine with a rough cut of talking heads, we get endless complaints when that\u2019s what we deliver, example being that the Monthly Reports or linked examples above are quickly dismissed or forgotten. The SQ42 video is still coming (probably in the next few weeks), along with an assortment of other updates, including an overhaul to our Public Roadmap. </p><br/><p>The new Roadmap is something we hinted at in March but because that is still very much in development, we can\u2019t share as much about it as I would like. Believe me when I say I\u2019m personally very eager to release it to you. We took the time to explore options for how we could better represent our progress, and I believe we are getting close to landing in a pretty great spot. Our goal with this new Roadmap is to give you better visibility into what teams are working on, share the progress of more teams, and go so far as to indicate the size of the projects for our tech, features, and content teams. This new Roadmap will drastically change how you follow the development progress for both Squadron 42 <b><u><b><u>and</u></u> </b></b>Star Citizen. The new Roadmap will focus more on breaking out teams and features so you can interactively see what is being worked on across all teams, as opposed to what features will make X release. While it\u2019s not quite ready, it\u2019s currently top priority on the web team\u2019s current projects. In the immediate future, we plan to deliver the following communications: </p><p>Give an explanation of the goals of our new Roadmap and what to expect from it </p><p>Show a rough mockup of the proposed new Roadmap </p><p>Share a work in progress version of the Roadmap for at least one of our core teams </p><p>And then finally transition to this new Roadmap </p><p>We\u2019ll approach them in the order above, and we\u2019ll likely need a few weeks between steps, so I don\u2019t want to create the impression that this is happening overnight. But we should be announcing step 1 pretty soon if my meeting on Thursday about this is as good as I think it will be. :blush:  </p>", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/3/thread/squadron-42-roadmap-update", "published_at_timestamp": 1688545789, "title": "Squadron 42 & Roadmap Update", "type": "post"}, {"objectID": "de671c5277ea3_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Emperor (Tao\u2019nuasao / Tao\u2019yusao)", "answer": "The Emperor (Tao\u2019nuasao) is the sovereign monarch of the Xi\u2019an Empire (SaoXy\u2019an).

And as I kind of touched on the previous answer, yes, persistent entity streaming is per server. But as you can take items out of the server database into your global database, and we made sure it's the same exact database, the same data structures, there will be more persistence. So you can take persistence from one server to another server by putting items into your inventory and then taking them out of the inventory into a new server. Your second question is, how do we get back onto the same server? For 3.18, we won't address any matchmaking changes. And it again comes back to we want to get at par with what we have so far before we start to adding the new features. Also, matchmaking changes will become a part of our server meshing work, which we will start, obviously, right after persistent entity streaming hits. So for the very first version of persistent entity streaming, you will just use the same matchmaking logic you have right now. That means if you start up your client, you get randomly matched to a server or a shard. I can use those terms interchangeable at the moment because they are pretty much the same thing. Obviously, it's the same as right now. You can play with your friends, so you would join the same instance. If you crash out of a game, we reserve the slot of your current shard. So that means if you crash out, you will be able to have, I think it's 10 minutes, to lock back in and get connected to that shard so you can recover anything. And as I said earlier, all items which you take into your inventory, that's what you will keep with you, which you can bring to any shard. So that is your way to basically make sure the stuff you want to really keep, you can keep by just putting it into your inventories.", "source": "https://youtu.be/jXvIO8vJkgI", "title": "Star Citizen Live: Persistent Entity Streaming", "type": "youtube", "published_at_timestamp": 1663350921}, {"objectID": "1b7cd8e702abaa_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The Mule will fall in line with other vehicles and ships, so will either offer restricted access or impaired use based on the type of armor worn when this feature comes online in a future patch.", "published_at_timestamp": 1653688800, "question": "Can you wear a heavy environment suit, like the Pembroke armor, while seated in the driver's compartment?", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/18685-Q-A-Drake-Mule", "title": "Q&A: Drake Mule", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "1a3cbe7c974c57_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "It is separated by a door to prevent exactly this scenario.

Brian continues to say that it's \"not an all-or-nothing\", and that they could have some stuff come in before the entire Vulkan backend is there. He's been told that DX11 will already benefit from the first two stages, and as such there should be some performance improvements because of that.

I mean Steve will be super happy... so Steve Bender right now is in Frankfurt, you know my partner in crime there. We all have an office that is also shared so I'm going to blame Steve on this one. Would I say animations is behind, no and that's not really the problem actually, we've had...Forrest Stephan: There's a lot of hurdles.ST: A couple different things on the mesh that I'll let Forrest answer on the animation technology side. What we really want is a completely finished male. That doesn't mean mesh, that doesn't mean necessarily like outfits and things like that, what it means is everything to do with animation. So, we've got most of it, right. We've got a lot of first person stuff, holding weapons, we've got cover, we finally now got mantling and vaulting. So basically once mantling,vaulting, cover, locomotion, ships, what else am I missing, I'm missing something and AI sort of interactions anyways.Once those are all done for now, then we can basically just plunk a female into it. There's a technical implementation side of this where we actually have to plug a whole bunch of stuff within ManneQuin, if any of the asset names are different between the male and the female, and sometimes we've done this, that's going to cause some problems within ManneQuin. We actually want to use the exact same logic that a male does to the female cause we don't want to be fixing two different bugs first of all...FS: Here's the thing right, exactly we don't want to make the same mistake twice and we don't want to make the same mistake in parallel with each other...ST: That's it.FS: The one thing we are doing is we're figuring out every single thing that goes right and goes wrong and figuring out our complete process and then taking the female character and having a much smoother transition and making sure that everything works properly with everything we've learned from the male character.ST: Exactly. Then that way a female implementation is easy, it doesn't take us nearly as much time because a lot of it is, 'oh, how did we do the male. Ok, let's do it the same'. So, that's what's going to solve all our problems for that. The other thing that this gives us a huge benefit for is the Vanduul, it's going to be the exact same process. So, once that male is completely locked down for the Squadron 42 aspect of it, vaulting, mantling and all the animation... then females, you know, it's not done but we got all the assets, it's just a matter of plugging it in.FS: Yeah, we're still doing some polish to the actual female herself, the body, you know we want to make sure that that's correct...ST: Should we talk about her 4K nether region texture...FS: Never outsource...ST: So, that was interesting...FS: Never outsource characters.ST: Yeah, if you outsource characters, just be prepared to get stuff back you might not be expecting.FS: You never know what you're going to get.ST: They don't want me to talk about it but a 4K nether region I think you can figure out what that means. 4K texture for that... just don't get it.FS: Then there's obviously the rigs and everything you've got to solve but the female model is coming along and I'm personally very excited to have it. We've already had some clothing made for it, we want to get that and I think that's going to fall under the customization too. We had to figure out how the players are going to be able to customize themselves with all their items and stuff, and the male had a series of clothes already so we were able to tackle that challenge and figure it out and now we can move onto the female. So, super excited that is coming very soon.ST: Right, and just to give you a full, sort of, look on this...the females we've already got them locomoting around, we've got a bunch within Squadron 42 that are specific to Squadron 42 so they all work. It's just a matter of you not having seen them within the persistent universe yet because when we give them to you, we want to have customization as you said, we want to have all the same outfits as the male. We basically don't want to take anything away from the female, right.FS: Then there's the whole, we have all our heads, right. So we've been solving, you have your body then you have these head scans, how do the head scans fit on the body, match it with the topology, the skin tone...ST: You've got to match up the skin tone.FS: Which is a whole...which is a challenge. So, there's just a lot of things we got to do one step at a time to make sure we don't make the same mistake twice.

Although, we do have a stamina model so if you did look at some of the demos that were video recorded, you would see that my guy in his heavy armour after a little bit ran out of breath and wasn't really as quick.  But, I think we would probably let you sprint around just to move around quickly if you wanted to.  It's like the same issues we've got... we've got a lot of in-game/in-fiction stuff like in terms of being able to transfer credits and all the rest of the stuff that happen at sort of the speed of the game but there's some things like team communication that &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; as much as I would like it to be realistic and you really can't talk in real time to someone in another star system &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; we kind of acknowledge that we can't really stop that because people can have Teamspeak or Skype open while they're playing the game and talking to all of their organization mates.

Now a lot of those issues are already written up in our database cause we ran into them during our normal sanity checks and smoke tests and sweeps and stuff like that, but the ones that do get rise to the top, those are the ones we investigate, we make sure we get in the database, we make sure we get fixes out there because we know the backers want that stuff fixed as soon as possible.Randy Vasquez: So some people might not even know what the Issue Council is. What, like...VS: Issue Council is where the backers and all our Subscribers should be going to report any sort of issues, and then if you run into it you vote it up and the higher it goes in the chain the sooner we take a look at it and get it taken care of.RV: Nice. That's kind of cool. I've never used it since I just kind of go over to your desk and I'm like...VS: Yeah, you say is this happening and then you hit me and yeah, that's exactly what happens pretty much for everybody.RV: Basically.

And while we can't say for sure that it will be its own modular room, you'll definitely be able to outfit really any ship and not just a Redeemer by tuning what equipment you use for these kinds of communications, electronic warfare, info running-type gameplay where you can trade out some weapons for some additional comm gear. You can tune your avionics in your ship to either defend against or make you a better info runner or jammer. It won't really be locked to one ship.

Will we see the use of controlled explosions from grenades or even fire extinguishers to help propel players & NPCs in various directions or perhaps even launch objects at an oncoming enemy?", "answer": "Travis Day: Yes. We actually have a lot of interaction with the environment. It's one of the things that is very cool about the FPS because like so much of what we do, what we're doing in this one module applies to the universe at large. It's like an R&D test bed for what we're going to be doing in the rest of the persistent universe. For example, on Gold Horizon - a James Cameron Alien-esque feeling space station - you walk into the cafeteria for example and you throw an EMP grenade in there. It detonates and you can see as the pulse wave goes out, all the lights along will shatter. All the screens will be disrupted, and it will end up darkening the entire room so you can sneak in there if you want to. So, there's a lot of interesting ways that you can interact with the environment - you can turn on and off gravity on the gravity generators, you can open and close doors/ammo boxes, there is vaulting, mantling, you can slide into cover. So, there's a lot of different ways you, as a player - both from a game-changing perspective but also just animation and immersion in the world movement - really interact with the environment and that's only going to get more so. I mean, you talk about fire extinguishers to help propel the player and interestingly one of our weapons, it's a bit unique, is a force propulsion grenade which is essentially just a concussive blast wave that's meant to propel players and it imparts a physics push on all of the players. And with our new articulated entity ragdoll system, depending on where it hits and how much force it has at that distance from the grenade, it will impart a different level of push back and so while it may seem like kind of a lame grenade when you could just throw a frag grenade vs a force propulsion grenade, when you're in zero-G it becomes super effective, which is really fun to see. It's that kind of dynamic behaviour that makes the module so interesting and so much fun and seeing how that would play out in the persistent universe is really fun too.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 06 (2015.05.04)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Jmsn9aURZ4Q", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Kommadore", "published_at_timestamp": 1430776682}, {"objectID": "373677860", "question": "With the introduction of the 315p, one of the things I've been looking at has been the tractor beam. Will we be able to manipulate our environments to better suit us in combat? For example, can we tow asteroids into different positions, or launch/slingshot debris at our enemies?", "answer": "Well the tractor beam isn't implemented yet, but it's going to have a control/grav mechanic, it'll make whatever you're hauling with it be \"connected\" to your ship, so you should be able to treat it like dragging around a piece of mass. I don't know what the strength of the beam will be yet, but assuming that there's one that you can grab hold of, you could fly your ship around and release the asteroid with momentum enough to continue in that direction. So potentially I could see people using the tractor beam in interesting ways for combat. It'll all be physically simulated correctly, think of the tractor beam as a virtual rope, and just like that there'll be limits on how big an object and how much mass you can tow etc.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 46 (2014.11.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/FXnNwUmnl3o", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Sajuuk", "published_at_timestamp": 1416870046}, {"objectID": "373678300", "question": "In the hornet commercial we see the Aurora's lasers (or bullets) zipping past its target and hitting the nearby asteroids causing debris (rock) to break off and drift into space. This effect is absent in AC but can we expect it in the final game?", "answer": "Yes! Ok I won't just give a one word answer here either :-P. There are a few asteroids that you can shoot and blow into pieces that we already have in AC, but that's something we're working on, we need to have the asteroids break apart and be synchronised across the network properly without increasing network traffic too much, and that's part of a whole new network prediction scheme that we're putting in for V1.0 which will hopefully allow us to scale a lot more ships in space, which is quite a clever little spline based prediction dead reckoning system, so for anyone that's doing network stuff that may mean something to you. But it'll also help us do stuff with asteroids and other rigid bodies moving around in space, which will have a big effect on the PU and AC.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 43 (2014.10.27)", "source": "https://youtu.be/phk-0zch1NI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Moggel", "published_at_timestamp": 1414447201}, {"objectID": "373678670", "question": "Some throttle controllers have multiple throttle inputs. Would it be possible to set each of those controls to throttle an individual engine? That way if I need to make a fast turn in my Starfarer I could throttle down the left engine and keep the right one at full blast.", "answer": "Yes, that's actually something that, looking at the HOTAS control setups that are around, some have that ability. We've considered it, we're not 100% sure about doing it, though the system supports it as each thruster is physically modelled correctly and supplies thrust individually. So, I would say that would be something that we'd consider, as it's not too hard, but no promises.

But hopefully by the end of the year we should have a drop with some multi-crew ships in, but we still have some technical stuff... So, we showed kind of the prototype at Gamescom but we have to get the double precision working, 'cause we really need bigger spaces and bigger areas when we get bigger ships. So that's kind of what we want to have working before we roll out the multi-crew ships to everyone, which hopefully will be by the end of this year, but we'll see.So, gift passes to invite non-backers to join us for a week or so... So that's kind of a cool idea. I mean at the moment we weren't necessarily planning on that because that's sort of extra functionality, like a guest pass or something like that. But I would assume that perhaps you could do something where someone would have to have a registered account, and as long as they installed and downloaded it, and then we could basically assign a badge, or you as a backer could assign a badge - like a \"crew badge\" - that would enable them to maybe join as a crew member. But we'd have to have the lobby system for the multi-crew ships going on. So I'll take that under consideration. It could actually be pretty cool. It'd certainly be fun to have a multi-crew ship and get some of your friends to join you and have some fun on it, and go from there.

I mean so really the way the ships work is that you sort of buy a hull and then you can customize and add different items and equipment to it, but we're not really set up to buy a rear wing and then a fender from a different ship and put them all together so they make some hybrid ship. So I'm not sure if we'll be able to build ships from parts, not at the beginning we definitely won't be able to build ships from parts, who knows down the road. But you certainly will be able to buy different equipment and items and add them to your ship and some potentially could be an alien item that you could have to have adapted to work on your ship. So maybe sort of a small combination of this, but not to the extent that you can build a ship wholly out of just junk parts.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 05 (2014.01.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/RtyZzO5OrE0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Jasticus", "published_at_timestamp": 1389982600}]
