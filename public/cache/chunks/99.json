Would that be it's own dedicated resource with ships around it?", "answer": "With Dynamic Server Meshing, it's possible that large ships such as a Javelin could have their own dedicated server assigned to run the authoritative simulation for that ship and everything on it. However, we're trying to avoid having inflexible rules about how entities get assigned to processing resources, so that might not always be the case. It comes down to efficiency in terms of both processing speed and server costs. If we had a hard rule that each Javelin and everything in it gets its own server, then it wouldn't be very cost-efficient when a Javelin only has a handful of players on it. The same rule also wouldn't be efficient in terms of server processing speed if there were hundreds of players all crowded into the same Javelin, as the rule would prevent us from distributing the processing load across multiple servers.<br/><br/>Dynamic Server Meshing will be a bit different in that it will constantly re-evaluate how best to distribute the simulation, aiming to find the sweet spot so that no single server is overloaded or underutilized. As players move around the 'verse, the ideal distribution of processing resources will change. To react to those changes, we'll need the ability to transfer authority over entities from one server to another, as well as bring new servers online and shut down old ones. This will allow us to move the processing load from a server that is at risk of becoming overloaded to one that is currently underutilized. If none of the existing servers have enough spare capacity to handle an increase in load, we can simply rent more servers from our cloud platform provider. And when some servers don't have enough load to make them cost-efficient, some of them can transfer their parts of the simulation over to the others and we can shut down the ones we no longer need.", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/18397-Server-Meshing-And-Persistent-Streaming-Q-A", "published_at": "2021-11-10", "published_at_timestamp": 1636502400, "title": "Server Meshing and Persistent Streaming Q&A", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "3afc5ea656b3_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The big differentiator is the M2 is not designed specifically to carry spaceships, let alone multiple spaceships, which is the Liberator's key role.", "published_at": "2021-10-20", "published_at_timestamp": 1634680800, "question": "What is the primary usage difference between this and the M2?", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/18365-Q-A-Anvil-Liberator", "title": "Q&A: Anvil Liberator", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "cffb0fbb938b3_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "What things have you learned and are going to change with regards to crime stats for LAWFUL players during these events?

They were all quite high level at the time because obviously no systems had been built out and they were more conceptual Obviously as we approach more actual professions being available to backers over the course of the year, presumably there needs to be quite a bit more detail given to the community in terms of how are we going to be doing these things and what are the mechanics involved, is that something that\u2019s coming soon?", "answer": "ER: Definitely, there are a lot of systems being put into place which will basically support everything the player will do. I can\u2019t remember the name we have for it internally right now but there is a whole system for players etc communicating while in space with regards to jobs. So let\u2019s say you want to send out a distress call. You can send that to just your friends or anybody, some people may come and help you, some may try and kill you, who knows. That entire system is basically the same system in which if you\u2019re out in your ship and you run out of fuel, you\u2019d put out a tender to say \u201cHey, I\u2019m at this location, please bring me fuel and I\u2019ll pay you X\u201d. This is all the system we\u2019re building out now and it\u2019s part of the whole new mission framework system. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re quantum travelling and you get interdicted by pirates and you communicate for help, it could be players or NPC\u2019s and it\u2019s basically a jobbing system.<br /><br />The overall system is the same basic one whether it\u2019s for distress, asking people to do something, asking someone to join you and so forth. That system effectively gives a huge capacity for players to get together and do stuff in game. We need that system along with interdiction of course if you want to do cargo runs. There is going to be the \u201cbuy 500 tons of this\u201d and we\u2019ll have to balance that and pricing and I\u2019m sure it will be difficult to balance, but if you can just buy stuff, fly somewhere and then get your money, well there\u2019s no risk to that and that\u2019s no fun, there should be a well-balanced risk/reward.<br /><br/>When we put in mining, same thing, you\u2019re mining away and then get attacked, distress or need someone to come and haul stuff you\u2019ve left nearby away etc and you\u2019ll pay them X. These are all jobbing type systems and of course there will be mechanics for mining and everything else, but these systems are much simpler to do than all the core tech stuff we\u2019ve been working on like planets, making the game 64 bit etc. The main things we\u2019ve got left now, the planetary stuff is there although we\u2019re continuing to refine it, the AI in terms of both the subsumption walkabout AI as well as the combat AI, although they work it\u2019s not to the level that we\u2019re happy with yet and also then the object container stuff.<br /><br/>Object containers, all they do is say \u201csomething is here\u201d and then as you get closer to them, they say \u201cOK, you\u2019re getting closer, now I need to load\u201d and it could be layers like just external stuff you can see initially and then internal stuff. Right now what we\u2019re working on is the intelligence for when things stream in which is what we need for the next big release. Once we have that, core tech is basically done and then it\u2019s about layering on a bunch of very cool gameplay.<br /><br/>So with the next big release a lot of the underlying game is there and then we can look at transferring people between servers so we can have hundreds of thousands of people maybe in one instance, but that doesn\u2019t come online until later.<br /><br/>Planets are great but we need to generate the content there for the players to consume, like the homestead mission you saw, somebody perhaps takes a rescue mission to a planet and maybe it\u2019s a trap and you\u2019re ambushed, or maybe another time it\u2019s just a simple rescue mission, or we have ground vehicle racing on planets etc. We also don\u2019t want to have you coming to planet where you just use your ship and shoot everything easily, the balance should make it so that you have to physically land your ship and come out on the ground whether there are air defences or something else to force you down.<br /><br/>", "published_at": "2017-02-17", "title": "The Star Citizen Exclusive Interview: Erin Roberts", "source": "http://wccftech.com/star-citizen-exclusive-interview-erin-roberts/", "type": "article", "user": "Adrian Ip", "published_at_timestamp": 1487289600}, {"objectID": "373672900", "question": "Will animations adapt to our character as they get older or recover from past injuries?

The first procedural planet really had nothing to do with the aesthetics, hey were we trying to pull off aesthetically... nothing.To be honest with you it was just about proving tech so textures were pulled in of a certain memory footprint that we knew we would most likely have and then the tech was just pushed until we got that up and running. After those first steps then we had an environment artist 100% dedicated to working with all of the tech guys and engineers that were pushing on procedural planets.They needed to sort out the best approach on how to get rid of seams, how to make those nonexistent. What limitations and parameters should or shouldn't be set, on and on and on. There's so much detail that's going into that, now work is honestly right now as of this moment going on to some extent but a huge progress is being made. We've already done tests with different types of geometry and different types of look and different type of atmospherics, to really see what we can come up with.One thing that was interesting is Pascal our environment artist was working on stuff, he'd been playing with this one planet and mind you it's huge, for a good amount of time, a couple weeks I think. At one point he kind of made some noise and some of the guys had come over and looked, he had actually seen something like a new formation that he hadn't seen although he'd been looking at this thing for, you know, weeks... in getting to a new part he'd seen a new formation look really, really cool but was completely unique to anything else he'd seen over the last couple of weeks.

Such as if you push your engines too hard or one fails you can turn up/down the power or fuel mixture.", "answer": "Yes there definitely will be along the same lines as all the Item 2.0 stuff that I was just describing. The more ... bigger ships will allow the engineer to have more control over various items or components of the ship, one of which could be the engines, and there'll be the potential to try to push more power out of it. We may even sell \"engine overclocking\" style modules that you could put in for a racer ship or something. And it's always a trade off: putting a bit more fuel or power into it potentially could increase the heat output but maybe also damage your ship.So we're going to have that whole overclocking style set up that we've talked about for weapons and it would be things for like engines and thrusters too. And that's definitely on the bigger ships where the engineer comes in and they are tweaking and doing that and adjusting it based on what they are seeing on the feedback loops. And I think it will be pretty cool.So those are all things that we are doing. That's all why were are trying to make the components of the ship, what we call items but they are components ... and by the way they're not just for spaceships they can be on a vehicle, like a rover or something or a buggy; they're on players, like if you're running around in your armour suit then you'll essentially be ... you'll have your armour suit on and it'll have a power plant on the back to power it for instance and a little life support item on the back, and if you've got EVA you'll have an EVA item attached to you. So players are set up the same way we set ships up. And weapons, guns, are the same: the ammo magazine is an item that plugs into the gun item. If you wanted to put a scope on top that plugs in. A silencer would plug on the front. So it all uses the same interconnected, what we call, \"items\" and \"item ports\" although really that's ... I say it's \"Entity 2.0\" rather than \"Item 2.0\" because really this is the paradigm that works for everything we have. So it would be stuff that a player uses, plugs into; stuff a space ship uses; stuff that vehicles use.

Alien races right? Forest what's different? We got Jeremiah Lee here right? One of our Concept Artists who is doing a lot characters, a lot of human characters. What's the difference what goes into making an alien race besides concepting?FS: Well, you have your humans and then you already know what your skin tone is going to be  like you have a certain range in your height, you know your anatomy is going to be and how the character moves. There's a lot of things that go into an alien race however. How humanoid is it? Does it have four legs? Does it have two legs? How are the legs shaped? How does it move? So I think a lot of the times you get your inspiration from real life creatures and real life animals and then you start merging them together to make new species.Then you also have to think about what kind of environments do they live in? What kind of worlds do they live in? That way you start understanding how their skin tone works because their skin tone probably evolve differently based on their environments right? So in a more icy environments you're probably going to have more hair and stuff like that. In a hotter environment you're probably going to have less hair right? Then the colours of the skin tone and then how do you want the skin tone to react when light hits it? Do you want it to be more like deep underwater jelly fish where it can absorb light and then be somewhat transparent where you kind of see the inner workings of what's happening. Or is it going to be rough and tough and feel more like you can't penetrate this skin. So a lot of those questions are asked when you start introducing alien races. So it's super fun.EKD: It is! And I would say on the production side it doesn't really change much. You and I have been developing or working hard on this, really establishing design, sit down and put their designs together before we even start concepting. Those guys, there's a lot of great things that they can come up with as conceptors. Brilliant, very creative but the Designers tend to know.and the Writers know where this, how this fits in the universe.So in the Ten For The Writers i'm sure they talked about this and the Designers. But then you get all of that content that Forest was just talking about before you even get into making the image. There will I think be some back and forth like: \"Oh that doesn't really make sense\". Or \"I want to dig into that more.\" Or \"I have some ideas\" And that's totally cool that's where the back and forth goes.FS: And you're always going to find a limitation in the tech right?EKD: Totally, yeah.FS: Potentially have to write new shaders to react to determine how the skin reacts, the lighting and stuff like that. So it does impact the schedule a little bit depending.It's all about a balance. You want to push it as far as the Writers and the Designers wanted to go but still keep it in the boundaries of how much time you actually have and how limited your resources are.EKD: And even animation. I feel like, if it's just pure concepting you just come up with an idea. People do this all the time for personal work but in this environment then once you get this concept you would take it to the Animation Director and say \"What are my limitations here. In the system as well as what you need\" And that may even go back to be tweaked based on that.FS: Are we going to need to make a brand new rig? How are we going to Motion Capture this? That's the other thing that get's really interesting like we did with the Vanduul right? Is the Motion Capture. How do you have humanoids move and you know, talk? It's pretty serious. So you got to be kind of creative and you got almost build these sets, like these suits and stuff that they could potentially wear to see where like, the collar, and how do they move? It's a tricky thing. It's one of the funnest things right? It really allows you to be creative about the process.EKD: There's just so much that goes into making a concept for an alien race. It's not just make this guy it's like \"Here are all the implications\". Alright next question.FS: And hopefully we'll have languages or something.EKD: Hopefully we'll have languages. Maybe.

Looking into putting another set of size 2 lasers on the top of the ship to give it some extra armament it's going to be one medium shield it's a rather large ship when it is open and flying so we wanted to give it some additional protection from forward facing shots. It's going to have two possible four small power plants and much like the Herald is going to have it's going to have one small jump drive. Because it is smaller than I believe the Endeavour (possibly means Herald?) it is going to be able to utilise any sized jump point.It won't have any trouble using any of the jump points in the PU. Its top speed is going to be 270 metres a second this is opposed to the Hornets 200 metres a second so it's going to be a very fast manoeuvrable ship there is no interior space plan.

Only a very few wouldn't have a quantum drive.

And then you've got the next level of a ship that would maybe have Quantum drive, but maybe doesn't have a jump drive. Or maybe doesn't have a jump drive installed, so they can travel around the star system pretty quickly but if they want to go to another star system they would have to travel, or be put in the hold of a bigger ship, or get a jump drive installed, and then the bigger, most starfaring ships which, at a certain level most of our biggest ships have jump drives. They can jump between systems, and you have different levels of that, cause you've got ships that could jump to another system, but they couldn't head off into open space and jump system after system, they just don't have fuel or life-support reserves, whereas some ships like the Carrack was made for deep-space exploration, so they've got extra fuel tanks and extra range, and the capacity to do multiple jumps without having to restock or replenish.So, I think those are the various tiers of stuff.

Can you tell us a little bit about how you approach it? Also, some RPGs tend to fall into dialogue trees whose branches all just loop back to the same options, and only amount to skipping or re-ordering parts of the conversation -- you can keep asking questions about different topics until you've \"caught them all\". Is that something you're looking to avoid in favour of a more natural feel/flow in Star Citizen conversations?", "answer": "Will Weissbaum: So, Chris' marching orders from the get-go has always been: Immersion. And being able to go back and re-ask questions all over and just have these kind of looping cycles of narrative definitely break that. So, from the get-go it's always been: if you miss a conversation, you miss it. You can't really re-trigger them and if there is a branch and you choose one of the branches, you don't get to see the other one. That's your choice and you kind of have to live with that. And putting those stakes that high - knowing that these conversations are kind of delicate flowers for you to experience, I think, gives them more value and weight and hopefully will make them more engaging in that if you want to find our more about characters that you really have to actively engage with the NPCs rather than just clicking on them and going through these big cycling loops.So, we're still definitely fleshing out the whole conversation system and we've been doing some awesome stuff with the Squadron 42 shoot that's going on right now that I'm really excited about. So, yeah it's pretty cool. I think.Adam Wieser: The first question, the process behind it... I haven't done as many interactive conversations yet as he [points at Will] has obviously, doing a lot of the squadron 42 work... but I do think the process of actually writing branching conversations is really interesting, at least from a writing perspective... and it can be difficult but if you know the character, if you know who's saying it, then it's just about modulating their responses based on the way it goes. So, it's actually something that I find a lot of fun to do and it's kind of interesting to do... to be able to really understand a character by getting not only one view of their relationship to a subject or an answer but a stream of them. So, it's something that, when I get a chance to do it, I definitely like doing it.WW: Yeah, it's... the process, or at least how I approach it, is when you come to that question of when it feels like the player has two possible things... like, it makes sense for you to be able to go in two different directions. Like, it's not a clear answer... and that's when we say, \"Alright, this is the perfect place for a branch.\" We try to come up with two big differences. If both answers feel very similar, then why are we doing the branch? We might as well just have the answer be what it is. So, kind of the first step is thinking, \"Alright, what are the two things you can say in this situation,\" and then thinking about the NPCs reaction to those and where it goes off from there and then further branching... and then it can get a mess really fast.Right now we're using traditional screenwriting software to do the branching dialogue stuff which has its own sort of problems.

So, hardpoints in general that we've been talking about &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; actually, there was a design post about itemports, right? So everything in the ship is actually attached to an itemport:&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Thrusters&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Radar&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Ship's computer&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Fuel tank&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Powerplant&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Turrets&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Weapons&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Missiles&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; ArmourSo, all of those are actually items that plug into the ship and they require their own level of power, they emit heat, they may require data &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; all these different pipes that hook into each other. The functionality comes with the item, so to speak, so the hull itself... if you took the thrusters, the powerplant, and all these things out it would just be a floating hull &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; it wouldn't be able to do anything. That's kind of the modular system we have for the ships. We're only really publicizing the hardpoints related to the weapons because that's what people care about. In reality we have a lot more hardpoints and other hardpoints would entail... like a hardpoint where you can switch the crew module out for a science module or something like that.So, to think that a more specialized ship has less hardpoints is actually incorrect, it probably has at least as many &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; they just happen to be attaching extra things. For instance, a good example would be the Orion which we just had and was in a previously question. You can see on the outside of it there are all these containers, right, well each container &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; which is a fairly big container (6 m x 4 m x 2 m) &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; attaches to an itemport... that's more itemports than any one of our combat ships have had. So, there's plenty of option to expand &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; you may not realize it from the website because that's using outdated data that over time we will change. But also it's kind of hard because it's not standardized... one ship could have 100 different itemports and one ship could have 30 itemports and it sort of all depends on the itemports that are specific to their particular uses which could be anything &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; like mounting a cargo module or mounting a gun.I would say that non-combat ships will definitely stay relevant and will be able to change out and do things, functionality wise, at least as much as a combat ship and maybe even more so.", "published_at": "2015-03-23", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 57 (2015.03.23)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Aoooemaw2lY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "TheWhiteKnight", "published_at_timestamp": 1427148202}, {"objectID": "373683430", "question": "As you know when new MMOs get launched, most of the time they are plagued by gold farmers and gold sellers and bot-ing. Well maybe in this case UEC farmers and sellers. They tend to affect economy and many other various things. How are you going to approach this issue with the economy being so important to the PU?", "answer": "We're pretty aware of the gold farmer, gold seller, and the \"botting\" side. It's one of the reasons why the one form of revenue that we were thinking the game would have, besides selling the initial package (because we're not gonna have subscriptions like you have typically on World of Warcraft or something) is that we would sell UEC credits within a certain limited amount to players. So you don't actually have to go and buy it from someone farming, because that's always going to happen. We're sort of thinking of different ways that allow money transfers to happen in the game, that hopefully potentially could curtail a certain amount of gold farming, and all that kind of stuff. I will say that in general it's pretty hard to clamp that down because people can always even sell an account if you prevent people from sending money to someone else inside the game. We haven't made all the full rules, but in our universe it will be like the real world, so you just can't willy nilly transfer money and transfer items and equipment to other people without having to pay some form of... you know, like in the real world, you have to transfer title and it costs you to transfer title on a car, and if you give people something they have to pay taxes... and so we have various things that are trying to be like the real world in the Persistent Universe design that will hopefully replicate some stuff that's in the real world. And some of that may or may not help to reduce some of the \"botting\" and the gold farming. I think the biggest thing is if they can get it from a trusted source, i.e us, and that's all guaranteed, then you'd tend to go for that unless someone is radically undercutting you on prices, and that's obviously something that we would try to go after because we don't want to have the game destroyed by someone saying \"here, I'm gonna sell you my account and I've got 20 billion credits in it. I'll give it to you for 5 dollars!\" ... Those are all sort of things that would be no-nos against our policies. But like I said it's early days, so we'll see. It's always a constant struggle, and I think no one has got a magic silver bullet for that, but we're aware and we've got quite a few people that have worked on some big MMOs and so they have some ideas and solutions, but I don't want to share too many of them because obviously you want to keep some of that in reserve.", "published_at": "2014-07-14", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 29.

The more expensive or more experience NPC is probably, if he's a pilot he's better pilot, if he's a gunner, a better gunner, and you'll definitely be able to see their status.I mean I think the way to think about it would be we're not going to do it in an abstract manner like you would typically see in an RPG where it would be like \"this guy's got aiming skill of 20 and this guy's only got an aiming skill of 15.\" It would be more that you would have the review, so think of it like a hiring board for NPCs like you get on Craig's List or Ebay and you would have \"I'm so and so and I love to shoot things in my turret\" and then there's a bunch of sort of the equivalent of Yelp reviews where people would be like \"He's fantastic, he's a crack shot\" and you would get the idea of the skill level based on the price and the reviews. Some of those reviews would be the in-fiction level of reviews for the NPC.We'll try and dress up how good a pilot is based in the fiction of the world, but that will give you an idea. You won't necessarily know the behind the scenes numbers of how skilled they are, but you'll get a good idea of \"this is an experienced pilot\" or \"this is rookie pilot.\" And you pay more for the more experienced guys than you do for the rookie ones, but of course the rookie ones potentially could learn and become a veteran guy over time.", "published_at": "2014-05-26", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 22.

So we'll have the ability to record actor's voice, for VO and stuff, and do sound balancing here and in Austin, and we'll make sure they're both connected. We have actually a gigabyte internet, fiber, running from here to Austin. So we'll be able to do a fair amount of that.I actually haven't heard of real time voice porting, so I guess I'll go and google it and find out what it is. It could be you're in Austin and you've got an actor in Los Angeles, and you're basically directing your VO long distance, which we will have the ability to do in our stages.But yeah, we're gonna have a full featured sound set-up here, and sound's an important part of the game, so we're really focusing on quite a few things.We're gonna be enhancing the sound system inside Star Citizen. We're gonna make a move to WI's from Fmod. It just has some more real time filters and plug-ins that are good for the sound guys. The sound guys like to use it for the sound editing, and we're really working hard on how to make a realistic sound-scape, and also we're gonna have some great dynamic music.Anyway, we're pretty focused on the sound, although you haven't really appreciated it yet.
