Born in 2742, he was the only son of Pax Harris and Ndilimeke Arnold, real estate moguls on Terra (Terra III). He graduated from the Astronautics Laboratory within the Martian Institute of Space Technology (MIST), where he was first exposed to the works of deceased spacecraft designer Leonard Casse, whose portfolio strongly influenced Arnold's future designs. In 2772, he founded Anvil Aerospace, which went on to become one of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) military's premier shipbuilders. Arnold insisted on personally approving every part of his vehicles' designs while he served as CEO. His policies of profit-sharing with his workers and fostering the talents of promising employees at Anvil led to the launch of many successful careers, and made him a popular figure in the often cutthroat spacecraft manufacturing industry. He died of old age in 2853. </p><br/><h1>CAREER</h1><br/><p>Arnold began his career as a junior designer at Aegis Dynamics in 2763, where he would eventually be assigned to assist on Project Monitor, developing the vehicle which would become the Hammerhead. A design of his was selected to be made into one of six prototypes, but it was not ultimately delivered to the UEE Navy (UEEN) after it failed early flight tests. Arnold became demoralized with his job after a lack of feedback from his supervisors, especially after repeated rejections of new designs following his failed prototype. In his spare time, he began to sketch ideas for ships based on the creations of his favorite designer, Leonard Casse. </p><br/><p>It became apparent to Arnold by 2770 that he had no path forward at Aegis. He decided to quit his position and accepted a seed loan from his parents to start his own ship manufacturing company, which he planned to operate based on the flat organization style that was used at Casse Aerospace. Under this style of management, everyone's opinions would be given equal weight no matter their status, with all final decisions left to Arnold. Although this would cause a long development process, Arnold felt that worker satisfaction would lead to a stronger final product.</p><br/><p>In 2772, construction on his new shipbuilding facility in Nova Kyiv, Terra was complete. Arnold named the new company Anvil Aerospace in reference to former MIST professor Robert Calvin's famous assertion from his book <em>Mechanisms of Empire</em> that military spending \"...fuels the furnaces of expansion and strikes the anvils of innovation.\" Within the first year, Arnold and his team had created a prototype fighter called the Osprey. As an homage to Casse, Arnold included signature elements from Casse's ships such as curved wings and the open circle signet in his own designs.</p><br/><p>Using connections he had made during his time at Aegis, Arnold showed the prototype to a small gathering of Navy officials. The ship proved to be a hit and the Navy placed Anvil's first ever order. As word spread of the new manufacturer's successful entry into the military market, it caught the eye of the holding firm that owned the rights to the Casse Aerospace portfolio, which sued Arnold for copyright infringement. Facing a potentially devastating lawsuit, Arnold chose to settle the case by purchasing all of Casse Aerospace's portfolio for an undisclosed sum. Arnold released a public statement that Anvil would continue to utilize Casse's signature elements in their ships as an ode to a talented designer who died far too young. </p><br/><p>After the events of the anti-Messer revolution in 2792, the UEE stripped Aegis Dynamics of most of its contracts due to its strong association with the Messer regime. As a part of the UEE Navy's defensive restructure focused on protecting and serving the civilian population, Anvil Aerospace was approached by Vice Admiral Galen Whishaw of the UEEN Research &amp; Development Division, who offered Anvil a direct contract to develop a brand new ship. The result was the U4A-3 Terrapin, a design that Arnold had been working on with lead engineer Allegra Wilsing. The successful deployment of that ship in 2796 helped to make Arnold and his company an indispensable part of the UEE's defense. Over the next few decades, Arnold personally supervised the development of all Anvil's military ships, most notably the F7A Hornet, which replaced the Aegis Avenger as the UEE's standard front-line fighter.</p><br/><h1>LATER LIFE</h1><br/><p>In semi-retirement by the early 2840s, Arnold nevertheless still required that all parts of a ship's development be approved by him. On a trip to MacArthur (Kilian V) in 2850, he is reported to have been evaluating changes made to Anvil's many projects on his mobiGlas in between meetings with UEEN leadership. He served as a guest lecturer at MIST in 2851 and was invited to return the following year, but he declined, citing a desire to return \"home\" to the Anvil offices in Nova Kyiv. He died at his desk in 2853.

Kossi began his political career after his honorable discharge from the UEE Navy, where he received a Medal of Valor for his service during a dangerous repair mission under fire from the Vanduul. After a race against Gabrielle Graci\u00e1n and Sakae Marigold, he became the first Tevarin to be elected to the office of Senator in 2946. He was re-elected in 2951.</p><br/><h1>EARLY LIFE</h1><br/><p>Kossi was the second youngest child of six children, born in 2900 to Sei Kossi and Qy Rusfa in the hills outside Gemma, Jalan. His parents and extended family, who shared Kossi's home, were career criminals who primarily targeted and robbed homes, outposts, or other potentially profitable locations. From the time he was ten, he joined his family on low-risk raids, eventually taking on more dangerous tasks after he turned fifteen. In 2919, a raid on a water farm outside Nedila erupted in violence, and Kossi's eldest sister Fef Rusfa was killed in the firefight, alongside all three of the farmers who had tried to defend their home. In the aftermath, Kossi and his surviving family members learned that all of the farm's equipment was broken, and there was nothing worth stealing. Overcome with a feeling that his sister had died for nothing and he'd wasted his life, Kossi ran away from his family and enlisted in the UEE Army.</p><br/><h1>MILITARY CAREER</h1><br/><p>For six years, Kossi served with distinction, reaching the rank of Sergeant in 2925. He was selected soon after for a transfer to the Navy for flight training. As a pilot, he ran sensor repair missions until 2928, when a surprise Vanduul raid interrupted what should have been a routine mission in the Oberon system. Kossi used his ship to shield three technicians under his command from ongoing enemy fire, saving their lives at the cost of sustaining grievous injuries. He spent the next sixteen months in an intensive care unit. Though he recovered, long-term effects from his injuries ended his military career. Kossi was awarded Citizenship, the Medal of Valor, and an honorable discharge for his service.</p><br/><h1>POLITICAL CAREER</h1><br/><p>Kossi moved to an apartment owned by Ustiel Housing Development, a small corporation that owned and managed a handful of low to middle-income habitations around Gemma. After his neighbors suffered a series of unjust evictions after weeks of intimidation tactics from their building manager, he conducted some research and noticed that this pattern occurred across all properties owned by Ustiel stretching back 15 years. Kossi responded by organizing a class-action lawsuit that eventually resulted in a criminal inquiry. </p><br/><p>In 2933, Kossi ran for a position on the Gemma city council, which he lost. Undeterred, he ran again in 2937 and was elected based on a platform of ensuring housing equality. He began to appear on local news programs as an advocate for renters and a de facto spokesperson for Tevarin, a role which earned him some criticism from the Tevarin community. After successfully enacting a rent-control ordinance in 2944 during his second term, Kossi announced his intention to run as Senator on the Universalist ticket. In 2946, he temporarily suspended his campaign for a week following the Battle for Vega II to report for duty with the Naval Reserves. Analysts believe that this action pushed his poll numbers high enough to ensure his successful election at the end of the year.</p><br/><p>Since taking office, Kossi co-authored several important pieces of legislation, sat on the Subcommittee on the Interior, led outreach programs to raise the Tevarin vote, and became a regular guest on popular spectrum news programs. He is a strong supporter of loosening current Citizenship requirements and expanding enfranchisement across the UEE. After Laylani Addison became Imperator in 2950, he worked with her to draft legislation that would create programs to incentivize Tevarin involvement in the public sector. He was re-elected in 2951. Koto Dodson of the Terra Gazette has speculated that Kossi will run for Imperator in 2960, a rumor that the Universalist party has neither confirmed nor denied.

What\u2019s that been like?", "answer": "It\u2019s been a lot of fun and a lot of work. It\u2019s pretty amazing, because I never guessed it would\u2019ve turned into what it\u2019s turned into when we started out. I was just hoping there was a big enough group of people out there that still wanted a space game like the kind I made so I could go off and make it. Obviously we\u2019re way beyond that. We\u2019ve been able to build this really large company that\u2019s dedicated to making the best space game possible. We now have over 360 people in four studios spread between L.A., Austin, Manchester and Frankfurt. We also have folks working on it up in Montreal. It\u2019s pretty amazing that from this one idea, this big company has grown and evolved, and of course that comes with its own set of work. There\u2019s a challenge to build and grow a company while trying to build a really ambitious game.<br /><br />And it\u2019s really interesting that we\u2019re doing it in public. All the past games I\u2019ve built have been built behind closed doors, and have been funded by a publisher. You\u2019d go off and work on something for several years before you even show it to people. With Star Citizen, from the very beginning, we were just like, \u201cHey! This is what we\u2019re doing!\u201d That is exhilarating, and it\u2019s great to get feedback and all that stuff, but of course that can have unfavorable consequences. But I\u2019d rather take the good with the bad.<br /><br />The biggest takeaway for me is the community. In the past, all the games I\u2019ve made \u2014 I knew that people liked them, they got all these reviews \u2014 but you never really connected to the people that liked the game or what you were doing. That\u2019s not what happens with a crowdfunded game. We have this huge, supportive community, and over the last four years they\u2019ve supported us to a level no other crowdfunding game has seen before. They make this game possible. It\u2019s amazing to see their excitement and enthusiasm.<br /><br />You have this direct connection to the players, and there\u2019s something really cool about that \u2014 not just for me, but for a lot of the people working on this stuff. When they build a cool ship or they build a cool feature, all these people say, \u201cAhh, I really like that, it\u2019s really cool!\u201d A lot of times when you\u2019re creating something, you\u2019re doing it for yourself, but you also want to do it so other people enjoy it. If you\u2019re working on a triple-A game, you could be locked up for four years before knowing whether anyone likes it or not or is even excited about it. In our case, we know there\u2019s a big community out there that\u2019s super excited and can\u2019t get enough of it.", "title": "Meet the Man Behind \u2018Star Citizen,\u2019 the Most Ambitious Video Game Ever", "source": "https://gearpatrol.com/2016/10/06/interview-chris-roberts-star-citizen-creator/", "type": "article", "user": "Michael Finn", "published_at_timestamp": 1475712000}, {"objectID": "373686440", "question": "What skills are required to get a job in DevOps?", "answer": "It varies from company to company.

So the harvesters are harvesting resources from the worlds they're sort of conquering or destroying and that's sort of turned into the you know, utilized by the Vanduul warmachine to make their fleet bigger and make their fleet stronger. So we definitely will probably have them appearing and obviously Vanduul appearing in the bigger Star Citizen when we get to the worlds that Vanduul are kind of... or the systems that the Vanduul are present in or are threatening.So planetary landing and procedural planets are a big part of the game and they actually will also be apart of Squadron 42. We're planning and utilizing the technology, not just in Star Citizen, but in Squadron 42 for some of the locations you'll visit just because the idea of sort of seamless flying around from you know, you can see off in the distance a little dot and then you fly up to it and it turns into a moon and you fly down onto it and go right down to a gas refining facility and then fight pirates there or whatever you'll be doing.It's amazing to just have sense of scale of scope and it's all there and there's no tricks where there's a loading screen or there's suddenly clouds in your way and then we've streamed in a level, it's all there in one coherent world, all in the same 64-bit vector space and you know, the planets or the planetoids cause you know obviously we also use for moons or whatever, they you know, [Creates a ball with his hand and moves his hand around it] I can see it here, I can land here and gravity works all around it and you can literally walk all the around the planet or fly all the way around it.So we build ground vehicles or we just announced this Dragonfly sale which is also sort of a space bike, but a ground bike and it's good for zipping around there and it's going to be super cool. So we're going to be using that for everything, including Squadron 42 and in the PU I would say that the big difference between what I was thinking that we were going to do a few years ago and what we can do now is there's going to be so much more gameplay and content in individual systems because we can literally have every moon and every planet be something you can: fly, land on, walk around, move around, mine things on, search for things, rescue people on, get jumped by pirates on. So there's not just for potential for missions spawning in space, there's potentially for all sorts of missions to spawn on down planets just like they'll be missions that could spawn on space stations or missions spawning on space wrecks hanging out in asteroid fields. So the amount of gameplay that's opened up in the same area you'll have, it's exponentially more gameplay and it's really, really, really cool.And the Vanduul harvesters just could be apart of that.", "title": "Star Citizen: 10 for the Chairman - Episode 85", "source": "https://youtu.be/9IubH4hHIFw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Vacation", "published_at_timestamp": 1466460877}, {"objectID": "373675910", "answer": "Will Weissbaum: So to start off, I think the inspiration comes from a lot of places. A lot of times you'll just be driving home and an idea will pop in your head and you'll come in really jazzed and it will really flow from you. But a lot of times having a creative job, it's the job portion of it where you have to have the discipline to come in and write and generate ideas on demand, and that's the difficult part.We all have an office together and it's really helpful to be able to turn around and toss out ideas. So sometimes we'll sit around and do brain storm sessions where we use shared documents to share ideas with each other and that's a life saver! I don't know how it is as an artist having that forced creativity come about.Jeremiah Lee: Yeah, it's pretty similar but the difference would be the writers would come up with a backbone for the visuals, for the concepts. But we have to flesh those concepts out and sometimes the definitions of a character or an idea are very broad so we'd have to fill those in and that's where the creativity comes in. Which is very close too, since we work with other artists, we bounce back ideas. Sometimes, like for the John Rhys-Davies character, you and I, we chatted quite a lot actually just regarding the outfit.WW: Yeah, it was pretty fun coming at it from his background and how that translated into the materials or the designs.JL: Right, right. So art is pretty much similar. I mean sometimes we do have \"artist's block\" and we're like \"oh no what do we do, it's due in two hours but we don't know ... !\"WW: So how do you get past your \"artist's block\"?JL: For me it's research.WW: Okay.JL: There's a plethora of information out there and so, if I'm designing a leather jacket, I don't just type in \"leather jacket\" on Google. I might ...WW: You should! That would probably be a good place to start! [laughs]JL: Yeah that would be. But if I want something original I'd search for things that might be related, so I might do like \"motorcycle outfit\" or like, I don't know, \"World War II\" and maybe if  I see some cool shapes I might implement it into a leather jacket or something. So that's my way of getting round the \"artist's block\".WW: Yeah, research can be very helpful to take a break and do it online. I find myself getting caught in \"research loops\" though because I love learning.JL: Yes!WW: So I'll start looking up stuff and ten minutes later you are somewhere completely different on Wikipedia and you're like \"okay, I got to actually go back\". And then, probably the biggest thing I would say, that took me a while to learn, is even when you don't feel inspired or you feel like you don't have a good idea is just to put out whatever you do have in your head and oftentimes just dumping out that first pass will let you be like \"well that's stupid but this would be cool\" and then you can revise from that. But staring at blank sheet, or blank canvas, is the really daunting part.JL: Oh, gosh yeah!WW: So if you can just start filling that in with whatever then that a huge grab.[referring back to the question] And so stories about the relationship between the races? Yeah, hopefully. We have a lot of discussions going on behind the scenes about the races and how the different alien species are going to interact with each other. And so we're planning on how we are going to roll out that content. And we are still working with various different authors to generate material for the Jump Points mainly right now.

I logged in when this was happening.MS: So just for a little bit of context the incident in question is what was described. So a virus got unleashed into a massive populous.DH: It was a bug. There was a DOT.MS: Yes, there was a debuff effect that was causing this virus and it wasn't intended that it was going to wipe out the world but it did.DH: Yeah the timer wouldn't end. And it was contagious.MS: Yeah, very contagious. So the high-level idea of this, where you do have this uncontrollable viral outbreak is an insanely cool high-level thing, but something to consider with it is just how destructive that is. In this example it even as it says here players-forced euthanasia or government-forced euthanasia. That was how that situation had to be contained. Entire player, well not player cities, but like main hubs ...DH: Ogrimmar.MS: ... in the game had to be just wiped out, every living thing had to die! So to do that for the PU, having some sort of a viral incident: definitely want to explore that. Having it be something that could contaminate and infect the entire universe is a little less likely.DH: And that's a huge content shift.MS: Because that would effectively be like \"cool, let's just eradicate Terra and everyone who lives on there\". And it's not really the friendliest option.DH: And also that becomes the story. You can't do \"I'm going to pick up three tonnes of iron ore and move it to Stanton because, oh my god, there's a pandemic making people bleed on me\". It feels like everything else grinds to a halt. That was a thing like I mentioned: I logged in randomly while that event was going on and I spawned in Ogrimmar and there were just corpses everywhere, and I had no idea what was going on so I just took off because I saw bleeding people and just started running. So it's a great narrative hook, no doubt, but it would be dangerous.MS: The dangers of it are definitely there. Although even on a smaller scale like having a ship-wide event, that's probably something you could see. So you're doing some research on your Endeavour or other science type ship, and something goes wrong there, that could definitely be more of a case where it's that same kind of fear and same kind of panic but in a much more controllable scale where billions of entities won't have to die just to get things back to normal.DH: There could even be a planet that needs to be quarantined because they have a thing but then again it feels like it's a very guarded type thing where it's like \"oh well they need more resources to maintain this quarantine\" then maybe you can have the narrative hook of \"oh the quarantine starts to fail\". But again that feels more kind of a scripted thing rather than just creating a virus bug and just letting it go and run rampant.MS: So it's definitely something that we want to explore but it is making sure that we can explore it without being too punishing to everyone else who may not find viral outbreaks the most valuable use of their gaming hours.", "published_at_timestamp": 1451344698, "question": "Has the idea of terminal illness or genuine disease been discussed?

I'm curious if this simple add-in by developers would cause the entire verse to go nuts, both 'government' and player-forced euthanasia, extreme traffic control/blockades....that sort of thing. The point is that player psychology would be studied for decades by IRL teachers/students doing term papers...etc about how in-game players react to a pandemic, was there blood/did they handle it well, how different was it to a real scenario? So devs don't even need to set up the government, let the players do the work and I bet dollars to donuts the publicity would go through the roof.

And then, potentially, if you're talking between someone on that frequency, depending on the ship and equipment, someone else could potentially snoop on it depending on what they've got. Not all the time but some people would. So we'll allow you to hail ships and open secure transmissions with them or just generally broadcast stuff and go from there.

Or will the existing two be expanded?", "answer": "First of all, I think we're starting to, well not really starting to, we've decided it's not really Arena Commander that we're dropping, we're dropping multi-crew which is really, we've been calling it SC Alpha for awhile, but SC Alpha as we drop with the multicrew will have Arena Commander inside of it, it will have Star Marine inside it, it will have the social Planetside inside it.  Plus, you'll be playing on a brand new map, so I think I've talked about this before.  It's a large world map, it's much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, MUCH, MUCH BIGGER than the Arena Commander maps, which are limited to I think about 8 to 10 km in diameter.  For this map, it's hundreds of thousands or millions of kilometers in size, so it's geometrically larger by a long way.  It's setup to be more like the persistent universe, it's not meant to be a simulation the way Arena Commander itself is, which is a bit more gamey.  You are going to spawn on a space station the way you saw at the Gamescom demo.  You'll be able to go to different panels and say \"Oh, I want to pull up this ship from my account\", and say you own a Constellation, so it will say \"Yup, Constellation is on Landing Pad 3\", and then you can go over to Landing Pad 3.  It'll be keyed only for you use and once you've used it, your other friends can come and join you and you can take off from Landing Pad 3.  We'll have a safe zone surrounding the starting space station, and it will be a station similar to what you saw at Gamescom, but with more stuff and more additions and then there will be other areas you can go and explore.  So you could go and explore other space stations, other moons, asteroid fields, communication satellites that you'll be able to hack into and get information, and destinations you'll be able to go and fly.  There will be areas you can go and salvage stuff, reclaim stuff.  There's some asteroids, some space stations, there's some stuff where you'll be able to go and have PVP fights inside as well as on ships, there will be weapons you'll be able to salvage and scavenge, it's going to be kinda fun.  It's going to be kind of a mini little game, much more free form and allow more things for players to do.  So yeah, it's a pretty big map, and it's got a lot more than any of our other stuff has, and there'll be a fair amount of stuff for people to do.  We're interested in seeing what happens.  There will be random AI encounters you can go and find, sort of have a more single player experience, but there'll be other areas where it'll be okay to fight other players and then you can have at it.  Yeah, it's going to be a fun, free form experience and like I said, it's our version of the test kitchen of the Persistent Universe, where we'll start to roll out new functionality and new testing.  We get minable asteroids happening with the voxel tech we want to work on, put asteroids out there you can go mine, you can have that happening.  You want to have a cargo mission where you go from A to B, those kinds of things would start to happen and spawn on here.  That's what we're calling our large world map, Crusader, is the name of the map, and it's based around the gas giant of Crusader.  Instead of adding new maps, we'll probably just keep adding points of interest because we're on a large world map so the thing is massive.  It could be a couple billion kilometers across, so we'll be able to keep on adding points of interest.  There will be places where you can repair your ship, there will be places where you can refuel.  So yeah, a big difference between Arena Commander and what we are calling SC Alpha.  Obviously then, we start expanding on that, because then at some point we'll let you go down and land on a planet, and then you'll be on the Planetside location as you've been seeing in ArcCorp.  You can also buy and sell stuff, and then take off and go to other places.  That's basically the Star Citizen game cycle, and then we keep adding more functionality, more locations, open up more jump points and then go on from there.  It's going to be cool, and we'll be giving you the first drop of SC Alpha/multicrew ready for you after Citizen Con, so end of October.  We're feeling pretty optimistic about being able to do that, but you know, that's still a little ways off, so don't shoot me if something blows up and goes wrong.  So far, in what we've got left to do, in terms of scoping it we think we should be on that target, but you're getting it raw from the source, there's no padding in that.  But definitely, you'll be playing it not far after that, and having a good time.  We're excited about it, we're kind of keen to see how people feel about it, because there will be lots of more stuff to do and I'm sure there will be loads of cool videos you guys will be making and we've got a big plan to deliver a lot of content, carrying out from then onwards.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 66", "source": "https://youtu.be/VGTj2iWkS-8", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Nick", "published_at_timestamp": 1442269621}, {"objectID": "373681490", "question": "Now that one of the major directors left for Blizzard, that left us thinking that he didn't have confidence in the project.

We've had people leave for personal reasons, we've had people leave to pursue dreams jobs they've had since they were children. You can have passion and confidence in more than one project at the same time and just because you can only have one job doesn't mean that...DV: On top of that, mobility between companies is a very normal thing especially during the lifespan of a game cycle. At any video game company you're going to see people come and go, it's a very mobile industry that you see a lot of hiring and you see a lot of leaving. So, one person leaving doesn't necessarily mean a nail in the coffin for a project or that the project is now diminished. So, we've hired actually quite a few people within the last year and all these people are equally as passionate as the others. So, you're not going to see a diminishment in the quality of the game, you're not going to see less passion because like I said everyone of us is absolutely passionate for it.LO: The producers who have left recently, just to add, have all been here at least a year or many years, since the beginning of the project. Frankly, I would be worried if you saw a bunch of producers come on, stay three months and leave. That might be a sign of....DV: I think it's a sign of lack of commitment.  LO: Yeah, lack of commitment but that's not what you're seeing here at all.DV: Everybody here is die hard and passionate for the project. We're here for the long haul.

It doesn't mean they're disappointed in the project, it doesn't mean they have less confidence in the project. They have their own reasons. So, ultimately we support people if they want to pursue things outside of the company, we're sad to see them go and thankful for the contribution they've made...LO: We still have great relationships with all of them.DV: Absolutely. I still talk with a lot of old friends who used to be here. So, if you or you know someone who has the skills and passion to help bring this project to reality, closer towards the vision that Chris wants. Please do check out the website, see what opportunities are available. Many of our own artists and employees came from and who were fans before, backers such as artist Elwin who helped contribute to The Next Great Starship.LO: And Gage and Dan...DV: Yep, so we hired them because of skills they demonstrated to us so if they have the passion, if they have skills, please apply. We would love to see you onboard. It's a great team and great project to be a part of.LO: Except for this guy.DV: Yeah, I don't know.LO: [laughs]DV: It's hard to sit next to her.LO: You don't sit next to me anymore.DV: Thank god.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 11", "source": "https://youtu.be/9y1X4tLFdU0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Sultan", "published_at_timestamp": 1439849467}, {"objectID": "afdf14b8d690c_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The Starliner is designed in compartments so that its interior can be very modular.

It'd actually be kind of cool to have a situation where you monitor a team almost like Aliens, that's something we should consider doing because that'd be a really cool role. We were thinking when you land a dropship either the pilot would take off again and go back out, or potentially get out of the ship and join the rest of the team on the assault.

With 10 missions of 30 minutes the first episode would already be as long as some other single-player games.", "answer": "Yes it's going to be quite long. I think Erin and the SQ42 team are estimating that the playtime for SQ42 with 50 missions will be around 50 hours, and that's because the missions themselves will probably take at least 30 minutes, and also between missions you move around the various ships and places you'll be, talking to people, having a sit down, engaging with characters etc, that'll add time to it. The missions are quite involved by the way, they're not just like \"follow a patrol route\", that might be a part of it, but in many cases there's stuff on the ground etc too. The first 10 missions could arguably be equivalent to 20 plus missions in an old school wing commander game. The team at foundry 42 are keen to knock it out of the park, and what they're working on and what they've planned definitely would go head to head with any AAA game on it's own. Period. And that's just one aspect of what we're doing. We've got a full vertical slice of one of the first missions, there's flying around, combat, puzzle solving etc. I think you'll have a lot of fun towards the end of next year, which is when we're giving you that first episode.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 42 (2014.10.20)", "source": "https://youtu.be/paE5gpEdltI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Schwarz", "published_at_timestamp": 1413842404}, {"objectID": "373679150", "question": "Will UEE citizens ever be allowed the opportunity to interact peacefully with the Vanduul, or will the UEE continue to force conflict between our two races?

The UEE doesn't want you selling weapons to the Vanduul, but potentially, you know, someone wants to make a fast buck doing that and deal with the risks. So those are the kind of things we'll do. I'm not sure right now we're gonna have sort of nice, peaceful, pacifist Vanduul, because they're sort of our big Bogeyman in the universe. But there definitely I think will be the chance for people that aren't so UEE friendly, or aligned with the UEE, or care so much about the UEE, to maybe do some trading for profit with the Vanduul.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 34 (2014.08.18)", "source": "https://youtu.be/y4wAP1fWe8c", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Vanduul Veronica", "published_at_timestamp": 1408399954}, {"objectID": "373684820", "question": "Could you please elaborate on the Person of Interest (PoI) system?How will we be setting other people to be PoIs to ourselves?Will it require authorization from the other person, or can anyone set anyone else to be a PoI to them, given that they know the name they're looking for?", "answer": "The idea of the person of interest system is you basically say \"I'm interested in this person over there,\" and the other person doesn't really have any awareness that you've tagged that person as someone that you want the game to let follow.Maybe we would have some devices that you could have to let you know that someone's watching you or snooping on you, which would be sort of like counter insurgency stuff, but the idea of the person of interest system is that way when they leave the planet, you get notified and you have the opportunity to follow them, fly with them in space, and deal with them. It's sort of like tagging someone as a temporary friend. Not that they're necessarily a friend, but it allows you to follow their movements or meet them out in space or track them, which is necessary if you're meant to track someone down for a bounty or whatever.That's kind of how the person of interest system is designed to work, so we'll see how it works in reality, but I'm hoping it will work well, because it will put you together with either your friends or people you're interested in, or people that would be related to what your group is doing, your enemies and stuff.", "title": "10 for the Chairman - Episode 16 .

A Class-5 turret and above are manned turrets, so on a Constellation is two Class-5 turrets, on the back of a Freelancer there's a Class-5 turret. A Class-4 turret is essentially a weapon mount that has either a bigger gun or hardpoints for two smaller guns. So a good example is the Hornet, the ball turret it a Class-4, and also the canard turret is a Class-4. A Class-2 mount is essentially a very small turret that can only fit one smaller gun on. So an example of a Class-2 mount is the wing gatlings on the Hornet for instance. A Class-1 is a fixed mount for a gun. So I hope that explains it to a certain extent. We have actually a bigger setting that goes all the way up to Class-10 for including capital ship mounts. Those things include spinal weapons as well as much bigger turrets that are ship-to-ship.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 07 (2014.02.10)", "source": "https://youtu.be/-y0GQV_Bx4U", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "DragoFire", "published_at_timestamp": 1392073473}]
