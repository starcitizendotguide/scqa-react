Common characteristics of S-pop include the incorporation of relaxing organic-sourced sounds and traditional Saisei instruments. The term can refer either specifically to the popular music of Saisei or to any music functionally derived therefrom. </p><br/><h1>ORIGIN</h1><br/><p>The earliest iteration of traditional Saisei music evolved in the 25th century, when Saisei was first established and built up as a colony world. The form owes a significant amount to the slow, methodical process involved in planning and constructing Saisei colony. While typical colonies grow in fits as interest in particular exports drive commerce and immigration, Seisei was instead built up deliberately according to a long-term plan. Lacking the booms and busts of traditional early colonial development that leave newly settled worlds more closely tied to a home culture, Saisei developed its own disparate takes on a variety of Human art forms. </p><br/><p>During the initial settlement period, luxury imports from Earth (Sol III) were extremely limited. As a result, traditional Human instruments were uncommon beyond those carried as part of the first wave's personal preference kits. Colonists turned to local materials to develop their own offshoots. Trees seeded during the early terraforming process produced softer wood than is traditionally used to create stringed instruments. This limitation ultimately gave rise to the Saisei-made softwood guitar, or s-guitar, which produces a mellower, more resonant sound than its Earth-made equivalent. </p><br/><p>Saisei musicians soon began experimenting with natural sounds. By the middle of the 27th century, a typical Saisei arrangement might include several dozen different natural samples, often arrayed so elaborately that their source could not be externally determined. </p><br/><h1>WIDESPREAD POPULARITY</h1><br/><p>For roughly four hundred years, Saisei traditional music was not widespread beyond the Centauri system. That changed in 2932 when Saisei-based band The Claw appeared on Terra, Show Me the Music!, a popular Spectrum-based showcase for aspiring bands. Instead of performing an original song, The Claw chose to perform a Saisei-styled interpretation of Clover's \"Moonlight,\" then at the height of its popularity. The group used a traditional s-guitar and an array of cultivated aquatic insect sounds to give the song what the series' host termed \"eerie, still movement.\" The performance was accompanied by a holographic light show based in traditional Saisei culture. </p><br/><p>In under two weeks, The Claw had the number one single on popular music charts of both Earth and Terra (Terra III). Viewers initially curious about the light show and the unusual sounds became interested in the music itself. The Terra Gazette dubbed this style of music S-pop. A brief S-pop craze followed The Claw's larger UEE debut with music producers rushing to sign hitherto unknown acts from Saisei and other performers around the galaxy eager to emulate what they considered an exciting new discovery. </p><br/><p>S-pop ruled Spectrum from November 2932 to December 2934 with dozens of songs taking top positions. Although interest in S-pop has waxed and waned in the ensuing years, the impact of the fad has had permanence.

What\u2019s that been like?", "answer": "It\u2019s been a lot of fun and a lot of work. It\u2019s pretty amazing, because I never guessed it would\u2019ve turned into what it\u2019s turned into when we started out. I was just hoping there was a big enough group of people out there that still wanted a space game like the kind I made so I could go off and make it. Obviously we\u2019re way beyond that. We\u2019ve been able to build this really large company that\u2019s dedicated to making the best space game possible. We now have over 360 people in four studios spread between L.A., Austin, Manchester and Frankfurt. We also have folks working on it up in Montreal. It\u2019s pretty amazing that from this one idea, this big company has grown and evolved, and of course that comes with its own set of work. There\u2019s a challenge to build and grow a company while trying to build a really ambitious game.<br /><br />And it\u2019s really interesting that we\u2019re doing it in public. All the past games I\u2019ve built have been built behind closed doors, and have been funded by a publisher. You\u2019d go off and work on something for several years before you even show it to people. With Star Citizen, from the very beginning, we were just like, \u201cHey! This is what we\u2019re doing!\u201d That is exhilarating, and it\u2019s great to get feedback and all that stuff, but of course that can have unfavorable consequences. But I\u2019d rather take the good with the bad.<br /><br />The biggest takeaway for me is the community. In the past, all the games I\u2019ve made \u2014 I knew that people liked them, they got all these reviews \u2014 but you never really connected to the people that liked the game or what you were doing. That\u2019s not what happens with a crowdfunded game. We have this huge, supportive community, and over the last four years they\u2019ve supported us to a level no other crowdfunding game has seen before. They make this game possible. It\u2019s amazing to see their excitement and enthusiasm.<br /><br />You have this direct connection to the players, and there\u2019s something really cool about that \u2014 not just for me, but for a lot of the people working on this stuff. When they build a cool ship or they build a cool feature, all these people say, \u201cAhh, I really like that, it\u2019s really cool!\u201d A lot of times when you\u2019re creating something, you\u2019re doing it for yourself, but you also want to do it so other people enjoy it. If you\u2019re working on a triple-A game, you could be locked up for four years before knowing whether anyone likes it or not or is even excited about it.

So the harvesters are harvesting resources from the worlds they're sort of conquering or destroying and that's sort of turned into the you know, utilized by the Vanduul warmachine to make their fleet bigger and make their fleet stronger. So we definitely will probably have them appearing and obviously Vanduul appearing in the bigger Star Citizen when we get to the worlds that Vanduul are kind of... or the systems that the Vanduul are present in or are threatening.So planetary landing and procedural planets are a big part of the game and they actually will also be apart of Squadron 42. We're planning and utilizing the technology, not just in Star Citizen, but in Squadron 42 for some of the locations you'll visit just because the idea of sort of seamless flying around from you know, you can see off in the distance a little dot and then you fly up to it and it turns into a moon and you fly down onto it and go right down to a gas refining facility and then fight pirates there or whatever you'll be doing.It's amazing to just have sense of scale of scope and it's all there and there's no tricks where there's a loading screen or there's suddenly clouds in your way and then we've streamed in a level, it's all there in one coherent world, all in the same 64-bit vector space and you know, the planets or the planetoids cause you know obviously we also use for moons or whatever, they you know, [Creates a ball with his hand and moves his hand around it] I can see it here, I can land here and gravity works all around it and you can literally walk all the around the planet or fly all the way around it.So we build ground vehicles or we just announced this Dragonfly sale which is also sort of a space bike, but a ground bike and it's good for zipping around there and it's going to be super cool. So we're going to be using that for everything, including Squadron 42 and in the PU I would say that the big difference between what I was thinking that we were going to do a few years ago and what we can do now is there's going to be so much more gameplay and content in individual systems because we can literally have every moon and every planet be something you can: fly, land on, walk around, move around, mine things on, search for things, rescue people on, get jumped by pirates on. So there's not just for potential for missions spawning in space, there's potentially for all sorts of missions to spawn on down planets just like they'll be missions that could spawn on space stations or missions spawning on space wrecks hanging out in asteroid fields. So the amount of gameplay that's opened up in the same area you'll have, it's exponentially more gameplay and it's really, really, really cool.And the Vanduul harvesters just could be apart of that.", "published_at": "2016-06-20", "title": "Star Citizen: 10 for the Chairman - Episode 85", "source": "https://youtu.be/9IubH4hHIFw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Vacation", "published_at_timestamp": 1466460877}, {"objectID": "373675910", "answer": "Will Weissbaum: So to start off, I think the inspiration comes from a lot of places. A lot of times you'll just be driving home and an idea will pop in your head and you'll come in really jazzed and it will really flow from you. But a lot of times having a creative job, it's the job portion of it where you have to have the discipline to come in and write and generate ideas on demand, and that's the difficult part.We all have an office together and it's really helpful to be able to turn around and toss out ideas. So sometimes we'll sit around and do brain storm sessions where we use shared documents to share ideas with each other and that's a life saver! I don't know how it is as an artist having that forced creativity come about.Jeremiah Lee: Yeah, it's pretty similar but the difference would be the writers would come up with a backbone for the visuals, for the concepts. But we have to flesh those concepts out and sometimes the definitions of a character or an idea are very broad so we'd have to fill those in and that's where the creativity comes in. Which is very close too, since we work with other artists, we bounce back ideas. Sometimes, like for the John Rhys-Davies character, you and I, we chatted quite a lot actually just regarding the outfit.WW: Yeah, it was pretty fun coming at it from his background and how that translated into the materials or the designs.JL: Right, right. So art is pretty much similar. I mean sometimes we do have \"artist's block\" and we're like \"oh no what do we do, it's due in two hours but we don't know ... !\"WW: So how do you get past your \"artist's block\"?JL: For me it's research.WW: Okay.JL: There's a plethora of information out there and so, if I'm designing a leather jacket, I don't just type in \"leather jacket\" on Google. I might ...WW: You should! That would probably be a good place to start! [laughs]JL: Yeah that would be. But if I want something original I'd search for things that might be related, so I might do like \"motorcycle outfit\" or like, I don't know, \"World War II\" and maybe if  I see some cool shapes I might implement it into a leather jacket or something. So that's my way of getting round the \"artist's block\".WW: Yeah, research can be very helpful to take a break and do it online. I find myself getting caught in \"research loops\" though because I love learning.JL: Yes!WW: So I'll start looking up stuff and ten minutes later you are somewhere completely different on Wikipedia and you're like \"okay, I got to actually go back\". And then, probably the biggest thing I would say, that took me a while to learn, is even when you don't feel inspired or you feel like you don't have a good idea is just to put out whatever you do have in your head and oftentimes just dumping out that first pass will let you be like \"well that's stupid but this would be cool\" and then you can revise from that. But staring at blank sheet, or blank canvas, is the really daunting part.JL: Oh, gosh yeah!WW: So if you can just start filling that in with whatever then that a huge grab.[referring back to the question] And so stories about the relationship between the races? Yeah, hopefully. We have a lot of discussions going on behind the scenes about the races and how the different alien species are going to interact with each other. And so we're planning on how we are going to roll out that content. And we are still working with various different authors to generate material for the Jump Points mainly right now.

I logged in when this was happening.MS: So just for a little bit of context the incident in question is what was described. So a virus got unleashed into a massive populous.DH: It was a bug. There was a DOT.MS: Yes, there was a debuff effect that was causing this virus and it wasn't intended that it was going to wipe out the world but it did.DH: Yeah the timer wouldn't end. And it was contagious.MS: Yeah, very contagious. So the high-level idea of this, where you do have this uncontrollable viral outbreak is an insanely cool high-level thing, but something to consider with it is just how destructive that is. In this example it even as it says here players-forced euthanasia or government-forced euthanasia. That was how that situation had to be contained. Entire player, well not player cities, but like main hubs ...DH: Ogrimmar.MS: ... in the game had to be just wiped out, every living thing had to die! So to do that for the PU, having some sort of a viral incident: definitely want to explore that. Having it be something that could contaminate and infect the entire universe is a little less likely.DH: And that's a huge content shift.MS: Because that would effectively be like \"cool, let's just eradicate Terra and everyone who lives on there\". And it's not really the friendliest option.DH: And also that becomes the story. You can't do \"I'm going to pick up three tonnes of iron ore and move it to Stanton because, oh my god, there's a pandemic making people bleed on me\". It feels like everything else grinds to a halt. That was a thing like I mentioned: I logged in randomly while that event was going on and I spawned in Ogrimmar and there were just corpses everywhere, and I had no idea what was going on so I just took off because I saw bleeding people and just started running. So it's a great narrative hook, no doubt, but it would be dangerous.MS: The dangers of it are definitely there. Although even on a smaller scale like having a ship-wide event, that's probably something you could see. So you're doing some research on your Endeavour or other science type ship, and something goes wrong there, that could definitely be more of a case where it's that same kind of fear and same kind of panic but in a much more controllable scale where billions of entities won't have to die just to get things back to normal.DH: There could even be a planet that needs to be quarantined because they have a thing but then again it feels like it's a very guarded type thing where it's like \"oh well they need more resources to maintain this quarantine\" then maybe you can have the narrative hook of \"oh the quarantine starts to fail\". But again that feels more kind of a scripted thing rather than just creating a virus bug and just letting it go and run rampant.MS: So it's definitely something that we want to explore but it is making sure that we can explore it without being too punishing to everyone else who may not find viral outbreaks the most valuable use of their gaming hours.", "published_at": "2015-12-28", "published_at_timestamp": 1451344698, "question": "Has the idea of terminal illness or genuine disease been discussed?

I'm curious if this simple add-in by developers would cause the entire verse to go nuts, both 'government' and player-forced euthanasia, extreme traffic control/blockades....that sort of thing. The point is that player psychology would be studied for decades by IRL teachers/students doing term papers...etc about how in-game players react to a pandemic, was there blood/did they handle it well, how different was it to a real scenario? So devs don't even need to set up the government, let the players do the work and I bet dollars to donuts the publicity would go through the roof.

And then, potentially, if you're talking between someone on that frequency, depending on the ship and equipment, someone else could potentially snoop on it depending on what they've got. Not all the time but some people would. So we'll allow you to hail ships and open secure transmissions with them or just generally broadcast stuff and go from there.

Or will the existing two be expanded?", "answer": "First of all, I think we're starting to, well not really starting to, we've decided it's not really Arena Commander that we're dropping, we're dropping multi-crew which is really, we've been calling it SC Alpha for awhile, but SC Alpha as we drop with the multicrew will have Arena Commander inside of it, it will have Star Marine inside it, it will have the social Planetside inside it.  Plus, you'll be playing on a brand new map, so I think I've talked about this before.  It's a large world map, it's much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, MUCH, MUCH BIGGER than the Arena Commander maps, which are limited to I think about 8 to 10 km in diameter.  For this map, it's hundreds of thousands or millions of kilometers in size, so it's geometrically larger by a long way.  It's setup to be more like the persistent universe, it's not meant to be a simulation the way Arena Commander itself is, which is a bit more gamey.  You are going to spawn on a space station the way you saw at the Gamescom demo.  You'll be able to go to different panels and say \"Oh, I want to pull up this ship from my account\", and say you own a Constellation, so it will say \"Yup, Constellation is on Landing Pad 3\", and then you can go over to Landing Pad 3.  It'll be keyed only for you use and once you've used it, your other friends can come and join you and you can take off from Landing Pad 3.  We'll have a safe zone surrounding the starting space station, and it will be a station similar to what you saw at Gamescom, but with more stuff and more additions and then there will be other areas you can go and explore.  So you could go and explore other space stations, other moons, asteroid fields, communication satellites that you'll be able to hack into and get information, and destinations you'll be able to go and fly.  There will be areas you can go and salvage stuff, reclaim stuff.  There's some asteroids, some space stations, there's some stuff where you'll be able to go and have PVP fights inside as well as on ships, there will be weapons you'll be able to salvage and scavenge, it's going to be kinda fun.  It's going to be kind of a mini little game, much more free form and allow more things for players to do.  So yeah, it's a pretty big map, and it's got a lot more than any of our other stuff has, and there'll be a fair amount of stuff for people to do.  We're interested in seeing what happens.  There will be random AI encounters you can go and find, sort of have a more single player experience, but there'll be other areas where it'll be okay to fight other players and then you can have at it.  Yeah, it's going to be a fun, free form experience and like I said, it's our version of the test kitchen of the Persistent Universe, where we'll start to roll out new functionality and new testing.  We get minable asteroids happening with the voxel tech we want to work on, put asteroids out there you can go mine, you can have that happening.  You want to have a cargo mission where you go from A to B, those kinds of things would start to happen and spawn on here.  That's what we're calling our large world map, Crusader, is the name of the map, and it's based around the gas giant of Crusader.  Instead of adding new maps, we'll probably just keep adding points of interest because we're on a large world map so the thing is massive.  It could be a couple billion kilometers across, so we'll be able to keep on adding points of interest.  There will be places where you can repair your ship, there will be places where you can refuel.  So yeah, a big difference between Arena Commander and what we are calling SC Alpha.  Obviously then, we start expanding on that, because then at some point we'll let you go down and land on a planet, and then you'll be on the Planetside location as you've been seeing in ArcCorp.  You can also buy and sell stuff, and then take off and go to other places.  That's basically the Star Citizen game cycle, and then we keep adding more functionality, more locations, open up more jump points and then go on from there.  It's going to be cool, and we'll be giving you the first drop of SC Alpha/multicrew ready for you after Citizen Con, so end of October.  We're feeling pretty optimistic about being able to do that, but you know, that's still a little ways off, so don't shoot me if something blows up and goes wrong.  So far, in what we've got left to do, in terms of scoping it we think we should be on that target, but you're getting it raw from the source, there's no padding in that.  But definitely, you'll be playing it not far after that, and having a good time.  We're excited about it, we're kind of keen to see how people feel about it, because there will be lots of more stuff to do and I'm sure there will be loads of cool videos you guys will be making and we've got a big plan to deliver a lot of content, carrying out from then onwards.", "published_at": "2015-09-14", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 66", "source": "https://youtu.be/VGTj2iWkS-8", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Nick", "published_at_timestamp": 1442269621}, {"objectID": "373681490", "question": "Now that one of the major directors left for Blizzard, that left us thinking that he didn't have confidence in the project.

We've had people leave for personal reasons, we've had people leave to pursue dreams jobs they've had since they were children. You can have passion and confidence in more than one project at the same time and just because you can only have one job doesn't mean that...DV: On top of that, mobility between companies is a very normal thing especially during the lifespan of a game cycle. At any video game company you're going to see people come and go, it's a very mobile industry that you see a lot of hiring and you see a lot of leaving. So, one person leaving doesn't necessarily mean a nail in the coffin for a project or that the project is now diminished. So, we've hired actually quite a few people within the last year and all these people are equally as passionate as the others. So, you're not going to see a diminishment in the quality of the game, you're not going to see less passion because like I said everyone of us is absolutely passionate for it.LO: The producers who have left recently, just to add, have all been here at least a year or many years, since the beginning of the project. Frankly, I would be worried if you saw a bunch of producers come on, stay three months and leave. That might be a sign of....DV: I think it's a sign of lack of commitment.  LO: Yeah, lack of commitment but that's not what you're seeing here at all.DV: Everybody here is die hard and passionate for the project. We're here for the long haul. Some people like Lisa said have to leave for personal reasons, some people have to leave for professional reasons, some people may be offered their dream job out of state or out of country. It doesn't mean they're disappointed in the project, it doesn't mean they have less confidence in the project. They have their own reasons. So, ultimately we support people if they want to pursue things outside of the company, we're sad to see them go and thankful for the contribution they've made...LO: We still have great relationships with all of them.DV: Absolutely. I still talk with a lot of old friends who used to be here. So, if you or you know someone who has the skills and passion to help bring this project to reality, closer towards the vision that Chris wants. Please do check out the website, see what opportunities are available.

It'd actually be kind of cool to have a situation where you monitor a team almost like Aliens, that's something we should consider doing because that'd be a really cool role. We were thinking when you land a dropship either the pilot would take off again and go back out, or potentially get out of the ship and join the rest of the team on the assault.

With 10 missions of 30 minutes the first episode would already be as long as some other single-player games.", "answer": "Yes it's going to be quite long. I think Erin and the SQ42 team are estimating that the playtime for SQ42 with 50 missions will be around 50 hours, and that's because the missions themselves will probably take at least 30 minutes, and also between missions you move around the various ships and places you'll be, talking to people, having a sit down, engaging with characters etc, that'll add time to it. The missions are quite involved by the way, they're not just like \"follow a patrol route\", that might be a part of it, but in many cases there's stuff on the ground etc too. The first 10 missions could arguably be equivalent to 20 plus missions in an old school wing commander game. The team at foundry 42 are keen to knock it out of the park, and what they're working on and what they've planned definitely would go head to head with any AAA game on it's own. Period. And that's just one aspect of what we're doing.

The UEE doesn't want you selling weapons to the Vanduul, but potentially, you know, someone wants to make a fast buck doing that and deal with the risks. So those are the kind of things we'll do. I'm not sure right now we're gonna have sort of nice, peaceful, pacifist Vanduul, because they're sort of our big Bogeyman in the universe.

It's sort of like tagging someone as a temporary friend. Not that they're necessarily a friend, but it allows you to follow their movements or meet them out in space or track them, which is necessary if you're meant to track someone down for a bounty or whatever.That's kind of how the person of interest system is designed to work, so we'll see how it works in reality, but I'm hoping it will work well, because it will put you together with either your friends or people you're interested in, or people that would be related to what your group is doing, your enemies and stuff.", "published_at": "2014-04-14", "title": "10 for the Chairman - Episode 16 .

A Class-5 turret and above are manned turrets, so on a Constellation is two Class-5 turrets, on the back of a Freelancer there's a Class-5 turret. A Class-4 turret is essentially a weapon mount that has either a bigger gun or hardpoints for two smaller guns. So a good example is the Hornet, the ball turret it a Class-4, and also the canard turret is a Class-4. A Class-2 mount is essentially a very small turret that can only fit one smaller gun on. So an example of a Class-2 mount is the wing gatlings on the Hornet for instance. A Class-1 is a fixed mount for a gun. So I hope that explains it to a certain extent. We have actually a bigger setting that goes all the way up to Class-10 for including capital ship mounts.
