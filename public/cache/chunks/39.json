I mean, you know what's the difference if you're not, besides walking over to the person, what's the difference between being on one side of the building compared to the other side of the building or being on side of the building to another building in another country. There really is no difference to some degree other than the walking over and talking to them.CH: To some degree. Although I would love to ...FS: Besides the time difference.CH: I would love to, to walk over to someone in the U.K. office and just shake the back of the chair and say, \"Hey! Look at me!\"FS: Yes, yes.CH: That's, that's what I really want. I just want to be obnoxious. It's good times.

I don't know if it's more versatile cause to be honest with you the Idris, for the money it packs a punch. It's a mini carrier plus it can go toe to toe with other capital ships, like has massive living quarters and everything like that. We're sorta planning that the proper Corvette we do will be about 100 meters or so and it'll be more focused on... let's put it this way, it's not going to be a massive carrier. Obviously you'll be able to dock a ship and do all the rest of the stuff and certainly can hold it's own fighting some fighters and bigger ships and quite a few of them would cause of problem for a bigger ship like a frigate or a destroyer and all that stuff.It should also be easier to control and command cause the Idris is just huge, I mean I think you've seen some of the stuff we've shown for it and it's just massive. It's probably not going to be a viable ship for one person to or even one person and a few of his friends to sort of command. The Idris is going to require quite a few players to man it in unison, which I think will be really satisfying once all that happens and definitely some NPCs helping you out.

So lately it's been coming off of the big shoot at Imaginarium which was awesome we've been spreading out and focusing on some of the other stuff and a lot of the more PU stuff that's coming up so we've been doing a lot of work on the exoverse baby PU minverse whatever. The 1.3 that's coming out so we've been trying to work out some of that we've been trying build in more narrative stuff for ArcCorp trying to tie in more dialogue going on in the background and starting to think about the narrative system going to work into there with the gradual releases Tony and his team are working on. There's been a lot of little stuff and we've also been doing a lot of work and helping the starmap come alongAdam Wieser: That's been one of my main focuses lately, obviously besides the weekly dispatches, the jumpoints preparing content for that. I know Dave is working on so much stuff right now it makes my head spin. He's currently in London he's back over there taking care of some stuff and going to be at Citizencon/ We're all working and working very hard there's lots of balls in the air and it's actually exciting and fun to do as a writer because it means you can sit there and focus on something for a few hours shift gears and move on to something else it's a good way to stay fresh creativelyWW: When we were focusing on Squadron 42 it was like this one big massive fire that we  had to put out but now that everyone across all our studios is coming online to full strength things are really happening quickly so now these days it's more about addressing all these little small fires that are bursting out and running around so that's really exciting in its own kind of way", "title": "10 for the Writers: Episode 05", "source": "https://youtu.be/u9ZZjMivl84", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "RufusUltra", "published_at_timestamp": 1444081873}, {"objectID": "373681630", "question": "Could you rank the following possible influential/inspirational materials in order of personal importance when you start a new concept ship: ship role, company style guide, reference pictures, what you think fits the 'Verse, personal appeal, favourite sci-fi or other fictional sources?", "answer": "Omar Aweidah: You wanna take that first?Forrest Stephan: Sure. Yeah. So, we do actually spend quite a bit of time, I mean, again, it all comes back to the manufacturers right? They kinda define the way everything looks now. But one thing, lately we've been looking at the shapes of the ships and making sure that the form fits with each manufacturer, having similar styles as far as maybe the bridge is always rounder on this type of ship, but it's much more blocky or square on on this manufacturer, you know?So, maybe this is more of a fighter pilot, this is more kind of industrial.  So we do definitely keep a very big log of exactly kind of our style guides of how we approach each and every ship, and it kind of already falls into a type and a visual feel right off the bat when we start doing the concept.OA: Yeah, and sometimes certain ships, we haven't done a lot of them, they haven't been developed as fully as ones we've done a lot, but we're always consistently growing, and we try to keep the same essence and form language, more now than ever before. Cause you know, obviously the beginning of the ships, it was kind of like...FS: We were still figuring it out.OA: Still figuring it out. But now I think what's going to happen is the bar's going to be risen. But, for personal influences and how you start, I guess... how I start a concept, sometimes you just look at a couple of pictures, and go, 'oh, I kind of like this and this shape,' but it's different every time. If I'm really in the dark, I'll just block out shapes until I see something, just black and white, just nothing...FS: Just the silhouette.OA: Yeah, sometimes not even. There's this program called Alchemy that just draws weird stuff, sometimes it's just, 'ah, I see something in there'. Other times, you'll get direction from somebody being, 'oh, it's this kind of feel,' and then you start from there and do a little research, and then other times there's no direction at all, and you've got to kinda piece it together yourself. I find just looking at three images... like if I have to do a helmet I'll look at three things that aren't helmets, then a couple of things that are helmets, and kind of mush them together.FS: Yeah, that's great advice too. I mean, I love doing that, you kind of get the overall look that I want to go for, and I find a couple of examples, then I find some kind of more radical looking things that aren't necessarily on those things and I figure out this kind of style, this kind of look, that kind of fits the way it should be, but it's not part of it, and I'll just start of combining things, and start building shapes, and try to get something original and new so it's not completely just reiterating on something that already exists. Evolve the art and the process and keep trying new things, and you'll kind of see it and think that works, or you'll know no, it doesn't.OA: Yeah, and it's always kind of different every time you start. I don't know if someone has a specific method of how they begin something each and every time. Cause lots of time you have to start just from a blank piece of paper, which is pretty tough you know?FS: Yeah it is.OA: Or a blank idea. You come up to me and are like 'I need a jetpack' and I'm like 'I don't knooooow', and it's like okay.FS: I did that for Gamescom. Asked him to do a jetpack in one day.", "title": "10 for the Artists: Episode 04", "source": "https://youtu.be/PGF2ili56Js", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Far-seeker", "published_at_timestamp": 1439243857}, {"objectID": "373682440", "question": "I'm wondering if there will be customizable character helmets or body armor in the PU? Would it be possible, perhaps in the near future, that we could buy 'alien' looking or perhaps some 'mecha' looking armor, helmets etc... perhaps each part with their own perks and / or disadvantages?", "answer": "Forrest Stephan: So. Let me tell you. Boy, is there customization in the PU, because we have spent the last 3 months concentrating on making sure that the characters have a good amount of customization for the PU. And you will absolutely be able to change your helmet, get new helmets, and I don't know what the limitations are on alien races and stuff, but I think it's pretty safe to say that that's going to be a big aspect of the game.Omar Aweidah: Yeah, and it's a really large task too. Like, the concept itself is pretty simple, being able to swap in my helmet and stuff, but it's remarkably difficultFS: to make everything work, to swap out different areas of the character, to make it always not look weird is the hardest thing.OA: Cause you give someone full customization, man, I'm going to turn this shirt to bright pink, make my plants bright blue, but there's a lot of...FS: What's wrong with pink? My socks are pink.OA: Nothing's wrong with pink, you can have a design to be pink, but then we have to come up with a bunch of limitations too, what you can and cannot... tech limitations, because there's always a constant give and take. Because if you want this thing, then you get less character on screen, and you want more of this and then you have to take away from certain areas, so what you try to do is you try to find out what's the best balance of, I want to give you everything you want, but you're going to have to lose a little bit of something in some area, because there's only so much memory out there.  And I know optimization...FS: That's the most difficult thing, is the memory. Obviously the more objects you have that get loaded up into the game takes a certain amount of memory, the amount of textures that are required to take that into the game requires a certain amount of memory, but, we've definitely spent a lot of attention to that, and we want to have the biggest PU character experience that you could possibly have with this game, cause like everything else we try to make everything as good as technically possible with the day and age that we're in. So we do a lot of tricks. We're starting to pool, what we call pooling, our materials and textures so, we get everything in a library, and then everything is pooling from these libraries, that way we can have hundreds and hundreds of objects instead of being restricted to dozens or only a hundred. So the game can exponentially grow in size over the months and the years, and we should be able to still support it and it should still run.OA: Yeah, we're developing the tech, too.FS: Right now. Literally right now we have a programmer upstairs (Hi Oka) that's helping us write the stuff, and then also we have a great graphics director, Ali Brown, who also has considerably helped us getting this system in place. Does all the hard parts.OA: And we're learning it too, so as time goes on in the next few years, we're going to get better at understanding it, at utilizing it, and at optimizing it, ourselves as artists, just because we're learning a new tool essentially, so what's the best way to use this tool. It's something that'll just grow over time.FS: Absolutely, and it's headed in the right direction so... I'm excited.OA: I think that when it's released there'll be a decent amount of customization, and then obviously through, as the game evolves, it'll really start to, the Universe will end up populating itself.FS: And we put a lot of effort to making sure that our objects are almost dynamic in a way, so as we make better textures, as we make better materials , the objects aren't kind of just baked and static, they also get better over time. So, we don't plan on the game just, you know, throwing it away in a year. We want to evolve and continue for years to come, so it was very important that the art evolved with the game, and the time, that way when new games come out we still are competitive with the same asset that we made today.OA: That's a really good point, how we can always change things, because of the system we're developing. We can always grow.FS: Do you get an alien hat? I don't know. I'll make you one if you don't... We'll make you an alien hat. Or alien head, like a mask. Are there halloween parties in the 'Verse? What if you were to... how cool would that be, you put on like a Vanduul costume.OA: DudeFS: Then you have those little things you put on, the overalls.OA: I want one at Christmas parties.FS: What Christmas party?OA: Halloween parties, Christmas party...FS: Bad Christmas sweatshirtsOA: All of a sudden the Universe is snowing in the vacuum of space.
