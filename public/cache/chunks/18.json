We kind of abused the system a little bit to get the results we want on ArcCorp, to say the least. It probably will be a similar story. We're not planning on spending a year making bespoke ArcCorp tech. But there is parts of the new system that we're hoping will allow improvements on ArcCorp. Obviously, things about the amount of light that will gather underneath a tree and whether a fern can grow isn't really relevant. But there are many other parts that are relevant with the density, with the way we position things. We have a grid pattern for where we're going to put things, but then we randomize it. We could kind of just remove that randomization and get an actual grid pattern more naturally. And yeah, a lot of these rule sets, they're built for nature. But some of them, again, they're more powerful this time. So we might be able to abuse them again to get something nice out of ArcCorp. But we're not focusing on that at the moment. We're making sure that we can deliver every other planet. And we're hopeful that we will then be able to do something nice with ArcCorp at the end as a result. Because all planets must eventually use this tech. There is no option long term. They all must use it. It's just a question of how much we have to change to make it suitable for ArcCorp at the end.

Like I think at this point, people have enjoyed the pomp and circumstance of getting these ships. It's a really cool thing when you do it. But of course, with anything, you do it enough times and you kinda just wanna get your ship, right? So we're looking at potentially some ways where you know you're getting, let's say like a Titan or something like out of an XL hangar. It feels kind of absurd, like the giant experience that unfolds for you over the period of time it takes. So we're looking at, for example, maybe we can like preset the loading platform height or maybe adjust some timings to make it faster. So you don't have to wait quite as long, but without changing some of the fundamental elements of that experience. We still want it to feel big and important and have that pomp and circumstance, have it feel somewhat epic.

Some bugs haven't been fixed for over a year.", "answer": "Todd thinks that it depends on the bug. He uses the HUD bug as an example, where you look at certain bright backgrounds and then can't see your HUD, saying that it's something that just hadn't been prioritised because they know that they're re-doing the HUD and adjusting it. They've had initial talks regarding how to fix it, and for Todd it's a Quality of Life experience that will need to get fixed, ideally sooner rather than later. However, with Staggered Development, if they're building features that are intended to release within a certain time-frame, and their time building the features is half of that time, then that leaves less time to fix things, whereas if they spend three quarters of that time they have instead of half, then they have more time with which to fix the bugs and work on the Quality of Life. As such, Erin, Todd, and QA go through and look at the bugs, and pick out bugs that need to be prioritised (and this can involve working with PR too) which are typically related to the gameplay experience aspect, regardless of whether the bug in question is trivial, minor, or moderate bug, instead of only focusing on critical bugs and blockers. So this means that they've changed their pipeline to get these bugs fixed throughout the quarter as well, so Players will start seeing Quality of Life issues being slowly resolved. Brian adds that they're moving forward so fast and focused on the future that it's really important for them to stop and recognise that there are some bugs that have been there for a while that need to be dealt with. Todd continues by saying that with the Quality of Life stuff, when they take those bugs into account they know roughly when working on something that will cover the bug, such as with their UI reworks, so if they have an MFD bug but the ship UI is being reworked, they'll assess whether it's going to be fixed based off of that work, or whether they can live with it for a little while. Simply put, they don't want to waste time by fixing a bug that's going to be dealt with anyway by something like a rework, and therefore they want to be as efficient as possible. Typically they'll look at a bug and judge whether it's going to get resolved in the next 6 weeks or in the next 3 months, and if so then they won't fix it, otherwise they will, and that's a juggling act they go through every quarter. Jared says that that's a big part of why the new Staggered Development initiative is taking place, which is a desire to have more time to spend addressing bugs and Quality of Life issues, so if things go as they hope they will, it should lead to an overall improved experience with many long-standing bugs being addressed.

Their UI tech now allows for not having the IT text appear, which is particularly useful for things like elevators where the required information can be on or next to the buttons, without needing to use Inner Thought.

So we want to make even the base has a really weak EVA but it has some.<br /><br />So that you can\u2019t put yourself in the situation where you bail out of a ship and can\u2019t go anywhere, as it\u2019s just a game breaker. It is a super weak EVA you\u2019re not going to use it constantly and is you put a jet pack or augment EVA it\u2019ll be a lot faster. So it is up to the player how strong the EVA is. That is something we haven\u2019t spoken about before so that\u2019s something very unique and exclusive!", "title": "Exclusive Star Citizen Interview With Sean Tracy & Eric Kieron Davis", "source": "https://youtu.be/xGV2996y4Jk", "time": "20m51s", "type": "youtube", "user": "Gabriel Rej", "transcript": "http://www.justpushstart.com/2017/03/exclusive-star-citizen-interview-sean-tracy-eric-kieron-davis-full-transcript/4/", "published_at_timestamp": 1490484602}, {"objectID": "15297a55aad75d_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "One of the great advantages of the Hornet series is that it was designed for a certain level of versatility: solid, well rounded performance that lays the foundation for a variety of gameplay styles. In many respects it's also one of the most versatile fighters, as evidenced by its variants.

If you're flying a Hurricane solo, the natural tendency is to fight while focused mainly forward; even with a look-aim capability, you're going to be largely focusing your firepower within a fighter's traditional business end.  This is formidable firepower, but the Hurricane still shines best with a dual crew: the pilot can handle the demanding maneuvers and situational awareness required for survival and can also keep an eye towards the resource management that is so critical to this ship (see also below, re: power management) while the gunner makes sure the enemy always has plenty to think about. Meanwhile, the gunner gets some simple access to multi-crew features, helping out with radar and missile locks. Have a plan going in, work as a team, and the two crew become a force of nature.

If everyone sort of says okay we\u2019re going to play from 6pm till 9pm, and then they all log out at 9pm, then we\u2019ll probably save off the state of the ship, you know after, there\u2019s a little bit of time and then bam, if you\u2019re safe, it\u2019s okay it\u2019ll get saved and we\u2019ll just respawn when you log back on. If something happens when like you\u2019ve disconnected or you\u2019ve logged out, or, we mention that, and the ship does get destroyed, then you would essentially, it would, it would respawn you at the closest sort of respawn point that we\u2019ve sort of, you know, it\u2019s the kind of like Death of a Spaceman mechanic, where you come back, you wake up in the medbay, and your body\u2019s been recovered from space, and then you\u2019d probably have to have an insurance claim, so your your key is, if you\u2019re going to logout, you should make sure that you\u2019re sort of logging out when you\u2019re not near any hostiles or enemies, because there will be a period, if there are hostiles or enemies, your ship will still persist and will persist there until the hostiles, enemies, are either gone, or your ship is, you know,<br /><br />TP: Blown up<br /><br />CR: Been destroyed.<br /><br />TZ: Well we\u2019re, we\u2019re trying to split that fine line between giving you the convenience to actually be 20 minutes out from some major city in an asteroid field doing something and you log off, you can continue back the next day, but at the same time we need to prevent players from exploiting this functionality such that they\u2019re in the middle of you know combat and basically just logging out and their ship goes immediately.<br /><br />CR: Yeah yeah, we don\u2019t want, I mean like, there\u2019s got to be some, there has to be persistence, there has to be consequence, or else you, everything you earn will mean nothing, so, there needs to be some like, \u2018I need to get to an area where I\u2019m safe and then I can log out\u2019. That\u2019s what we want, we don\u2019t want you going, we don\u2019t want people rage, pulling the internet cord, in the middle of a battle they know they\u2019re losing just to essentially escape losing their ship, cause that wouldn\u2019t be cool at all, so when you get into a situation, whether it\u2019s AI or another player, fighting with, you\u2019re at risk to lose your ship there, and yes, it would suck if you got disconnected at that very moment in time, on the internet by no fault of your own, but I mean we can\u2019t really, we can\u2019t tell when someone rage disconnects or someone gets their internet service drops on them, so we\u2019ll just persist the ship, and hopefully they can reconnect back in and get back into it. And if you\u2019re flying a bigger ship like a multicrew ship, those are going to be tougher, probably more, tougher than we even have right now\u2026<br /><br />TZ: They wouldn\u2019t, but your NPC crew on those larger ships, you\u2019re probably going to have a healthy contingent of other players helping you, or other NPC\u2019s, and those people would continue..<br /><br />CR: Would still be active so yeah, to be clear, if you disconnected and you have an NPC crew, that ship would still exist, the NPC crew doing stuff, and then if you reconnect and you\u2019re back in there on the ship, and we\u2019ll keep it in that state for a while to allow you to reconnect, so the key is really just to make sure that, if you\u2019re travelling, and you want to save, you\u2019ve just got to make sure you\u2019re saving in an area where it\u2019s fairly safe, you\u2019re not going to be under threat of attack.<br /><br />ER: So I know, there\u2019s absolutely mute questions that come from this conversation, I know we\u2019ve talked about it, so, I just want to bring it up, is the question of you know, you\u2019ve got your crew of hopefully friends and you disconnect, and now your friends are running your ship. What\u2019s to stop them from, you know, I mean, basically there probably isn\u2019t anything but the question that\u2019s been talked about is what happens then, as long as they decide to take your ship somewhere else without your permission\u2026<br /><br />CR: Well, what can\u2026 I mean at that point, I lend you my car and then\u2026<br /><br />ER: No no, I agree, just the point\u2026<br /><br />CR: You decide to take it on a rally and<br /><br />ER: Right, so basically<br /><br />TZ: I see this as being more like, this is the exact same that we\u2019re going to encounter over and over again that we\u2019ve talked about which is, if somebody boards your ship, can they basically just sit in the pilot seat and go, and that\u2019s the way it is right now, but eventually we\u2019re going to have much more of a security system concept, and so irregardless of the fact that I allow other players onto my ships, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that I as captain have basically given them the keys to the thing, so I disappear\u2026<br /><br />CR: You may not give them the permission\u2026<br /><br />TZ: That\u2019s exactly it.<br /><br />CR: To use the helm, they may have the permission to walk all around or use turrets or whatever, but\u2026<br /><br />TZ: So I could see<br /><br />CR: they won\u2019t have the keys to the ignition.<br /><br />TZ: I could see the captain, the owner of the ship, basically designating who can do what, if i\u2019m disconnected then my navigator<br /><br />TP: Or SO yeah<br /><br />TZ: whether it\u2019s a player or NPC can basically assume, you know, control of piloting the craft, but I in advance basic ally said how I want the ship to, how I want the crew to be able to respond in this particular scenario<br /><br />ER: Also the issue where at the end of the day you\u2019re going to have to basically trust the people you put on your ship because you\u2019re going to assign that stuff<br /><br />TP: But even I mean we\u2019ve talked about reputation hits and, I mean, bounties and all sorts of other things that would hopefully help mitigate that issue<br /><br />TZ: Yeah and that\u2019s a huge part when you\u2019re hiring other players and you see, you\u2019re not going to be doing this blindly. We will be tracking a number of different statistics and attributes that will allow you to get some sense of how they\u2019ve been performing in their\u2026<br /><br />ER: Just see it as part of the gameplay and you just need to make sure that before you go and do that with your ship, you say, yeah you guys can fly around while I'm away for a week on holiday, that you have to understand that stuff can happen.<br /><br />CR: Yeah and basically you shouldn\u2019t, yeah you know, your ship or various equipment, it\u2019s your possessions, and your possessions can be destroyed or stolen by other players. There'll be certain things in place to help prevent that, and there\u2019ll be certain things when forced that not happening in law abiding areas, but you\u2019re always going to have some risk of things, you know, being destroyed or stolen by other players, and there will be a black market so for instance, a ship\u2019s a good example of, you kinda need to transfer title to sell it pretty much anywhere, but if I steal say your constellation, so I probably couldn\u2019t go to ArcCorp and sell it cause I don\u2019t have the papers for it, even if I just took it over, you know i found it sitting there in an asteroid field, no-one was in it, but there\u2019s probably someplace I could go that I could talk to a kind of chop-shop, shady person, who\u2019ll pay me less than you would normally pay for a legitimate second-hand connie, and then I could get some money that way, so we\u2019ll have those sort of systems in, and if you\u2019re flying a ship that is being denoted with the, it\u2019s a stolen ship, and you\u2019re in a law-enforcement area, and the law enforcement scans you or a bounty hunter running around can see that you\u2019re tagged you\u2019re in a stolen ship, then they would have the ability, or the authorization, to engage in, if they\u2019re a player, PVP against you, to sort of bring you to justice, so we\u2019ll sort of have some of that balance, but yeah you should think that your possessions, in general, can be destroyed and can be stolen, that\u2019s one of the reasons why you have insurance, but we want to make it so it encourages you to hold onto your stuff, it encourages you to repair them and maintain, we don\u2019t want you to fly out there, get a scratch on your constellation, and go aww, this is, I don\u2019t like it now, I\u2019m going to smash it into an asteroid field and brow it up and then I\u2019ll respawn and get another constellation instantly, which is what happens right now in the baby PU, in Crusader. So as we move towards a much more persistent, proper game, which 3.0 is really going to be that, we\u2019re going to try to disincentivize you and incentivize you to keep your ship running, keep it maintained, keep it repaired, and try to keep it out of situations where it can be damaged or stolen.<br /><br />TP: Ideally build a relationship with it, but then, I mean I would love to see the awkward conversations that would come out of that like, your brother steals your ship or takes your ship, and then you\u2019re having those conversations of, what did you do with my stuff kind of thing.<br /><br />ER - That never happens.

It\u2019s one of the things we\u2019re looking at heavily right now. We\u2019re looking at having multiple stations including engineering, tactical, we\u2019re looking mainly from the perspective of capital ship, and namely the Idris for us right now, as it\u2019s the main staging platform for SQ42, and we have guys working from the tactical battlesphere to how power gets routed inside the ship and how you can turn certain things on and off. There will be stations with controls where you can see when things overheat, things require more power, things have various problems and they need a maintenance crew being sent there.<br /><br />So there will be these stations where you can command all these things. So we definitely- I mean, the first proper implementation of multi-crew was just the idea of having multiple people on that ship being able to do various things but it was a very early implementation - we definitely aren\u2019t there yet, we\u2019ve never thought that was the end of it, it was just the first step in a multi-crew direction.<br /><br />I mean while they are functioning - you can say \u201cyeah, there are turrets on the ship\u201d, we never liked the idea of being completely \u201cwhen the pilot goes the turret aiming goes completely \u2018woah, I lost track of where everything I was doing because the pilot just took a sharp turn\u2019\u201d. That is something we\u2019ll correct and we\u2019ll try to have that turret have a bit of a smart ring where it tries to, when the ship goes left, the turret still still says in the same rather than following with the ship.<br /><br />--Like modern tanks?--<br /><br />Exactly, modern tanks already do this, they have the turrets completely independant from the tracks - so we will have that just as a matter of time with priorities of what to implement first but that is one of the first things that we will change for the multi-crew ships.<br /><br />Yes, things will evolve from here, this is just the beginning of the multi-crew stuff. Especially- we\u2019re thinking capital ship because once we have that working, we will have a lot of the items we need for the smaller multi-crew ship.

How that exactly works down is way more of a design question, but I know us from a lore perspective are trying to make sure the landing zones are going to be populated with interesting NPC's that have perspectives, that have allegiances.

I know a lot of people have wanted to know more after Chris sent that email out to inform how this was going to work. People like to read what is said and then what's between the lines and there was no real reading between the lines on this one; it was truly just looking at the business, looking at the project and seeing what's best for us to do it as fast, as cheap as we can: which we're always doing! Every day we're doing that! Every hour we're doing that! So you're going to see changes and in normal game development this happens: you go through and you revamp the team.EKD: The previous places I worked we revamped or reorged every year, every six months! It's pretty common because you learn so much more: like I know how to make that ship faster so I don't need so many people, or I need more people, or whatever the case may be. It's just the nature of business.EKD: Have we seen anything? So this is in process of happening right now! We are talking about it because it was just announced and these things just don't happen [snaps fingers] over night! But we are moving quickly on them, so for instance one of the examples is we looked at our amazing audio team, the majority of them if not all of them (except for one) is out in the UK led by Lee Banyard. It's a fantastic team, they deliver quality stuff and they are very quick. The turnaround is very quick and their communication is solid and yadda, yadda, yadda: all the things that make teams great.DV: And their all in one place together.EKD: And their all in one place together. And I think that was one of the things that when you see \"why are they doing so well?\", Well they're all in one place together. They're always together. So when things come up they just turn and they get it fixed so they don't have to wait twenty four hours for an email to come back.

This is a very well timed question, because just last week we noticed - Adam noticed - that there were some published textual inaccuracies concerning a system of planets that contradicted the recorded lore that we have behind the scenes, and we had to engage in a discussion amongst all of us to determine what would be the right one to keep. In this instance, we decided it would be better to keep with the internal lore, because an astrophysicist helped develop this, and so we want things to be just as accurate as they possibly can be for you, and so we went with this choice. And this is the kind of process that we expect to continually engage in in the future, if we spot any more of these innacuracies again. And in my vision, again, I would like for the galactepida to be considered the final word when it's published, and I have a few ideas on how this'll play out. So. Stay tuned for that.Adam Wieser: There's so much lore out there, part of, that's one of the main reasons Cherie's here, and why i'm here, is to scour what we have internally, and what we've published to you backers, so that we understand what we have and where we're going and everything like that, and it's, it's a task, and sometimes things slip through the cracks.

There is no way you're going to engage in attacking other players in PVP, rack up a bounty and get away with it. You've asked for it, other players will come after you! If you're getting a bounty because you're attacking NPC stuff, the slider will have an effect, but really once you have a bounty NPC police and mercenaries will also target you, not just players. That said, even with the bar set really low, if you've got a big enough bounty for NPCs, depending on where you are (you might not be in safe space) other players might be opened up to get you as well. It's sort of more to do with what YOU'RE doing. If you're engaging in acts that would put a bounty on your head in a PVP setting you're sort of \"locking in\" to a PVP response, you can't just hide by changing it later. If you're doing it to NPCs you can keep to more of an NPC response to it.

How do you put yourself in their position and write from their point of view? I imagine it is quite different to how you write for a human character as you have to take an entirely different history and culture of species into account.", "answer": "Dave Haddock: That is a good question.Will Weissbaum: That IS a good question! Uh, give yourself plus one points. Good job.DH: I think at the end of the day, you're still talking about a person. Whether they're Xi'An or human, this is a person who has wants, has needs, has things that they're trying to achieve... things they don't like... stuff like that. I think in any given day, most human beings wouldn't take into account history and culture, but that colors how they interact and how they do stuff, so it's... I don't think it necessarily dictates their behavior, but it just sort of skews how they might react to certain circumstances. But I dunno, I always try to keep the character and what they want as sort of the focus.WW: Who is this specific being? I mean, that can be a thing that you get hung up on, 'cause you think in your head, \"oh, Banu act this way,\" and then you end up writing stereotypes instead of characters.DH: Right!WW: Which, even with our alien races, I think we're trying to avoid that.DH: Yeah, we want them to feel complex, and interesting, and you know, as dynamic, and intelligent, and exciting, and complicated as humanity is - you want to give that sort of aspect to the aliens as well.WW: But trying to reverse the thought, and think about how weird humans might seem, and what are the weird things that humans do, to kind of get that frame of reference. Have you ever been walking along and just look at all the people driving around in cars and wearing clothes, and thinking like if this was animals doing it, it'd be the strangest thing you'd ever seen. So, something like that. Is that weird?

Of course, you couldn't be heading towards him, and say he was \"ramming me\".

Would such a hacker require physical access to your ship's computer? What do you envision the hacking / cyber warfare element of Star Citizen to look like?", "answer": "Great question. Not something that we've done a massive amount of thought on, but it raises a really interesting issue. I mean, we've been thinking primarily for the Drake Herald and the info-runner business about how you would protect data and transmit it, and then also people would wanna block and, you know, try and intercept stuff. So there's a certain amount of sort of electro-computer-hacking-warfare that we were thinking that we would probably do, and we'll probably have some of that on the big ships. I know one of the designs that we've been talking about for the capital ship stuff is you would even have one station where the other person is trying to disrupt the other ships systems and potentially jam them or even try and get a virus aboard them.So there definitely will be some level of that. I don't know so much about hacking personal details and all the rest of the stuff. That would still be a sort of to-be-determined design feature. But we are certainly doing quite a few things that will make the kind of \"hacking warfare\" an aspect that can happen in the game, 'cause it'll definitely be part of some of the big-ship combat, and some of the Squadron 42 stuff, and it'll definitely be part of the info-runner stuff. And so, you know, who knows? Maybe we'll do a little bit of that on the player side, although you wouldn't want to get to the point where someone can get complete identity theft and screwed over in the game, because it's not fun in real life, so we don't really want to do it anyone in the game to a level where it's sort of devastating! Although maybe a small amount of stuff could be interesting, but that's still a to-be-determined aspect.

I would expect that most big ships in space and in our universe would always have some kind of ability to have a complement of fighter craft - even a big battleship. But we definitely have a couple of ships on the drawing board, mainly for Squadron 42, that are just a huge massive battleship that sort of dwarfs the Bengal carrier.

I remember a while back an in game 3D starmap in the works. From the old videos it looked pretty much done. Any word on when we will see that for the community?", "answer": "Good question. The star map, that was sort of an early prototype that we had mocked up inside the engine. It's not something that I'm ready to share yet. First of all we've got a bunch more stuff to do with it in terms of fleshing out all our systems and making sure that we're happy with them, but also just in terms of the interface and how it works so we're actually doing a lot of work right now on what we call our holo-renderer which is the system that's going to be rendering 3d holographic objects as well as data and text on it and that's going to form pretty much all of our systems so that would be the Mobiglas that you have as you run around and you've seen in the fiction. Sort of your first person HUD if you've got a combat suit on. Your ship HUD, which is when you're flying the ship, and we kind of want it all to sort of have this, whether it's an Iron Man feel or a Minority Report feel, or like you've seen in Prometheus with the holo-stuff. But the idea is there's a lot of floating objects that you can manipulate and move around and obviously the holotable, the equipment device in the hangar was very preliminary sort of work and a prototype of using some of this stuff. But we're doing stuff that's well beyond that. There's going to be much cooler which we haven't shown you guys yet and that will also be something that would drive the starmap and the 3d maps and when you're inside your ship and stuff like that. So it will be a while before we show it to you, but when you see it I think you'll be pretty happy, it's pretty cool.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 06 (2014.01.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/NcRxuvQT3Ew", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Christopher Mallec", "published_at_timestamp": 1390598024}, {"objectID": "f8eb78d30ab8e_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "How much does different modules impact the ship weight and how much of a weight difference is there between different modules.
