On 24 June 2610, after a catastrophic defeat in the Centauri System at the hands of Squadron 42, it became clear to Corath\u2019thal and his forces that they could not defeat the UEE military and an armed populace. Faced with the choice between surrender and death at the hands of his enemy, Corath\u2019Ttal chose a third option: he ordered his surviving loyal forces to charge through the UEE military blockade for Elysium.</p><br/><h1>Subject</h1><br/><p>On 25 June 2610, the remains of the Tevarin fleet reached Jalan\u2019s atmosphere. The residents of the planet braced for an attack. Instead, Corath\u2019thal and his fleet dropped their thermal shields and dove for the planet. As they burned in the atmosphere, Corath\u2019thal\u2019s final words were picked up by human communication devices: \u201cWe die at home, and we die free.\u201d</p><br/><h1>Artist</h1><br/><p>Aaron Fring was born on Ferron on 13 October 2578 to teacher Max Fring and pilot Mary Fring. He learned to draw and paint as a child, during a period in which he was bedridden with Kilos\u2019 Malady. As an adult, his illness prevented him from following his mother into service with the UEE Navy, so he joined the UEE Expeditionary Force (UEEEF) as a Field Medic. The UEEEF eventually stationed him on Jalan. He fell in love with the landscape there and was inspired to resume painting. The night of Corath\u2019thal\u2019s descent, Fring was taking an evening walk, having left all his communication devices at his home. As he approached the crest of a hill, he noticed strange lights in the sky, and saw the first of the Tevarin fleet push through the clouds. Fring watched until the last of the ships had either broken apart or crashed. He began work on Tears of Fire the next day.</p><br/><p>The debut of Tears of Fire at the Gemma Gallery of Art launched Fring\u2019s career as a full-time painter. He went on to produce more pieces centered around the Tevarin Wars, to continual acclaim. His portrait of Corath\u2019thal, referenced from holos and oral descriptions, is noted for its use of smoke and lighting. He died on 11 November 2631 from Kilos-related complications, aged 53 years. Tears of Fire was inducted into the UEE Historical Vault for Antiquity in 2633.</p><br/><p>Fring cited human Romantic-era Earth (Sol III) art as one of his primary influences, particularly the use of light and color in Ivan Aivazovsky\u2019s 1848 painting Battle of Chesma.

Star Citizen will go on, that universe will go on as long as anyone is out there wanting to play in it &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; which I'm hoping will be for a long time obviously.  The games I mentioned have been 10 years plus.So, really what we're doing with Star Citizen is we're working on the game, adding features for an incredibly ambitious design &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; I don't think there is any other game that is trying to do as much as we're trying to do.  So, degree of difficulty 11, not 10.  And, we'll have what we determine is a minimum viable product feature list for what you would call Star Citizen the commercial release which is basically when you say, \"Okay, we've gotten to this point and we've still got plans to add a lot more cool stuff and more content and more functionality and more features...\" &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Which by the way includes some of the later stretch goals we have because not all of that is going to be for 'absolutely right here' on the commercial release.  But we'll have something that we'll think, 'Okay yeah, not everyone can play it but it doesn't matter &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; you can load it up, it plays really well, it's really stable, there's lots of content, there's lots of fun things to do, different professions, lots of places to go, we've got a really good ecosystem.'  So, when we get to that point that's when we would say, \"Now it's not alpha, it's not beta, it's Star Citizen 1.0.\"But of course the team is going to absolutely continue working on it, just like if you look at World of Warcraft &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; they continue to add content and features all the time.  The same happens on EVE.  We will update stuff, so we'll update the graphics, we'll add new functionality, new content, new systems, coming across additional alien races &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; all that kind of stuff will be there.  So, we're going to work on this as long as you guys let us or support us doing it, because the world's huge.  There's so many things to do out there.It's the same on Squadron 42.  Once we've told the Squadron 42 trilogy then we're going to move on and we'll have other stories we'll tell.  Maybe they're not necessarily military stories, maybe it's more an adventure &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; sort of a Han Solo style adventure.It's just a huge universe, you know.  Look what Disney's doing with Star Wars.  They've got a whole roadmap of the main ones and the spinoff ones and all the rest of the stuff.So, you know, I think Star Citizen has the possibility to have a huge interesting universe.  We've really put a lot of effort into the lore of it.  I mean, you see from the very beginning that's one of the things that we made foundational.  Dave and his team constantly are fleshing out the world in addition to writing stuff for the Squadron series as well as doing stuff for the PU.You know, we want to make this world as livable and believable and you guys spend many years adventuring around in it.  And I think in today's world, it's not the way it used to be... where it was like, 'Here's a game, then you put it on the shelf, and then you come back to another game a year or two years later and you sort of iterate it.'  You know, where you have Grand Theft III and IV and V come out.  I think with us, we're just live and we're just continually improving and adding stuff and more people are having fun and adventuring around.

The ladders? In the FPS, you're able to get on the ladder, you're able to climb, you're able to go down.Sean Tracy: So I think the problem is that they haven't seen a lot of the FPS yet and a lot of the FPS levels have a lot more ladders within them. So I think he's actually talking mostly about the ship ladders and different implementation of course than the environment ladders are. There's a whole reason for this, mostly because they have to be items within the ship, there's interactive animation components to it, but essentially those ones have an exit/enter animation whereas the environment ladders actually have the exact functionality he's talking about which is climbing up, climbing down, jumping down.SB: It's really irritating, since you're getting into the ship because it's like (does an example of climbing really slowly).ST: Because you're kind of stuck in this whole thing.SB: (Still acting in slow motion) Maybe I'll go out and get a doughnut, somebody bring the coffee.ST: And you might be under fire.SB: Exactly, so I think that the short answer is because it's an enter animation and it functions as an enter animation that likely you won't be able to go up/down, up/down, up/down, off of it. However the lethargy within a lot of those enter animations drives me crazy.ST: That is a really good word.SB: Thank you, I had that in my back pocket the whole day.ST: Really? You were just waiting to use it, you saw it online one night.SB: We actually are working on creating three different speeds, so we have the relaxed walk speed which is currently what you see in the game for most of the characters. If you want to hit the Caps-Lock button, and he saunters off to grab himself a cappuccino or something, but the default one will be much faster so we're starting to put those in. Then we also have emergency ones, so we had one where the guy runs, and jumps, and clears like three-quarters of the ladder, grabs onto it, jumps in. When we captured this the actor coming out he actually, because we built the Avenger on set like full sized height sort of thing on set obviously we don't need the armor or anything like that, but he was jumping out of it from that height and landing and rolling and everything was cool, and then he missed the landing and he jacked up his ankle and was out for a couple weeks and I felt absolutely terrible.ST: Do you think motion capture actors get, like, workers comp? \"I was jumping out of a pretend spaceship and then...\"SB: Uh, yes through the union I think they might get something but...ST: I just wonder what those reports would look like. \"I was jumping out a spaceship, and I twisted my ankle...\"SB: But I felt like absolute [BLEEP] because he had a great gig coming up, like a couple days later, and he ended up having to call the director and tell him that he couldn't make it because he couldn't, you know, walk. But it was two weeks later he was up on his feet and stuff like that, awesome guy, but yeah they really put their heart and soul into some of these things and their ankles. So we're going to speed those things up.ST: And that's the ship enter stuff and the ladders, again, in the environment act exactly like you've suggested which is pretty standard to most games, you always want that kind of control because you can't be halfway up the ladder and decided to jump off and you have to climb all the way back down.SB: Yeah that would really suck.ST: Yes, that would be super annoying.SB: Cool!", "published_at": "2016-02-08", "published_at_timestamp": 1454972976, "question": "Will ladder climbing ever be given manual control as in most games?

I don't know about the profit sharing, giving someone 20-30%, I think definitely in the first stage of the implementation of the game, that would be a deal you would have to do personally.

So I have a plan that when like Star Trek style if you get hit you know everyone can stagger like this. Or you know you have to in the bigger ship take a big turn. You know people would like move and have some force that way. And so there is some of the stuff that we've been doing which is directly related to what we're doing for the zero-g stuff and the grab and pull stuff that will allow the systems to do that. Where we can cycle through like if a ship gets a hit on the side and it's a big hit we can cycle through all the players or characters inside the ship and anything that's loose and apply an impulse to all of them the same way the impulse would be hitting the ship that you're inside. And then they should procedurally all react to that. I mean there's already some stuff that's in the CryEngine that we're working with, like procedural hit reactions. It's kind of like that side but I would love it to be you have that Star Trek stagger and someone reaches out and braces themselves on the bulkhead. So we're definitely going to be putting that in. First draft of the multi-crew probably won't, cause that's sort of that extra level of sort of animation and simulation detail. But that's definitely going to be going in not hopefully too far after just the base multi-crew because I think that'll sort of give a real sense of like the speed and inertia, what's happening on the ship. So if you it normally and you're not doing crazy evasive maneuvers it's all fine but the moment you have to like do a crazy evasive maneuver then you know people get thrown around a little bit just the same way you see in a classic sub movie.

How do you plan to have this affect larger ships, as they cannot maneuver like fighters, and rely on turrets and gimbals more? Would all of my class two Constellation turrets be downgraded to class one weapons as fixed guns on larger ships would be mostly useless?", "answer": "Ok, there aren't any \"classes\" anymore, we've thrown those out, they've not been in the code for a long time. They were just names for classes of weapons like fixed guns, gimballed guns, turret, manned turret, missile rack etc, but now it's all about sizes and the class, whether you're a weapon or a turret or a missile pylon or an ammo box, or a fuel pod etc etc so there's not really anything to worry about there. The design is the design, I've noticed a whole bunch of people get panicked about a weapon being this class/this size, oh no my ship got gimped etc. It's definitely not the case, that's part of the problem with having an open development plan like we do, it's really not about the statistics! Ultimately where we want to have the Aurora on the scale, against the Hornet on the scale to the Constellation, to the Bengal, they're all going to live in their same relative spaces, I wouldn't get caught up on sizing or class naming on weapons of turrets. I notice a lot of people saying that the Constellation turret(s) should be able to have dual class 4 guns on it, but I think maybe if you want to have a look at what size 2 guns look like on an M50 for example, they look really silly. So the gun sizes and capacities will be matched to the scale and size of the ship, and not some arbitrary numbers we came up with when initially putting it down on paper. Everything is going to relatively sit in the same places, like the Aurora is never going to be a better dogfighter than a Hornet, and the Hornet's turret isn't going to have bigger guns than a Constellation's turret, it just doesn't make sense. The Constellation and bigger ships are very turret dependent, so they'll have turrets and guns that match their scale and capacity, like your question says they'll need to have these as the ships won't be as agile as the smaller ones. Likely the Constellation is not really something you want to use fixed guns with, more like gimbals and turrets! But this is all a work in progress and all statistics etc are meant to change down the track, just like it says at the very top of the ship page!

So one of the things we want to do in the PU is actually allow players to take on these jobs, saying \"I'm travelling from Terra, to say, Stanton, and because of that time spent in space, I'll have these advertising spaces available\". Some in-game organisations/companies might pay for that advertising space for that time the ship has spent in space. We're looking at doing this for the racing part of the game as well, and the paint system that we've been making right now will allow this from players. So mainly for the Hull series at the moment, but we'll expand that in future.Calix Reneau: Yeah, you should be able to visually represent your organisation, and also get some of that sweet ad revenue as well.", "published_at": "2015-02-09", "published_at_timestamp": 1423522808, "question": "Will Player organizations be able to advertise through in game newspapers or billboards?

And yes, you would definitely have them as a character hanging out in your ship, or you \"pad\" as it were - like a hangar or something. So if you basically put together your crew - think of it like Serenity or something - you would see the hanging out, goofing off, doing their various idle states, and you go off and fly, and they're doing the same on the ship. So yes, they would be NPC characters going about... you know, maybe they would have some generic conversational lines. I mean that, to a certain extent will be fairly challenging, because there will be a lot of different potential NPCs and characters, but we'll try out best to make sure they're all-... they have some sense of personality and are kind of fun.", "published_at": "2014-09-08", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 36 (2014.09.08)", "source": "https://youtu.be/a7GBgc4GxAQ", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Failscalator", "published_at_timestamp": 1410213823}, {"objectID": "373679400", "question": "On Organizational \"dues/taxes\", will they be to where the player contributes manually or automatically?", "answer": "I think the answer on that is it will set up by who set up the organization, so I'm sure some organizations will make their contributions voluntary by the people... and some organizations will make them mandatory, and so if you're not actually contributing the leader of the organization can kick you out.

Is it imposed by the flight control system or the physics engine? Isn't the notion of absolute speed an inherent contradiction of newtonian physics? What alternatives have you explored for getting the dogfight feel you want?", "answer": "The in-game rationale, well there's two, right...So there's a practical rationale for the speed limit, as in physics engines break down when you get very large numbers, which would include large speeds, because they just don't have the precision to handle it. Now, we're going to move CryPhysics over to 64-bit as part of our move to double precision, so that'll help a little bit. And then there's fun play-wise. When you're going so fast, you know, it's not that much fun dogfighting. Someone will just flash past you and they'll be gone, and you have to turn around and get on them again, and that would take a long, long time. In the future, real warfare I think in space would mostly revolve completely around computers calculating everything, and whoever has the best computer and targeting solution would probably win the battle.But the in-game rationale for the speed limit, and this also could apply to the real world now, is that if we assume that the ships are flow by humans, and we assume that there isn't really any way of absorbing or counteracting the g-forces that a human body experiences under extreme accelerations... and yes I know that in space, you know, everything's relative so I'm just carrying on going at even the speed of light it's not going to affect me, but the acceleration to get up to a high speed or the acceleration if you're going this way and then you want to go exactly the opposite way back, and if you do that in a short period of time, that's a lot of acceleration. So the concept is if you're going to have real human beings fly, and you don't have anything like gravity absorption technologies, then you probably would want to limit your dogfighting range speed down to a reasonable range. Maybe it wouldn't be as low as what we have, but to a range that's small enough that would not allow the pilot to make radical maneuvers, i.e. going in this direction and then quickly flip the other way in a very short period of time without hurting or killing themselves. So that's kind of the in-fictional stuff is that the way the ships systems work is that when it knows that you're close to other ships and dogfighting, or potentially just trying to avoid them on a collision basis, it keeps your speeds low because obviously at fast speeds you can't also avoid collisions, because to move the distance you would have to do to avoid a collision when you're travelling really fast would create a huge amount of acceleration over a short period of time, which would probably kill the crew or the pilot on board. So the idea is the IFCS would limit the speeds to reasonable amounts when you're doing extreme maneuvers or you're close to other ships where you could have collisions, and then when you're not it allows you to go up to, I think our top warp speed is meant to be 0.2 speed of light, which is pretty damn fast. And then as you get close to other ships and you wouldn't have to ability to avoid them it would bring you back down to maneuvering / dogfighting speed.So that's kind of the in-game fiction. It makes sense also in the practicality of the physics. Would it be limited to the speeds we have? Probably not quite as low, but the other thing we want to do is have it low enough that you can get up close and really appreciate the ships and get that close dogfighting feel. And it's really not that slow, because I'm pretty sure if any of you play multiplayer, or even in the Vanduul Swarm mode, you can collide with things pretty easily coming toward you, because the speed is deceptive. So we're actually doing some other stuff to get across the sense of speed, because you are travelling faster than I think a lot of people realize. We just need to have more of the space dust, a bit more shake as you're going faster, narrow the field of view, a bit louder sound, and I think you'll get a much better sensation or feeling of speed even though you'll be travelling more or less the same distance.", "published_at": "2014-07-14", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 29.

Of course every ship will have a unique ID code, sort of the VIN number in our world, that will identify it. But I don't know, I think if someone becomes really badass and customizes a certain ship, then maybe it can become more famous than its pilot or other ships of the same name.", "published_at": "2014-05-26", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 22.
