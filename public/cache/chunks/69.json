Yes and no. First I'll be a bit more particular and point out that technically the icache service fleet is one part of a larger ecosystem of services and gameside systems for the full global persistence and server streaming architecture. So if we are to just talk about icache itself, then largely it is a custom written solution.

Compared to your earlier work with animal and motion capture for Roughnecks: Starships Troopers Chronicles, how has the technology advanced in the last few decades and are there any drawbacks compared to the earlier methods?", "answer": "Brian Chambers: Tech's made huge steps since I first started. I mean tech's made huge steps in the last few years. When I did the work on the initial season roughnecks, optical mo-cap wasn't really used in production. I think you had some of the larger film effects companies using it, but I don't think any smaller houses or games were at all. At that point we had a magnetic system, flock of birds I think it was called, staged size was limited to 12&Atilde;&mdash;12, 12 feet by 12 feet. It was supposed to be wireless, but it would sense these wireless data packets and occasionally the data packets would drop, which would make the motion completely blow up or freeze so a lot of times we had to run tethered.So you had somebody in these funky suits with all these gyros on them and then even on the software side there was a lot of scripting to get stuff to work. Mapping something, the actual motion to character, it would take a full day to set up a character and get them running when now you can do it now in a couple clicks.Back in the day when we finished stuff and we looked at it, we were so proud seeing characters moving in the environment. When I go back and look at those nowadays, you know you can see the high frequency noise, I kind of cringe, you could see that high frequency noise in the animation, you can see floaty feet, contact isn't really there where it needs to be, but you know that was the day and for the time of what we did I think it was really cool.Today you have huge volumes, you're capturing numerous people at once, you're capturing body, you're capturing face, you're capturing fingers, we're recording audio; we're tracking props, huge volumes if we want to use them. The software is also leaps and leaps and bounds. It's almost to the point to say kids nowadays have it easy, right? But it's true, back in the day it was a lot more archaic, but it was still incredibly new and exciting back then just as the new stuff is coming online now so it's cool.", "published_at": "2016-06-06", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 13", "source": "https://youtu.be/hp5AlLytcn0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "MisterCole", "published_at_timestamp": 1465251642}, {"objectID": "183ceeb5872ae5_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "It'll be flexible.

And I may be the wrong person to answer this question. Striking a work life balance when you're working on something you're passionate about, is incredibly difficult. Prioritising life is very difficult to do. We are all very passionate about what we're working on here.We're working for someone who is also very passionate about what he is creating, and I think it rubs off on all of us. We all want to be here until we know and this thing needs to be done. There is so much to do, and so much we want to do, I rarely go home and feel like I accomplished everything I planned for, for that day. But I do feel like I made a chunk, I've gotten a chunk doneGaige Hallman: That's the best feeling. You feel like you made a difference that day and you're ready for the next one.EKD: That's right, that's right. So sometimes you just got to put your pencil down and go home because you've been here so long. Sometimes you have to plan life. Make sure you take a vacation, make sure you use some of that PTO time that we've got, those wonderful benefits. Sometimes hey you got to put in all the hours and do what you got to do what you got to do. It's really tough, I don't know, It's hard to explain when you're working on something you love. When do you want to stop?I think the goal is, you want to do something you love so much, that you never want to stop doing it! So we have to force ourselves even more to take a break, step away from it, go have fun, go do a team event, have a little holiday party. Whatever the case might be, go out see a movie have a break when you can.GH: I think you've been a big part of that too. Like since you came on board the environment has definitely improvedEKD: Cool, thank you. And then on another note, I think to speak to this question. The Management team, the Executive team, they're incredibly supportive on just life happening. If something occurs, or something goes on, you know they've got your back and you can take the time you need to make sure life's sorted out, and it just seems like, and I know this from the leadership side of me.We are always proactively trying to look at: are people burning out?, Are they working too hard?, Is it what they're working on what they should be working on?, and how can we simplify that to make their lives better?, when do we tell them to just go home, be away, take time off. Because those are all the things we're trying to look out forGH: That just happened, I remember earlier this week when trying to work on 2.4 Forest and Sean kept telling me \"Go home, you've got to go home\".EKD: That's right. So we try to do it for ourselves but then for those that we are also responsible for we also try to take care of them. The ultimate goal is to not crunch and if we're doing our job and we have a good understanding of the schedule, which I say it but it it's very hard to do! It is trying to get reduced any kind of crazy over time needed. Be able to do your job within the hours allotted to you that's fair and equal to your, whereever you live but also for our mental state. The reason those exist, it gets to the point of diminishing returns.You've got to be healthy and if something happens CIG totally supports it and i've seen that happen time and time again even since i've been here.

Saol... Mr... Saouldian. Yeah, I think that's good. Sao. Saoldian. Sao Saoldian. Saoldian. Sao Saoldian. Yeah I know, it's just the question starts with his name. Saoldian. Sao Saoldian. Sao Saoldian, no idea how to say this. Sao Saoldian asks: Will our character's animation change when injuries are incurred? Occurred? I don't know if it's my grammar or their grammar, but something's wrong there.Steve Bender: No, it's definitely your grammar.ST: When injuries are incurred...Thomas Hennessy: You incur the injury. Their grammar is correct in this instance.SB: For example, if our right arm is shot, will it go limp and therefore cause us to switch the weapon to the left hand...ed... see? no, that's his bad.ST: Left hand, comma, or will he/she limp orSB: No, see, it says will it go limp and therefore cause us to switch the weapon to the left handed.ST: Oh. Nope.SB: Nope. Or will he or she limp or move slower if there's a leg injury?ST: Question mark. I don't know why I put the question mark there...SB: That's a good question.ST: It is a good question.SB: So, ahh, yes. You'll be having characters, will begin to change the way that they move and interact with injuries. So if i get shot in the leg, I'm going to start to limp. If i get shot in the arm, that arm will no longer be useable. Now, there's a certain amount of shot in the arm, like the likely one shot will not put your arm completely out of commission, but, there's a couple challenges that we have in this though. In that, it's about balancing this. So, when I get shot in the leg, and I'm moving, how fast am I moving? Because you know, we shot this stuff on set, we actually shot actors in the leg. not with real bullets but you know, we threw things at them. You know. Just sort of ...ST: Yeah, just give them a beating.SB: And stuff like that right? Give them a good charlie horse. And then they tried to move, and it actually, whereas it looks good on camera, it's one of those things in first person / third person where it just felt really slow. So, within the design we have injuries. So when you get shot in the leg, you're going to be limping forward, when you get shot in the arm, likely we won't be holding our arm down, if I get shot in the left arm I'm going to want to keep it up here because I want to make sure that, you know, I keep my arm above my heart level so I don't bleed out, and you know, that gives us opportunities to do things with the weapon. So, for instance, if I get shot in the arm, perhaps I have to go to pistol, so I drop my rifle, I'm going to draw out my pistol, but I can't go to two hand, so I have to go one hand right? And how does that change your accuracy with the weapon when you move with the weapon and things like this. Yeah. If you get shot in the right hand, you're holding the weapon in the right hand what the hell happens?ST:L What about things like reload and things like that too? So I guess you'd have to have some level of one-hand reloads, you'd have to have all these kinds of things right?SB: Yeah, we had one of our mocap actors is a special operator, a British special operator, and he did this really badass one-handed reload.ST: Is Chris a special operator?SB: I don't know... is he?ST: I think so. I think all the British..SB: Really? You think it's like that secret... like the Kingsmen right?ST: Oh it's totally like that where the all go in and they haveSB: Right? ExactlyST: Chris has a Cappucino.SB: [fist explodes desk] That's got to be it! Watch out with that. So, so what were we talking about?ST: Special operators.SB: Right. So, we had a Glock, and he was doing this thing with this Glock where he just... he had ammo kind of like this, and he would eject and this would go in and then he would like grab it in this funky grip and goST: Holy shitSB: And go scrunch it together like this, the slide would go back, and then it would pop up, the whole gun would pop up, and he'd catch it in his hand and he'd be able to fire. It's [BEEP] [BEEP] I was sitting there and he was just sort of waiting for the next take and I saw him doing this I was like.. what the f... is that? Do it again!ST: Do it again! Turn on the cameras!SB: Get the cameras on this. So, yeah. Absolutely we're going to have a lot of that stuff in the game.ST: So yeah, I think the summary is yes. You will have animations change when injuries are incurred. Awesome.  Cool.SB: And, good grammar. Don't let him tell you otherwise. So... next one is for you mister Tracy!ST: I'm excited!SB: It's not for me and you, it's just for you.ST: It's just me.SB: And it's you CIG, and this is from Alien Eagle.ST: Good one, Alien Eagle.", "published_at": "2016-02-08", "published_at_timestamp": 1454972976, "question": "Will our character's animation change when injuries are incurred?

And sometimes we have the power of limitations govern what the design is based on whether its OP, whether it's functional. But the main thing is each ship is completely different. In the case of the Caterpillar we put a lot into what it was intended to do.The original intent was search and rescue then we started looking at some of the other ones like the variants which the possibility of variants were the merchant marine and small scale salvage then we started looking at what does a search and rescue need. So search and rescue you need a medical bay. Boom you got a medical bay check. You need a place to house the crew as well as your medical crew so bam there's an extra personnel one there and then you need cargo just in case, you also need launch bays so that way you can get people launched out to go save people and stuff. So kind of like this like the dive rescuersKirk Tome: Sure. I think what we're describing though is the whole top down approach. First the ship functions itself is determined and then once we determined the particular type of function then we design the module so that it will serve that function and what those needs are for that particular module. So we keep diving down deeper to try to figure out, because for us as designers we're determining what the player interactions with the ships are and therefore to accomplish those particular tasks that the ship is suited for what works best as far as the components in this case the modules on that shipRV: Also feasibility. Because I made a couple of modules or designed and specced some and people were like \"hmmm I don't know if that would work\" or \"we need to tone that down\". Just to make sure it wasnt crazy over powered.KT: Tell them about some of the examples that have been designed out so far.RV: We have the medical bay, we have the cargo bay we have some of the personnel bays and we have multiple variants even of the different modules themselves so like we have two different cargo modules.KT: What are the differences?RV: One of the cargo modules has a cat walk so you would lose about 15-20 SCU for the catwalk but because it's a catwalk you can walk through the entire cargo and get to the entire ship. Cause if you fill an entire bay with cargo then you can't walk through it. So if you wanted to get to the other side of the ship  basically you have to either exit the ship to go back in through a different dock or something like that. The player can set up the ship how ever they want and based on what modules they choose for their ship they have to deal with the consequences of ok this is what this has for strengths and this is what this module does.KT: That's good. There are positives and negatives to each type and players will determine what's best for themRV: Or the ones you're playing with. Everyone's talking about pirates so we're talking about more attack more aggressive type of modules to add to it and also the ones that you won't let go but the cargo still has hardpoints on it. So each side of the bay has tractor beam hardpoints like size ones so if you wanted to you could swap those tractor beams out for like two size ones so you could pew pewKT: I wouldn't I would stick with tractor beamsRV: You never know people want to put guns on the bays and cargo bays.

The usual easy, hard, insane kinda stuff. To be honest with you, I haven't really figured out the variations of the mode but they usually normally revolve around, quite how accurate or how tough the AI are. So, we'll have an easier mode although I don't want to make it too easy because I sorta feel like modern games have gotten away from what made games in the old days sorta work, cause if nothing's a challenge to achieve then there's no satisfaction from finishing it. So, that's one of the things I sorta appreciated with Demon's Souls when I played it quite a few years ago. I was like, 'Oh, I remember this' because I had been playing all these games that were sort of the typical first person or the cover shooters and you die, you respawn within 2 seconds of where you died. There was no penalty for messing up or not doing stuff right and Demon's Souls there definitely was a penalty, very frustrating at times, but it kept me playing. When I finished a level and killed the boss, I was very proud of myself and that's one of the few games I played to completion and then again, that's saying a lot for me. I definitely put a lot of time into it so I'm not necessarily saying it will be as hard as Demon's Souls but I definitely want it to be like the Wing Commanders where you have to complete your mission before you went on, you couldn't sort of go save every two steps which you can in some of the modern games. I kinda feel like you don't want it to be a fully nanny state where you're always going to take care of people so you need to run this balance between not being too frustrating but also be challenging enough that you're happy and satisfied when you do it.

We'll be supporting TrackIR, we'll be supporting Oculus Rift, we'll probably be supporting Valve's Vive and if they ever get Morpheus onto a PC maybe we'd support that too, some other versions of stuff, like Magic Leap etc. There's definitely work that's going on to support some of these features, not in the current builds but we'll be including them later on. We have 3 or 4 builds going at once, so the team that's working with the FPS module is using a slightly more advanced version of the engine than what you have with AC, then the social module guys are on an even more advanced version, and finally the SQ42 and multicrew ship combat are using the \"main\" version which is the most advanced one. We do this so that the modules that are released now and in the near future stay stable, so we don't introduce any game breaking issues as they get to you. The new VR stuff will come in down the road, I'm thinking that it'll come with some of the Multicrew stuff later this year, but it's all about prioritising what we have to get out. So we're finishing off the large world, which we're nearly finished now, we're just on the 3D rendering/camera relative stuff now. Some base engine streaming stuff that we're working on to bring in the massive amounts of data this game needs at any one time.

But know that we will support everything and anything we can get our hands on, we're not gong to go exclusive to any peripherals.", "published_at": "2015-03-30", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 58 (2015.03.30)", "source": "https://youtu.be/joKjDdKcOMQ", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Anomnom", "published_at_timestamp": 1427752772}, {"objectID": "373679750", "answer": "Calix Reneau: I have no idea, I've been stuck inside the ships, mostly in cargo stuff!Dan Tracey: I actually developed the early parts of the star-map, for the original prototyping of the PU. The prototype is there, though it's completely broken right now, but it's there and it did work. We have talked about this a lot with Austin and the PU team about how we're going to instance out certain sections of star systems so that was you have a local area which is instanced to a particular server, to set up a realistic scale. What we wanted to do is to extrapolate from the star system, so a bit like a top down view of a star system showing planets orbiting at different rates, then bring that into these individual instances realistically. This is going to be a headache to make, but we are going to do it, or at least try to, we'll let you know when we have more specific information. Right now it's a lot of setting up the back end servers, implementing double precision, but we haven't been able to thoroughly test beyond that, we're working on and looking at jump points with more priority. I don't want to say it's definitely possible, but we're looking into it and we'll let you know as it comes up.", "published_at": "2015-02-09", "published_at_timestamp": 1423522808, "question": "This discussion always comes up in the forums and what we are wondering is if planets, moons, etc will have properly simulated orbits in each star system?", "source": "https://youtu.be/eb01zlo_MvM", "title": "10 for the Designers: Episode 01 (2015.02.09)", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "TigerHeart", "time": "5m23s"}, {"objectID": "373678940", "question": "Do you rely on any Guiding Principles when making game design decisions? You've referenced \"this is what would happen in real life\" a few times so I take that as one but do you have others that guide your problem solving?", "answer": "Well, quite a few! I mean, obviously real life is a really great example and, you know, past history, are good examples because you can see sort of how something works. And also people that are playing the game can also really relate to it because it's something they have seen everyday in real life. So, the idea of, say, insurance on a spaceship you can relate to because you have insurance on your car, and for the same kind of reasons that we would have in space. So definitely having some level of real life inform the gameplay, but of course, you want to make the game FUN - so that's a big guiding principle. So it's sort of focusing on much more of the fun aspects, and less of sort of the boring, mundane aspects, because I think most people - even glamorous people - a lot of their day-to-day stuff is fairly mundane, and of course you're not play a game to do mundane things! (Maybe if you're playing something like The Sims, but even The Sims is a very abstracted kind of more fun version of real life!)So I would say that real life is part of it. Part of it is making it fun - sort of the bit where you feel empowered, and you feel special, and can do cool stuff that you can't normally do in real life. But then also to a certain extent making it be easy at the beginning - sort of draw you in. Like, one of my big principles is I really like immersion, and immersion I think is really facilitated by really rendering the environment, the world, the characters, like in very high fidelity. And even though you could say, \"well, the game mechanics aren't particularly different,\" when you render something put a little extra care and attention to detail in it, it makes that world seem more alive. I mean a really good example is the Uncharted series that Naughty Dog has done, and if you look at the base gameplay mechanics it's not that different than what Tomb Raider did a long time ago, but the difference is they added all these little details and moments. You know, like Drake's going up a staircase and he reaches and touches the banister. It sort of all makes it feel a bit more real and alive, and the same with The Last of Us has a lot of these touches too. And so the same gameplay mechanics that maybe in another game don't feel quite feel as connected, do in something like an \"Uncharted\" because the attention to detail sort of pulls you in and so all of a sudden you start putting yourself in that world instead of always thinking of playing a game. So having a high amount of immersion is a big principle for me to really just pull you into the game. Because, you know, even if we look at what we're doing in Star Citizen, a lot of the core game mechanics aren't that much different than what we've done in the past on things like Wing Commander, or Privateer, or Freelancer. And there is a lot more sophistication, there's a lot more stuff, but some of the core ideas, like the whole idea of travelling between planets and earning money so you can upgrade your ship or buy a new ship, has been around for a long time, but it's a very satisfying sort of play path. And so we're just sort of doing that with a high fidelity, and we've got a lot more tweaks and of course there's the multiplayer and the co-operative aspects, and there's a lot of things that are gonna make it really rich. BUT, you know it's still the same basic core game mechanics which, if you look at a lot games, the core mechanics tend to have been very similar for a long time, and a lot of it's about implementation, and the nuance, and sort of accessibility for people.So I would say for me, my game design principles are about immersion, they're about accessibility, they're about adding depth to a game beyond the accessibility, right - so there's a very famous saying which is sort of like, \"easy to learn, difficult to master,\" and I think that's a very good paradigm for games. I mean it's much easier said than done, but in general it's something that you want to have in your game, so someone can just pick it up and have fun, but they don't feel like they've mastered it and they're bored with it right way - it takes a long time. So, I would say something like a \"Starcraft\" or something like that had a very good sort of \"easy to learn, difficult to master,\" thing where you could play it, and you could just play it with the mouse, but if you really wanted to get good at it, it just took a lot more time and attention, and you had to be a whole different level of player. And so that's kind of one of the things that we want to do in Star Citizen, and then in general just create this really big world where I'm really going for a sandbox to allow people to do what they wanna do, and sort of live out their fantasy life in space. I mean, it's a fantasy that I've had, and I think most of you guys out there have had.So those are all aspects that go into the design. So, I wouldn't-... I'm not saying there's any sort of silver bullet. A lot of it also is all sort of instinct and intuition of, like what seems to make sense to me, versus anything else. And I just happen, I think to a certain level, to have a sense of gameplay and style that a lot of other people sort of agree with. But there you go! There's my principles... if that helps at all?!", "published_at": "2014-09-08", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 36 (2014.09.08)", "source": "https://youtu.be/a7GBgc4GxAQ", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "SmartAce", "published_at_timestamp": 1410213823}, {"objectID": "373683340", "question": "Will there be some sort of recognition for the player organizations that contribute the most to the Synthworld project? I think this would be a great way for the UEE to generate more interest in the project, and can the project be \"completed\" in game?", "answer": "So that's actually a pretty cool idea. I mean I don't think we were necessarily planning on players actually contributing to the Synthworld project, because it was this thing that was built and then abandoned because they ran out of money, but one of the big things we want to do is have a lot of player generated initiatives. I know there's already the \"Operation Pitchfork\" that's going on, and so on some levels even though we were gonna have Vanduul raiders and Vanduul areas of space that was part of our plan in the universe to place where you have engagements, we may actually put some content in that allows people to sort of go and \"fight the good fight\" so to speak. And I think the Synthworld could be something along those lines too, so we will take that into consideration, because we're definitely looking for big-picture things that organisations can contribute to. So we have lots of different things you can do in the game, so either you can just do your solo stuff running around, or you and small groups, or there's gotta be sort of bigger objectives for larger groups of people. That's a pretty cool idea, so uhh, we'll think about it! That's something to definitely throw into the Persistent Universe pot, so to speak.", "published_at": "2014-07-21", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 30.
