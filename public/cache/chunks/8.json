An example would be going back with the new item system, we have these entities or items that they have &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; I love having this stuff, maybe it has this cup as what it looks like and its physics. So if I hits the cup, it reacts and it is just one thing that does need a slot where this geometry and physics go. We can have a number of slots, but for most part, we have one slot and our old items had one slot, but to get this interaction system up and running, we needed to have physics in different locations, maybe this opens a door, this one turns on power. So we had to have another physics thing, so now we have two slots in this entity and we have to physicalize both and it should have been as simple as saying negative one and what that would do is if it's negative one, it would go through each slot and physicalize it.That was something we did about two years ago for the vehicle system, however it was working when we attached these items to ships, but then as soon as you detach it and put it on the ground, it had no physics and it was because of that change; everyone was like. \"What's going on? This used to work, this worked two years ago.\"RV: It's always kind of funny when bugs like that pop up because you guys are fighting old code and then me like, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, so we want this to happen, why is this happening?\" and then like dig in. Sometimes I know you guys are like... one time he came over to my desk and was like, you had 12 different files open and you're just like, \"I just don't know where it is\".MA: I'm just tracing back to the history-RV: YeahMA: But ultimately I did find what was causing that and it was when it hit negative one it early aborted while the code back then was just missing and I literally was tracing back the history to find what happened because this code was there and I find it way back, I think a year ago it was an integration from a new engine version to some new tech for 64-bit and during that it removed some code and we never noticed this because we never had to do this type of thing.The vehicles ended up getting completely different code, so we never noticed it until we put this item in and then so yeah it was like, \"Alright he's the old code that used to work\", and now when we plop this thing on the ground, it has physics and it's just like [raises his arms in exasperation], the history is haunting me. It's like I fixed this years ago!RV: And I don't envy that at all.MA: But luckily, oh I love proforce, you can just scroll through the history and go where did it go? Where did it go? There it is!

I'm the one that's doing the design for field repairs.Matthew Sherman: What are some of the things that you're using as a reference?CR: In terms of actual gameplay loop, there is actually some good ground tread already, and we have some military folks to bring it back into reality. The loops that I'm looking at are more built around having small discrete actions, but having a wide variety of those. Any given problem will be dynamic and different to solve, and players will have a lot to react to. It won't be a big deal actually accomplishing a repair, but the difficulty lies in looking for what needs repairing and how to do it. I'm takng cues from Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, which came out at the perfect time for inspiration, as well as trauma centre. So these are really simple interactions, but layered such that they're interesting and complex. I've also been taking cues from Penumbra, the direct interaction with the world and with the objects that you're plugging back into your war-torn vessel.

We do have plans for sort of atmospheric entry and atmospheric flight, we all kind of want to do... if you seen Prometheus, the sort of Prometheus entry down onto the planet or if you go back to Aliens they had a very cool... well, the effects aren't as nice as in Prometheus but going through the storm and you know the clouds and the turbulence. So, we definitely want that depending on the kind of planet, potentially a planet you could go down and find minerals and strip and gather resources that you could sell for a lot of money. It should perhaps be quite dangerous to get down there and maybe you have to figure out how to get down there without getting caught up in huge storms or the rest of the stuff.So, we want to make that part of the future, we've been discussing it and obviously John Pritchett our flight guru so we've already been going back and forth on some of that. Of course, we have quite a few other things to do but we are planning sort of clouds on planets and weather systems and all the rest of the stuff so we'll definitely ultimately have that and I think it will be a pretty cool experience. It won't be any time in the near future but it's definitely something we are planning and I don't know if you necessarily go to a full length scientific analysis but there will be certain kinds of planets that will be more dangerous to enter and will require some skill to enter but I think there will be rewards if you get down there.

Whether that be through used ship dealerships or via trading with other players.", "answer": "I would say that long term that probably will be a way to buy and sell used ships. Shorter term what's going to happen is you're definitely going to be able to sell your used ship which you will sell at a discount, but probably will only be new ships available to buy at the dealership. So you would go to a dealership and go \"Oh I'll trade in your used Aurora for this and get this new ship so you need to pay me the difference\".That will be happening pretty early, but having dedicated used ship sales places probably won't be for a little bit. That's sort of a lower priority. We've had the same discussions on clothes like could you go and sell your used clothes and then you have the equivalent of a thift store. While that's kind of a cool idea, it's simpler on the game mechanics side to sell the item at a discount since it's now been used and then you just buy new items.That's kind of where we're at, longer term we will probably allow sort of buying and having maybe used car dealerships, but you know you gain the ship and it's got has some wear and tear on it and rundown so it's probably needs somebody to fix or it may not operate as optimally until you can fix it up. That's kind of it, trading with other players we're definitely going to allow you to sell and trade with other players. There's going to be some rules and limits to it to avoid the abuse of it and they'll probably have to be things like title transfer tax and stuff like that when you sell a ship to another player, you have to pay the UEC or money to transfer the title just like you do on say a car here in the US.", "published_at": "2016-01-04", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 74", "source": "https://youtu.be/qqcN6UkKfog", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "SneezyDinosaur", "published_at_timestamp": 1451947767}, {"objectID": "373680810", "question": "Has there ever been any thought about having 'live' NPCs?

There's some limitations to that because of the way instancing works is that we would have to either have a bunch of different actors that some people were experiencing and I think there would be kind of some technical issues but a lot of the stuff that was addressed in here about this gangland boss coming into a bar and starting trouble and giving people jobs to do, is something we actually want you all to be able to do as players to be able to take on these roles. To be mission generators yourselves and to really roleplay these cool characters and interact with each other, So whereas we might see the tools for you to do that it'll be fun to see how you as players take on these roles and cause troubles and start off your own plot points that we can pick up on.Adam Wieser: And yeah on the other side of that too the players that are starting to see the trouble roll down the hill and kind of come in collectively go, \"Wait a minute I saw that guy over there\" and trying to maybe being able to counteract what that person might be trying to do to.WW: But yeah we'll have to think more about mind jacking NPC\"s like all of a sudden the bartender slowly look at you.

Design has been working on a way to make that work, but there are some challenges such as a significant advantage while you're playing the FPS, having so much more screen space. And you can't obviously stretch it across three monitors, you actually need the extra FoV. So, that's kind of a difficult one, and I'm not sure exactly how that is going to work. If you guys have suggestions, I'm sure, throw them into the forums and ask Design, and give your suggestions on how to make that work.

Is that kind of like having three monitors?OA: Well, I've tried the Oculus one time, I don't necessarily think it's like having three monitors, because you can just look to the left and to the right, it covers your whole face, but I think depending on... certain games you can change your FoV, but for certain games...FS: I love when they do that, like racing games, and you have like... you've got your joystick...OA: Oh, the windows at the side, yeah that's so cool. I don't know how we're going to be able to do that to where it's not a tactical advantage.

A lot of people seem to think so. Could you walk us through beginning to end, the process of taking a feature, from an idea out of Chris Roberts' head (or someone elses) all the way to being played on our computers, including some obstacles you run into and how you overcome them?", "answer": "DV: That's actually... it's kind of a sequel to this question here on a lot of times we do have to limit those ideas. A good example of that would be... the Vanguard that Calix... It was a variant that Calix was working on. And he had this idea of a certain role that he wanted the variant to have. It was a great idea but once the ship team and the designers and the production sat down and looked at how does that variant fit with the rest of the functionality of that ship realized it wasn't one that fit with its role. So we had to kind of cut that variant out and then just start building the rest of the variants from there. Or at least I'd design and document the design briefs on how we wanted the rest of the variants to go. So to kind of echo what Eric was saying last question, we do have some blue sky ideas. So we sit down, we look at what we want to have in each fixed version that we're releasing, each patch. So for example right now we're getting ready to work on 1.1.5 and then after that we've got the next version after that, next version after that, next version after that. We have what features we want listed for those versions and that pretty much helps us plan out what tech we need to have ready by when. What ships do we have to have ready and flyable by a certain date. And that dictates what tasks we give to our designs, our programmers, our artists. So by having those ideas roadmapped out, roadmapping those actually is a skillset in itself. Because we can't just say you know, \"This month we want one ship that does this. Next month we want a hundred people to be able to fly all these ships around the planet at the same time.\" That's not very realistic. So we have to have at least realistic expectations when we put these plans together. But this is where a lot of communication for production comes from, talking with designers, talking with artists. And you kind of come to a consensus on what's possible, can we do this, is this a good idea and the direction we want to take the game. And ultimately Chris is the ultimate authority on whether something.. on whether we want to take the game a certain direction or not.EKD: Yeah. And I think to part of the question about the feature as well. There's the planning and the ideas and then there's the work time. And that's kind of the magic, that's the magic fingers part. We get these really talented people together, they construct a plan for how to get this done, we help track it, we help keep them on pace to make sure we hit those deadlines. We work together, things fluidly move around as quickly as humanly possible to get it done. And then magically it's done. We test it with QA, we make sure it works, and then we get it out to you guys. So without going into taking a feature and then saying this artist did this, and this developer did that, and this programer did that, it is kind of magic. It's just you get a bunch of very good people who know exactly what they're doing with their job and they take pieces and they are really proactive with it and get it done. Cause we're all super passionate about what we're doing.DV: And a lot of things that go on behind the scenes that you don't see is someone staying here till one o'clock in the morning just waiting for someone in the UK office to get in just because they have to ask them a question regarding something that needs to be fixed right away.EKD: That's right.DV: So there's a lot of challenging things that go on behind the scenes. It's not as easy as you know Mark having magic fingers. As much as we wish him to have magic fingers to be able to just fix things on a whim, he just waves his keyboard wand and everything just gets fixed.EKD: [laughing] Yeah that's right.DV: There's a lot of difficulty that goes into that.EKD: That's right.", "published_at": "2015-07-13", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 09 (2015.07.13)", "source": "https://youtu.be/ouf5jzk9qg0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Weyoun \"six\" of Imperium", "published_at_timestamp": 1436825509}, {"objectID": "373682430", "question": "Does CryEngine support inverse square light falloff?", "answer": "Forrest Stephan: It does.

The economy is actually his... ummm... it's something he's very keen on, and he's working hard on. And we are definitely building an economy module to separate. So we actually have a sort of economy simulation that happens, and there's actually going to be, sort of the brains, that will run most of the Persistent Universe, and simulate where the NPCs are moving around, trading, what the players are doing... all the rest of the stuff.On our side we will definitely have where we'll have the economy simulation and we can sort of see and zoom to different planets or systems to see what's happening. Long-term, once the game is up and fully running the Persistent Universe, and everyone is playing in it, we'll probably have some control room that, we'll sit there and they'll have monitors of the different states of the systems. And we'll be able to see what's happening in the Persistent Universe - what the NPCs are doing, what the players are doing - and then occasionally sort of tweak things if we need to tweak things.Whether or not we will release that as a module for people to play with, my guess is probably not. But we definitely are building that as a module, because we need it as an internal side. So, I don't know, but maybe I'd have to talk to Tony, but I don't see a really good way to release that to individual backers, because it's really a more server-side thing, and so it sort of plugs into a lot of our back-end server subsystems.
