But I haven't really done one at GDC. Maybe I did one like at gamescom not this year but the year before I did one and I guess that's a European GDC? I'm not sure whether.. We definitely are doing, I think I made my points fairly consistently about what we try to engaging the community and sharing the work we're doing and by doing that and also having the ability to iterate and make things better because you have a community involved and giving you feedback on a level that you wouldn't have with a sort of internal development team or internal testing.I definitely see people out there that are sort of taking to heart the more community driven development process. We're not the only ones that do that by the way. There are people who have been community driven in the past as well but I certainly think that the fact that we've managed to mount a project this ambitious with the support of everyone out there has opened a lot of eyes because it's a totally different way.Before people dismissed crowdfunding and doing things the openway has been a small niche thing to do but were not small or niche, were competing with the biggest projects out there and it's all because of you guys and that's pretty good so I definitely see when I talk to people in the industry on the gaming side, there's a lot of people that have paid attention to that and understand the power of it and like I said I don't think we're the only people that have ever done that, it's not unique to us. I just think we've sort of committed it wholeheartedly and that's helped out. I do think that in some ways we are helping sort of change things slowly, crowdfunding has done that as well.So, there you go.. I mean it's kind of hard to say giving an example, you can kind of see some other crowdfunding campaigns and they do sort of follow a lot the processes we started. I definitely know that even in the case of Shroud of the Avatar quite a while ago I was tellingRichard: \"Hey you should go and crowdfund\" and when they were starting it perhaps Richard would tell us. We had some chats and I'm like yeah this is kind of what worked for us and they've been doing an amazing job themselves. I'm always impressed how consistent they are, how they're constantly pushing out new content, how they're engaging their community and there doing a great job and to be honest with you there are a lot of other crowdfunding campaigns that are doing a good job of that too.We've shouted out a view of them and backed a few and I think you'll also see longer term even publishers sort of embrace the model of engaging the community early, giving them access, giving them an opportunity to feedback and make them feel like they're involved with the process.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 70", "source": "https://youtu.be/ezrghcBRcSk", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Draconis", "published_at_timestamp": 1447716094}, {"objectID": "373681050", "question": "Since all is coming together now and game mechanics are getting more and more complex, how do you plan to introduce the specific parts like electronic warfare, mining, etc... to players?", "answer": "Well, good of you to ask because that's I've been been talking about. So the whole idea is sort of SC Alpha 1.3 baby PU, whatever you want to call it. That is where we're bringing in all the new game mechanics. So for instance, when we have the voxel asteroids up and running and we can mine them we would start spawning far asteroids fields built from voxels out somewhere in the large world map and you could fly out to it in your mining ship and you'll be able to mine and bring minerals back and sell them for some money at a location space station or if by that time we actually have the planetary landings in, Land down on the planetary landing and sell them down on the ground so the idea is that the mechanics on some things like mining, electronic warfare, all of those sort of things are going to be tested, evolved,  polished in this large world map that we have in SC 1.3 and onwards and that's how we're getting a lot the functionality out there in the wild and getting feedback on it and that will form the basis of star citizen so I think once that comes out it's going to be pretty cool because you'll start to the possibility in gameplay that you don't see right now, cause  right now if you're flying out in the space  it's pretty much arena commander  and it's close quarters dogfighting and that's it. So everyone very much focuses on balance for close quarter dogfighting controls for close quarters dogfighting but you know the ultimate star citizen game will have so much more than that, it's only one small component of the gameplay they'll be adventure components or exploration components, Trading components all these things that are going to make the star citizen universe incredibly rich and that the fidelity we're doing which hasn't really been seen before. and that's going to roll out in the large world setting that we're doing for the multi crew and so there you go! That's where we're going to test it and we'll be looking forward to your feedback.", "title": "10 For the Chairman: Episode 67", "source": "https://youtu.be/yLjk2UvfFRA", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Aeras Gatherford", "published_at_timestamp": 1442872931}, {"objectID": "18cecf325dfd17_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "We have the Archimedes planned, which was included on the Constellation Phoenix.

Will the AI fly the point like a player would, or will an NPC ship just auto-magically traverse the point with a small \"dice-roll\" that results in a jump point accident?", "answer": "Generally the NPC AI, if you're not SEEING them do stuff, their AI will be resolved on a higher level. The PU servers might simulate 20 million NPC agents, but you might not be able to see that at any one time. So think about it like a civilisation game, so we've got all these AI agents that are off working out trading numbers, combat stuff in unseen areas etc. A factory might need a mission for 100T of goods to come from somewhere, that generates a mission, AI might take that mission, then there might be pirates in the aerospace that get close enough to endanger the cargo, the universe would have some kind of simple combat resolution to work out what happened. If you're not around to see it, then that's what'd happen, a higher server based calculation. If you're around that area when it happens, the universe might say there's a 60% chance that you'll see a ship of this type taking these goods from here to here, and there is a 40% chance that it'll be attacked by a pirate of this type and this armament. So when you're going past that area, we're calling it an encounter-cue, the universe simulator says ok this is what's going on in this area of space right now, lets roll a dice, YEP you're going to see one of those pirates or transports, so you might drop out at that point. Lets say you fight the pirate off and save the trader, that would then go back up to the universe server through the chain, saying that pirate was killed there, it'll drop off the 20 million NPCs list, so now if another ship flies through that area, the universe knows there isn't a pirate there, so now there might only be a 60% chance you see a transport ship rather than the pirate/transport encounter someone else had earlier. So essentially what happens is, the big picture simulation of people going about their daily lives all happens on the universe simulation server, then what you see is a snapshot from your part of space on the game simulation server, then your actions and outcomes from instances on that game simulation server are fed back up to the universe sim servers to update everything. It's not really 100% answering about the Jump Point question, but it's an explanation as to how things work overall. So basically when things are spawning into your game simulation, they'll work on proper in-game AI, but if you're not seeing it, it'll be done on the higher-level server side, less granularly. The design we're using is really nice because of the fuzzy-logic approach, everything you see is high fidelity, and everything you do is pushed up to the universal side, so there is a lot of possibility of a living, breathing universe. There are a lot of cool things we've got in the works that we can't really share at the moment, but things like characters or personalities that persist etc. It's all very next level, definitely more than we've seen in anything else we know of.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 53 (2015.02.16)", "source": "https://youtu.be/N2K1CH22SF8", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Fogadus", "published_at_timestamp": 1424127628}, {"objectID": "373677460", "question": "How will players be able to establish relationships with NPCs? Will NPCs ever initiate interaction with the player, perhaps coming to them with a job, as suggested by the MISC Freelancer commercial?", "answer": "Yes, I think I answered this last week. Not exactly this question, but essentially the same question, but yes, sometimes the NPCs will initiate interactions and come to them with jobs. Jobs are put out there on our jobs board, by the economy system which is essentially the AI. Other players can also do it. Players can pick up the jobs. Other NPCs can pick up the job. Our goal in the game is to have our NPCs and AI be active, not just reactive. In terms of you go to some guy that's the guy who gives missions in the bar, and you walk to him and he goes, \"Oh I've got a job for you.\" Well there will be some cases where people or an AI could potentially seek you out and go, \"Hey I've got a mission for you.\" Versus being reactive, and that's kind of a strong underlying goal with what we want to do to make the NPCs seem real and living, and having their own goals and agendas. Where they're not just focused on what they're doing right now. That is what I call tactical AI, y'know they're great at combat, they can hide behind cover, they can try and flank you but anything beyond that instance of combat they've got not sense of what their goal is today, what their goal is this year. Y'know, what do they want to do? They want to be the best pirate or the best trader.

This Saturday in Australia (so more like Friday for \"everybody else\") we'll have much more info on that side of things so stay tuned for that. It'll change the gameplay from the typical respawn type gameplay you have in most FPS games. We'll also have healing/repair roles in space for people/ships to take, so the repair/support roles, like repairing or rearming and refuelling other ships, so they could rejoin the battle. We'll probably create a game mode in AC to show them off later down the track. The idea of AC is sort of a test bed for all the stuff in the PU, so we'll build scenarios around that to test things we thing might happen in the PU. So there might be one where there are 2 landing pads and a refuelling depot where you can refuel and land, and 2 teams are fighting over that space. When we get the multicrewed ships and more diverse role-type ships in AC you'll see a lot more of that kind of game happening.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 43 (2014.10.27)", "source": "https://youtu.be/phk-0zch1NI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Attackat", "published_at_timestamp": 1414447201}, {"objectID": "373679080", "question": "Will we be able to board and capture all ships and stations in the PU?

So that would definitely be an exception. I can't think of any ships that would be like that, but it would definitely be the non-persistent stations - the ones that would be instanced - you would not be able to capture. Same would be for, like, maybe an asteroid base that was, you know, not a solo one-off system one.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 35 (2014.08.25)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Uyur8rqbEHc", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Jukebox", "published_at_timestamp": 1409004035}, {"objectID": "373683940", "question": "Now that Arena Commander is out and feedback from players is pouring in, what are you guys taking away from it?I've been reading a lot of the commentary from players, but I am very interested in knowing what you're hearing. Very general question, I know.", "answer": "Well I think a lot of the feedback is what I was talking about at the top of this show which is that most feedback is about the flight model, which I went into depth with, so you hopefully have already had a really good explanation for that.But it sort of told us that we need to do a better job explaining why it's this way, and also in some ways do a better job of tweaking it. 'Cause it's IFCS, it's a complicated system, so it certainly can be more efficient, or be better, or maybe we give it some more modes that allow people a bit more flexibility. It's all things that we're tweaking.And then there's a fair amount of the other big sort of... I don't know whether it's debate on the forums, it's about control methods. So there's a certain amount of \"it's Arcade Commander because you can just point and click the mouse and win.\" I would argue that that's not the case, I actually don't like flying with the mouse.Definitely the mouse does allow you a little more precision in aiming your gimbaled weapons, but there's a couple of modes and stuff that we have for the joystick and the HOTAS, which didn't get implemented for v0.8, that would cancel out some of that.So we're still playing with all that, but from our standpoint, controls and the flight model are all things that we're working on. I think the actual physics of the flight model is brilliant, I think that the IFCS of it all, we can be doing some more fine tuning, and the controls, we're working on.I mean we're gonna be allowing people to do custom key binding, and that's one of the big things we're working on. Hopefully that will be in people's hands in 2-3 weeks or so. And those, I think, are the biggest ones.There's obviously a few little balance things, but we're super early days, and it's great, it's positive with the negative. It's all great 'cause it's really helping us hone in.I know we're not gonna be able to please everybody, 'cause that's just the nature of the beast, especially with so many people, but ultimately I think it's gonna be something really special.

The only way you can go faster than light is going through a jump point which is really a fold in time and space. But that's the fast travel inside the system, then you get pulled out of warp space, .2 speed of light, as you get close to another body or another ship, because at those kind of velocities, there's not way that your ship's computer can make corrections quickly enough to avoid a collision. So as you start to get close to something that there could be collision potential, it pulls you out of that warp speed. You essentially will select these points to jump to.Now of course you could just fly in that direction, and in some cases this is where astrogation and navigation comes into it, more exploring, you can map areas of a system. So there may be areas of a system that aren't mapped, but maybe there's an asteroid field or a derelict spaceship or something, and as you fly around with a long range scanner, you start to map things. As points of interest come in that you would map, that would create a new nav point on your nav computer, and you could send that to your friends, your organization, or potentially you could sell some nav points that you've charted. Think of it very much like in the old days, where they were mapping coasts or a continent, and the old explorers would go around and do cartography to map out the new world.So we've built that in, and that's kind of how the navigation/astrogation will happen.In terms of traveling from one side of the galaxy to the other side, you have to travel in system, go to a jump point, know that the jump point goes to the other system, make the jump, and then in the next system, fly to the next jump point you want to go through, and so on and so on.

I mean unequivocal yes, obviously. So the long term plan is Star Citizen is never going to stop being developed, it's never gonna stop having content added to it, it's never going to stop having functionality added to it. So the way I look at it is even just now everyone having the hangar last year we're gonna have the dogfight in the near future here, and even the early versions of adding the functionality and content our projected path is: We're gonna do the dogfights, the base dogfights where you'll be able to fly around in single seater fighter style stuff. Then we'll have another update that will bring in the multi-crew ships, the bigger ships. Then we'll have some kind of update that will probably involve some first person combat stuff. Then some update that will involve bringing all that together. Then an update involving planet-side. So it's just building the game over time, and we won't change that philosophy even after the game is \"finished.\" Even when you can go around the full Persistent Universe with the initial set of planets because we'll be adding new content and new functionality and we'll also be continually R&Ding new stuff. So ultimately long term I would love to be able to have a way to go seamlessly down onto the planets, maybe have some more procedural generation, have a way to sort of build out stuff. That's all stuff that we're doing R&D on now, not for the initial release, but just to get it in a process, evaluate what the issues are, and we're allowed to do that because you guys have been so generous in backing us. So we have funds to do some long term research and development stuff, and the goal is we aren't gonna stagnate. Just like if you look at the Hornet now, if you look at the Hornet when I did my original presentation on the tech demo. The Hornet has much more detail 'cause we're always constantly refining and updating stuff. That will not stop once we're live. The goal is to make this the most lived in, immersive, detailed, universe possible. And obviously we're not gonna get it all for the first time the persistent universe is active for everyone. So that will just take time afterwards and some of the features that we've gotten on the stretch goals and some of the content won't drop right at the very beginning because it's taking a long time to do all this stuff, but it will always go in. So hopefully you'll feel things are always moving forward and there's new stuff coming in. Especially as we're scaling the team, which we're still doing, that will all snowball. So this year you'll definitely see a lot more stuff than you saw last year and I think after that it will be more.

If so, how does that affect the g-force system you spoke about for dogfighting?", "answer": "So not all ships will have artificial gravity, most of the bigger ones where you walk around probably will have artificial gravity. I'm sort of playing with the idea that maybe on some ones you would just have more magnetic boots because we are actually modeling for our first person combat artificial gravity and zero-g combat so we're going to have all those options and one of the things that potentially you could be something that would be fun would be to disrupt borders would be to disable your artificial gravity and all this sudden you're in zero-g. How it affects g-forces, well I mean really not so much. You know, pilots fly around here on earth and they're experiencing the gravity of earth, yet they still deal with g's as they pull tight turns, and the same would definitely be true in space if you have artificial gravity in your ship and you start to really pull a really hard right turn you will, since you're not statically bound to the object that's turning right, there will be an equal and opposite force on you and you'll be getting pushed, and so you'll probably still have some level, I mean you'll still have obviously g-forces even when there's artificial gravity, but generally the other thing to I think remember is the bigger ships that you would more likely have the artificial gravity. So for instance the Hornet doesn't really have artificial gravity cause you're strapped in, but the bigger ships, you probably won't be able to pull as hard of maneuvers as you would necessarily in say some of the smaller ships, which is again part of the trade-off/balance between big ships small ships. Big ships have more armor, more weapons, but then again they can't move quite as quickly and all the rest of the stuff, so I hope that answers your question.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 05 (2014.01.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/RtyZzO5OrE0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Holo-san Voidrax", "published_at_timestamp": 1389982600}, {"objectID": "f6c403634b4d5_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "There are lots of popular space settings out there -- what are your favorite aspects of some of them that you admire and want to draw inspiration from?", "answer": "I assume you mean TV, movies and books?
