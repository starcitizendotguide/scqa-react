What the hell happened?", "answer": "Time is relative, no. So a few things on that. First is when I said that, first off, I do regret using that exact terminology. But to be more serious, when I said that, that doesn't mean we're really close to going live, right? So I think that's one thing to consider is that there's still the whole Avocado PTU live flow that we have to go through. And there's going to be a lead time to getting that out to players no matter what. So it wasn't like we were so close to just pushing the button and being live. I probably could have been clearer on that point.<br/><br/>But on top of all that, there's a lot of things that happen even still in between what we would normally go to live and doing for the development. And in particular, some things that ended up being especially problematic going long was things in particular like ATC in transit. ATC and transit were two really critical parts of the whole hangar loop, of course, and the ship loading changes that we did with the ship loading platform. And unfortunately, if you could ask me to pick two systems to not touch at all, it would be ATC in transit because they're two older systems in the game. They're very complicated and they have lots of bugs historically. They're problem children for us as systems.<br/><br/>So we knew coming into this that it was going to be a risk making changes to those systems. And what turned out to be, I think, more of a problem than we anticipated is that once we started getting wider testing, those systems really buckled underneath load in a way that we weren't really seeing internally. So if anybody was on the PTU, for example, whenever we first started going out, it would be rocky. We'd put out some fixes, bring in more players, and then the thing would fall over. And as a developer, to make it more frustrating, fall over in a way where not only could we not reproduce but our own QA oftentimes couldn't easily reproduce it. Or if they could, there wasn't a coherent understanding about what the fundamental cause was.<br/><br/>So for those kinds of issues, we had to get creative as far as understanding what was happening and what to do to address it because again, we couldn't really consistently or fully understand it. So we put in a lot of diagnostics, a lot of telemetry, try things, and then eventually work towards a conclusion on what the actual fundamental problems were. On top of that, I think there was kind of a consideration with those systems about, right, we're gonna go in here, we're gonna make some big changes. We know we have to in order to make all of this hangar stuff work. But these are kind of older systems. Do we rewrite them? Do we largely refactor them or do we try to keep them largely intact but with the smaller changes that we need, hopefully smaller changes that we need to get us out?<br/><br/>We wanted to hit the release date sooner. So we made the call that we were not going to largely refactor or rewrite them for this release. In retrospect, I'm not sure, like if I could do it again, I would be interested to know, would it be longer actually if we just decided to just rewrite or refactor them first? The good news is that we already are planning on doing just that. And in fact, transit is already in progress with the new version, which needed to happen anyways for server mashing and all this stuff. So that's good. And then ATC as well, we already have plans on how to rework it and to make it just fundamentally some of the problems at play here because ATC as a system is so like centralized and it keeps a lot of state internally in a very centralized place.<br/><br/>But these systems are extremely complicated about how they deal with persistence and logging and streaming. And in particular, tracking ship allocations in the hangars. So we would get bugs, for example, with like ships doubling up in hangars, et cetera. Like those things were really challenging the system as well as like the doors not opening. So like a lot of that stuff, I think we have a lot better idea about what to do about it as a system in the future. But this release, we made the call to try to take the system that we had, just kind of like get it working with the new direction and then hopefully give us some more time without so much time pressure to make the right adjustments like more fundamentally.<br/><br/>It's a risk we took. It didn't turn out I think as we hoped, but sometimes that's how it goes. But there was a lot more things than that. Another thing was the mission system. It's a new mission system with a new delivery hookup for the delivery missions, first outing, right? There's a lot of new shaky things that we found with in particular the hookup from the freight elevators to the missions. There's just like a lot of loose ends, a lot of things threads would get lost. We have this whole warehouse system that has to interact with the mission system. And there was just, again, a lot of these like rare low repro issues that in these very fundamental places, actually, this is another point for ATC in transit.<br/><br/>Like when you have a moderate inconsistent bug in a system that's not as critical, it doesn't seem as bad. Not to say that bugs aren't bad. Of course, we want the game to be stable. But whenever you have something that's like, let's say it happens 1% of the time or 0.1% of the time. Unfortunately, if that isn't a part of the game flow, that's critical. It's unplayable, right? So we have to like take even more care with those systems to get them into a better place. So the game is more playable because those bugs have an outsized effect.<br/><br/>But beyond that, there's also in particular, a lot of issues that we had with networking and serialization and the replication layer changes that were coming in preparation for server meshing. And I can just speak from my own personal experience, debugging some of these things. There was some very complicated, hard to understand bugs that we had to work back to eventually being actually corruption in serialized data that was coming from some bugs in the replication layer, which we could not reproduce that again internally. And that was a wild one to figure out. It was very, very confusing as you can imagine, because it's rare and it's random and like the data you get doesn't make sense and you try to make sense of like how these things come together. But we got there.<br/><br/>There were design and iteration changes. Some of them, we were pretty public about like the item bank, but also tweaks to the freight elevator kiosk, changes to how the economy tuning works, for example, auto loading times and stuff. So like, and to be fair, we were wanting the patch to be a complete package as much as we could. So given that we were already going late, we didn't entirely shy away from taking some of the time to like also like clean things up on the design side while we're also grappling with some of these harder engineering problems.<br/><br/>And then like the final thing I'll say on it is we didn't want the whole schedule to shift. So we still have a lot of other goals. One of them obviously was the Atlas, but there's things coming up 4.0. We're obviously still trying to get Squadron finished and out the door. And we didn't wanna just take everything and just like take everyone, focus entirely on this release, get this release out the door and have our whole schedule change for the whole company. So we had to like keep, there was a lot of people who needed to move on to 4.0 goals or whatever. And so it meant that we needed to keep the core people that were working on the main line features on the release, but we didn't have the full force of the company to just close that one specific patch out. We could have, but like I said, it would have caused problems for our other goals otherwise.<br/><br/>So you kind of in total, there's a lot of things that I feel like I've learned from and I hope in the future, it gives us a better like framework for how to deal with something this complex.<br/><br/> Yeah, one last thing I'll say is: I think there was also just a fundamental problem with the whole conceit of having this many fundamental things in one patch, where I think if I would do it again, I would slice it differently and try to do the persistent and instance hangars in their own patch first and then layer on top all this other stuff. We wanted them to come together as an experience. And I understand that might have been actually kind of a weird thing for the players to go through to have like this one particular aspect of that feature set come in without the things that make sense. But from a development perspective, it would have allowed us to harden on the aspects of it that were in particular thorny and more of an engineering challenge and then get that hardened and stable so that we give that to the players and then layer on top of that all this other stuff around it. But doing it all together, I think really challenged us when some of the, like I said, some of the risks didn't break in our favor.", "title": " Star Citizen Live: Cargo & Hangars ", "source": "https://youtu.be/3a6av7BoNTw", "type": "youtube", "published_at_timestamp": 1726228800}, {"objectID": "116fcda80bf0c8_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "There is no bed on board, but the seats are pretty comfy\u2026", "published_at_timestamp": 1685052000, "question": "The Lynx has a luxurious interior for meetings and short excursions.

In relation to this, they're reworking the HUD, Multi-Function Displays, and the FPS visor. Jared posits that one of the reasons people want to be able to change the HUD colour is because it can be difficult to read at times, so being able to change the colour could help with that, but also sometimes people just like different colours, or it could even be related to colour blindness. He continues by saying that it's important to get the basic building blocks of UI done first, before they implement customisation. Zane talks about how they're moving away from having static UI building blocks, to much more flexible ones that should help in solving UI issues. Regarding changing colours to make things easier to read, Zane suggests that there might be a solution to that problem that goes beyond UI (this gets talked about later). Jared reiterates that whilst they're still in development, they want to make the best default standard UI possible, which requires everyone to be using the same thing so that the feedback is unified rather than skewered, because otherwise the feedback would be in regards to specific customisations that would be hard to follow (because there'd be so many different setups).

Our attitude is that we\u2019re going for quality.<br /><br />The only worry that I have is losing the support of the community. That\u2019s what\u2019s enabling us to make the game that we\u2019re making right now. As long as we have the support of the community, I have no doubt that we will make this amazing game. Now whether that\u2019s the amazing game that everyone out there wants, I can\u2019t say. Everyone has their own particular vision of what they think is the thing they need. But I will say I have a pretty good feeling that what we will deliver will satisfy and impress a good amount of people. I really believe it. We\u2019re basically combining a lot of the things you\u2019ve never had in one game before. It\u2019s going to take us longer to get to that nirvana of it all, but I think it will be something very special.<br /><br />People can complain about dates and timelines, but what they really want is a great experience. We\u2019re not doing just a single player game. We have this open-world universe, that you can venture around in for years to come. You don\u2019t want to cut corners \u2014 you want to build it right. Something that\u2019ll last for a long time \u2014 that\u2019s my goal. I\u2019m not looking at this game like I\u2019m going to finish it and then move on to the next game. This is it. This is going to be a living product, a living world. It will evolve with content, features, graphical capabilities. It will be a constantly living product getting bigger, better and richer over the years. When you do that, you need to make sure the foundation is right.", "title": "Meet the Man Behind \u2018Star Citizen,\u2019 the Most Ambitious Video Game Ever", "source": "https://gearpatrol.com/2016/10/06/interview-chris-roberts-star-citizen-creator/", "type": "article", "user": "Michael Finn", "published_at_timestamp": 1475712000}, {"objectID": "373672240", "question": "In 3.0 demo, they picked up a crate, can you pick up any \u2018there\u2019s a mouse on the table, can I pick it up?

They had a system, Grabby Hands, they worked and polished for a while. They were faking it where you do a little \u2018swipe\u2019 that as you swiped it would attach and blend into the hand. Could walk around, set it down on a box, then pick up the box, etc\u2026<br /><br />2.0 version of that is a looting system. It\u2019s got more defined metrics. Before, if you picked up a pistol, there was a little animation that\u2019d fake getting it into your hand correctly. With the new looting system, you have one handed and two handed pickups, where you can come in and pick up an object of a certain size. There\u2019s some fudging, but they want to stay within the metrics for it all. There\u2019s right handed and left handed, there\u2019s things for holding a datapad in your hand, which is different from grabbing a coffee or whatnot. They\u2019ve already established lots of metrics for useables in the universe; consoles, doors, railings, etc\u2026 but they\u2019re also starting to get into the realm of metric\u2019d props that you pick up and carry around. After CitCon, Bryan is now the metric guru, he\u2019ll be going through and grabbing objects, saying every object within a certain class, he\u2019ll put it in hands, they\u2019ll make stuff look good, and they\u2019ll create a node inside the object so every object, when you pick it up, it\u2019ll have an animation where he goes down and picks it up, and he\u2019ll have it in his hand. In the hand, you can inspect the object.<br /><br />If you wanted to put on a helmet; You\u2019ll grab it, look at it, you can examine or inspect, if you want to buy it you can look around at it and look at the stats. Then you could purchase it. But you say, I want the object, whether you got it off a dead soldier or whatnot. I want this guy\u2019s helmet. Now you can walk around with it, put it under your arm and walk around, and then when you\u2019re ready to drop or equip, you can go back and examine it, then you can drop it, equip it, whatever.

It's been interesting because that's one of the things that was really fascinating about Fallout 4 was I didn't realise they had done the whole \"name recording\" thing and I had ended up picking a name the robot knew so it actually referred to me by name and it totally blew my mind. That being said it's a really, really complicated technical thing to accomplish because invariably it feels like you have to do so many voice recordings and so many variables and stuff that people will always feel left out because you're not going to get everyone's name, it's just not a feasible reality.Matt Sherman: But now more to a player's actions I can definite see us getting something where, at least based on your reputation, you could have something where you're the \"Hero of the UEE\" and when you are walking around people might, at least, act a little bit better towards you.DH: Yeah, I guess it becomes a little bit more strategic. Or how we frame it. The classic example is you are the one who killed the Dread Pirate Roberts, you might be walking down the street someone might go \"oh, that's ... they killed ... that's the one ... that's the guy/girl that killed Dread Pirate Roberts\" because then you only have two options that you need to record or whatever. But then it feels like the universe is dynamically reacting to the stuff that you've done. So, yeah I think so. It's definitely going to be seeded into the Reputation system and that's one of the things that's been a heavily discussed thing of late, of trying to figure out exactly how deep the Reputation system goes and how it works and stuff like that.MS: So seeding your actions into their responses that can possibly happen but doing it by character name is going to, most likely, be a bit prohibitive.DH: Yeah.", "published_at_timestamp": 1451344698, "question": "My question about the Narrative/Story in the PU is about playable characters inclusion in the universe.

The mechanics... with people having various packages, so a character would come with a package, they would come with the various... whatever type of hangar. We haven't fully worked out the dynamics but I think the intention was especially... I think we've already talked about this is to allow someone that has backed us to the extent that they have that much stuff, thank you very much by the way Doc Tari. We would allow you to maybe sort of split that around different places in the universe. In terms of the mechanics and how it works, it would be hard to say right now, maybe you would have the ability or a chit to start in a couple places and you can pick them. Maybe you decide not to turn the chit in and perhaps when you come into a certain place you say, 'oh, I'd like to have a hangar here'. Then because you still have a hangar credit you can basically turn that in for a hangar at that location. That is to be worked out long term but at first we want to get the hangar connected to the local environment, connected to the space and flying around. So, I would say that you probably will be able to assign them to different landing zones and systems in the PU. You may have to travel to those systems first to do that or you have your starting location in a few places and you could maybe pick a couple places you could have your zones.

Arma 3 is interesting in that it's more realism based, we're trending towards that. We're taking elements from all of them and going for more a slightly slower paced game, you don't respawn instantly, if you get shot your friend might drag you back and heal you with a stimpak etc. The combat itself is potentially more lethal, it might be that you die and then you're out for that session. I think we'll have the battlefield feel of how your weapons and movement work, but with an influence from say rainbow 6 and arma in realism, but not too far, just an idea where we have trade-offs, like people might not want a helmet/view restrictions, so they can wear less armour, but while you might see more or move faster you're more susceptible to damage etc. You might get out of breath quicker in heavy armour etc, all of these things will be resource management while you fight, which differs ours from some of the faster FPSs like COD, Halo or destiny (although destiny has good weapon management). So we just need to balance it between realism and sci-fi fun, somewhere between battlefields/destinies to arma style with some extra elements like zero-g stuff and varied weapons.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 59 (2015.04.06)", "source": "https://youtu.be/OXpx2C6rFAc", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "DataTransfer", "published_at_timestamp": 1428360934}, {"objectID": "373677560", "question": "How do you forsee snub fighters being deployed on capital ships?

Some like the Constellation you could fly by yourself or you could fly with friends you can custom distribute these tasks if you need to, but on the very big ships there will be designated stations like engineering, or weapons, or helm, comms officer etc. We're definitely making it so that the multi crew ship's functions will be split if needed, and you'll be more effective if these responsibilities are handled by friends or NPCs because then you can multitask on a different level. It's actually one of the things I'm most excited about in the PU, I mean AC is cool and higher fidelity than I've implemented before, but really when you're able to fly around with friends manning various parts of the ship and you can go wherever you want, like EVA around the ship, board another ship, walk around planetside etc. So I feel like the co-operative play aspect will be really strong, which we emphasise in these Multi-crew ships, which I think is the most fun in PVE or PVP situations.", "title": "10 For the Chairman: Episode 45 (2014.11.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/qXwybQaAbbs", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "FortyEight", "published_at_timestamp": 1416257116}, {"objectID": "373678370", "question": "Will there be \"variants\" of the mobiGlas interface for our characters, complete with upgrades and options?", "answer": "Yes, the idea with the mobiGlas is to think of it like Android or iOS, you'll have different apps to load onto it, and even the device itself will be made by different manufacturers.

Whether or not you will be able to entirely avoid flying in space, I probably doubt that would be the case. But you certainly could join crews and operate as a boarding party specialist and not be flying, say on a bigger multi-crew ship. There will definitely be some FPS encounters that will be down on planet-side that will allow it. So I would say that if you prefer to do FPS, there will be that available for you to do in the game. And we're also going to be creating a sort of FPS... you know, we have Arena Commander - there's gonna be some of the FPS extension to that to allow you to practice your FPS skills without having to risk getting killed for real in space.

We're still trying to figure out what we'll do for the bigger ship, one of the things we've talked about is having them in an orbit and then you take a shuttle down to the surface.So you'll certainly be able to hang out on the ships you've got, but maybe instead of being in the hangar, you're in orbit, and you look out of the windows and there's space and the planet you're around outside it.

I mean high latency obviously effects any stuff, and packet loss, we definitely will be going back and forth with a lot of data because the ships are pretty heavy data-wise, they have lots of moving parts. So that potentially could be an issue, but that's sort of the stuff we want to be working on and testing out. That's the whole part of the Dogfighting Module and also why we want to have the final MMO back-end, at least a rudimentary version of it, working for the dogfighting. There are advantages to the space sim part of Star Citizen or Squadron 42 in terms of multiplayer net-code compared to an on-foot first person shooter. Now of course we do have an on-foot first person section, so that will have the same problems that you have in Call of Duty or something. But basically when you fly a ship, you can't--the problem with a first person shooter is I can be here and then I can step here then step here. So basically the movements of your avatar can be fairly random and not very easy to predict. Whereas in a ship you can't do that, you've got to turn.
