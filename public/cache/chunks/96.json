[{"objectID": "bmGyM6NED9-airpra", "answer": "The Artificial Intelligence Research and Production Restriction Act (AIRPRA) is a piece of legislation that places strict rules governing research on true artificial intelligence (AI) in the United Empire of Earth(UEE). Popularly referred to as \"the AI ban,\" it originated after the disappearance of the Artemis, a long-haul colony ship containing thousands of individuals in cryogenic storage. The AI that had been designed to monitor and pilot the ship was blamed, and politicians latched onto the restriction of AI research as a wedge issue to secure votes. Many countries went on to ban artificial intelligence over the next few decades. When the United Nations of Earth (UNE) was created in 2380, its architects included AI restrictions in its earliest laws. The United Planets of Earth (UPE) and the UEE kept AIRPRA in place during their formations, and it remains the law of the land. </p><br/><h1>OVERVIEW</h1><br/><p>AIRPRA grants the Senate the authority to review and approve or deny all artificial intelligence research, commercial and non commercial. It defines artificial intelligence as \"any software or hardware that can convincingly imitate intelligent Human behavior.\" This broad definition places severe limits on any kind of research that can be done in the AI field, and has effectively banned its production and use throughout the UEE. Specific guidelines include: </p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u2022 A ban on the reception of government funding for AI research.</p><br/><p>\u2022 A requirement for Senate approval on privately funded artificial intelligence research.</p><br/><p>\u2022 If approved, the research must be strictly supervised by the UEE Science and Technology Committee.</p><br/><p>\u2022 A notice that approval can be revoked at any time.</p><br/><p>\u2022 A ban on selling any product that displays signs of artificial intelligence.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Any person found in violation of AIRPRA is subject to arrest and may be sentenced to imprisonment for 15 to 20 years. Corporations and research institutions found to be knowingly abetting AI research are subject to a sliding scale of fines and are subject to asset seizure. </p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>In 2043, the Eakara Company launched a line of self-driving cars powered by what they claimed to be the first true AI. This differed from earlier products marketed as AI, which were deep generative models that could mimic the qualities of Human intelligence but did not truly possess it. This new AI, Eakara promised, had the intelligence, good judgment, and fast reaction time of the most seasoned Human drivers. The city of Tokyo was an early investor, and purchased a fleet of cars and buses to bulk up their transportation infrastructure in areas too distant from train stations to be easily reached on foot. </p><br/><p>In 2044, while driving on a road on a high cliff, one of the Eakara buses made a wrong turn and plummeted over the edge to the sea below, resulting in 21 deaths. Fifteen minutes later, another bus followed, this one with 37 passengers aboard. Authorities contacted Eakara and the company's technicians sent out an emergency command to force all self-driving vehicles in Tokyo and its outskirts to immediately stop without finishing their current trips. Vehicles not engaged in active trips stopped as commanded, but those that were transporting passengers at the time ignored the command continued their trips to completion. Although the vast majority did this without incident, three more buses and 18 cars suffered fatal accidents before all vehicles in the fleet ended their trips and finally stopped moving. 113 people in total died. This became known as the \"Lemming Car Incident,\" and resulted in the dissolution of the Eakara Company. The nation of Japan banned the use of AI in self-driving cars, but similar bans would not be enacted elsewhere until deadly incidents caused by cars from other companies occurred in New York in 2044 and Johannesburg in 2047. </p><br/><p>With public distrust in AI high and investors unwilling to back AI-led ventures, researchers began to focus on its application in the sciences rather than day to day life. In 2055, an AI helped to identify a type of bacteria commonly found in the digestive systems of apex carnivores that was utilized to prevent prion diseases. Another AI helped synthesize a cure for rabies. One especially advanced AI was put in charge of calculating the spacecraft trajectories that ensured early missions to Mars were successful. These triumphs helped thaw public opinion and paved the way for AI usage in early terraforming platforms used on Mars. </p><br/><p>Designed to complete quick calculations and enact minute adjustments to the atmosphere, the Mars AI was notable for its ability to provide imaginative solutions to complex issues at a speed much higher than that of a Human and with a significantly lower margin of error. At the time, the team in charge of terraforming Mars credited the AI for the ease with which the project appeared to be progressing. However, on 13 September 2125, a miscalculation that was later linked to the AI led to the sudden catastrophic dissipation of the near-complete atmosphere, resulting in the deaths of over 4800 people. This event, deemed the \"Mars Tragedy\" in the press, again destroyed positive public opinion about AI and halted most ongoing development. </p><br/><p>In 2201, AI researcher Dr. Carol Zahir secured funding from private sources and began crafting a new type of artificial intelligence that she would name Janus. By far the most advanced AI of its time, Janus could hold conversations, draw conclusions, and make educated guesses at or beyond the level of a Human. In 2228, Roberts Space Industries (RSI) began construction of the Artemis, a long-haul colony ship that would rely on quantum travel to reach the potentially habitable planetary system codenamed GJ 667Cc. Zahir reached out to the company and proposed that Janus serve as the nerve center of the ship. Given that it would take over 200 years for the ship to reach its destination, RSI agreed. This would allow all the colonists and crew aboard to remain safely in cryogenic sleep without forcing any one of them to grow old and die while they oversaw the journey. </p><br/><p>The <em>Artemis</em> launched in 2232 to great fanfare. Soon after it was determined to be safely on course, its launch crew entered cryosleep, leaving Janus solely in charge. Janus transmitted regular reports to Earth until 2237, when any communications from it abruptly ceased. Mission control repeatedly hailed it, but Janus either refused to or could not respond. RSI and multiple governments launched extensive searches, but the <em>Artemis</em> was nowhere to be found. It seemed to have disappeared without a trace. </p><br/><p>The outcry that resulted from the loss of over 5000 people was enormous. Although it was not certain that Janus had anything to do with the disappearance of the <em>Artemis</em>, the media vocally blamed it for the catastrophe, citing the Lemming Car Incident and the Mars Tragedy as evidence. Politicians on Earth and Mars latched onto the ban of artificial intelligence as a wedge issue, using it as a springboard to secure votes and take office. As promised in hundreds of campaign speeches, they enacted a wave of bans and halted and confiscated any AI research in their jurisdiction. When the United Nations of Earth eventually formed in 2380, distrust of AI was still high enough that the Artificial Intelligence Research and Production Restriction Act (AIRPRA) became one of the newly-created government's earliest proposed laws. The Senate approved it in a landslide vote.</p><br/><h1>CRITICISM</h1><br/><p>Because the definition of AI under AIRPRA is so broad, critics have pointed out that it has been used to stifle research and technology that is only tangentially related to AI, such as more efficient autopilots for spacecraft and companies that sell interactive toys. It has also been argued that the secrecy around AI has allowed the government to conduct dangerous research of its own away from the scrutiny of the public, as revealed with the declassification of Project Overlord in 2943. </p><br/><p>Imperator Laylani Addision promised to loosen restrictions on AI research during her election campaign, stating that \"...the goal of technology should always be to help Humanity, not replace it. AI included,\" in an interview on the popular spectrum show Clean Shot. Her Innovation Initiative, launched soon after she took office in 2951, allows the issuance of special waivers to research institutions pursuing the study of AI. Any institution that receives this waiver is eligible for a limited number of government grants, and must make all advancements resulting from their research both public and free for all to use.

Their first thought is that it's because the current UI isn't working for people, so then they'd need to know what people don't like. In relation to this, they're reworking the HUD, Multi-Function Displays, and the FPS visor. Jared posits that one of the reasons people want to be able to change the HUD colour is because it can be difficult to read at times, so being able to change the colour could help with that, but also sometimes people just like different colours, or it could even be related to colour blindness. He continues by saying that it's important to get the basic building blocks of UI done first, before they implement customisation. Zane talks about how they're moving away from having static UI building blocks, to much more flexible ones that should help in solving UI issues. Regarding changing colours to make things easier to read, Zane suggests that there might be a solution to that problem that goes beyond UI (this gets talked about later). Jared reiterates that whilst they're still in development, they want to make the best default standard UI possible, which requires everyone to be using the same thing so that the feedback is unified rather than skewered, because otherwise the feedback would be in regards to specific customisations that would be hard to follow (because there'd be so many different setups).

The plan is to support slaved turrets in general - and the Hurricane's turret will be no exception.

Up to this point, we've integrated some of the remote turrets on the current list of flight-ready ships on case by case basis so far, but the long-term preference is to establish a consistent systemic solution to remote turret integration rather than simply accommodating the various edge cases one ship hardpoint at a time. Overall, a lone pilot will not be totally kneecapped if their gunner decides to take the day off, but solo operating a ship designed for multiple crewmen would need to consider a loadout adjustment, and avionics would be part of that decision.", "published_at": "2017-03-01", "published_at_timestamp": 1488322800, "question": "Can the turret be slaved like the Super Hornet?", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/15765-Q-A-Anvil-Hurricane-Part-I", "title": "Q&A: Anvil Hurricane - Part I", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "1244023091", "question": "Star Citizen is a massively ambitious video game, relying totally on the support of fans\u2019 crowdfunded dollars.

What do you say to these skeptics?", "answer": "I\u2019m building the game that I wanted to build. There\u2019s been a vast amount of long hours and assets just to get it here, and there\u2019s still going to be a lot more long hours and assets to get it online. But I\u2019m building it because it\u2019s something that I want to play. I have no doubt in every fiber of my being that we will deliver the game that I see in my head and the game that I think will be really great, and I think my team is like-minded. In any endeavor, there\u2019s always people who say, \u201cIt\u2019s too ambitious. You won\u2019t make it.\u201d But there\u2019s a Chinese proverb: Those who think it can\u2019t be done should get out of the way of those who are doing it. I very much ascribe to that.<br /><br />If you take a look and see what we\u2019ve shared over the years and the progress we\u2019ve made, there\u2019s a lot of things people said we couldn\u2019t do that we are doing right now. We are doing some things on a scale and scope and complexity that no other game has achieved. Yes, we aren\u2019t finished yet, and we have a lot more stuff to do. But for me, that\u2019s more just a matter of time. Are we always going to be on time, are we always going to make dates? No. In all software development I\u2019ve been a part of, it never happens that way. Our attitude is that we\u2019re going for quality.<br /><br />The only worry that I have is losing the support of the community. That\u2019s what\u2019s enabling us to make the game that we\u2019re making right now. As long as we have the support of the community, I have no doubt that we will make this amazing game. Now whether that\u2019s the amazing game that everyone out there wants, I can\u2019t say. Everyone has their own particular vision of what they think is the thing they need. But I will say I have a pretty good feeling that what we will deliver will satisfy and impress a good amount of people. I really believe it. We\u2019re basically combining a lot of the things you\u2019ve never had in one game before. It\u2019s going to take us longer to get to that nirvana of it all, but I think it will be something very special.<br /><br />People can complain about dates and timelines, but what they really want is a great experience. We\u2019re not doing just a single player game. We have this open-world universe, that you can venture around in for years to come.

Could walk around, set it down on a box, then pick up the box, etc\u2026<br /><br />2.0 version of that is a looting system. It\u2019s got more defined metrics. Before, if you picked up a pistol, there was a little animation that\u2019d fake getting it into your hand correctly. With the new looting system, you have one handed and two handed pickups, where you can come in and pick up an object of a certain size. There\u2019s some fudging, but they want to stay within the metrics for it all. There\u2019s right handed and left handed, there\u2019s things for holding a datapad in your hand, which is different from grabbing a coffee or whatnot.

After CitCon, Bryan is now the metric guru, he\u2019ll be going through and grabbing objects, saying every object within a certain class, he\u2019ll put it in hands, they\u2019ll make stuff look good, and they\u2019ll create a node inside the object so every object, when you pick it up, it\u2019ll have an animation where he goes down and picks it up, and he\u2019ll have it in his hand.

Then you could purchase it. But you say, I want the object, whether you got it off a dead soldier or whatnot. I want this guy\u2019s helmet.

I think we've already talked about this is to allow someone that has backed us to the extent that they have that much stuff, thank you very much by the way Doc Tari. We would allow you to maybe sort of split that around different places in the universe.

Arma 3 is interesting in that it's more realism based, we're trending towards that. We're taking elements from all of them and going for more a slightly slower paced game, you don't respawn instantly, if you get shot your friend might drag you back and heal you with a stimpak etc. The combat itself is potentially more lethal, it might be that you die and then you're out for that session. I think we'll have the battlefield feel of how your weapons and movement work, but with an influence from say rainbow 6 and arma in realism, but not too far, just an idea where we have trade-offs, like people might not want a helmet/view restrictions, so they can wear less armour, but while you might see more or move faster you're more susceptible to damage etc. You might get out of breath quicker in heavy armour etc, all of these things will be resource management while you fight, which differs ours from some of the faster FPSs like COD, Halo or destiny (although destiny has good weapon management).

It's not so much just about the snub-fighters, this all applies to the proper fighters as well, like the hornet and the gadius etc.", "published_at": "2014-12-15", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 48 (2014.12.15)", "source": "https://youtu.be/znxm9bFAH5Q", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Pendulum Effect", "published_at_timestamp": 1418684434}, {"objectID": "373678000", "question": "I have noticed in a lot of the multiple crew ships that they all have a co-pilot seat and numerous turret gunner seats. What can we expect the co-pilot to be able to do while in or out of combat? Will they have systems to manage and weapons to operate, or will they wait for the pilot to become incapacitated?", "answer": "The idea on multi-crew ships is that different seats allow you to spilt up the functions, so obviously in a single seater you're flying it as well as managing weapons, as well as the radar, as well as communications (not yet, but will be) and power etc etc. So on the bigger multi-crew ships we're allowing you to spilt that responsibility to other seats. Some like the Constellation you could fly by yourself or you could fly with friends you can custom distribute these tasks if you need to, but on the very big ships there will be designated stations like engineering, or weapons, or helm, comms officer etc. We're definitely making it so that the multi crew ship's functions will be split if needed, and you'll be more effective if these responsibilities are handled by friends or NPCs because then you can multitask on a different level. It's actually one of the things I'm most excited about in the PU, I mean AC is cool and higher fidelity than I've implemented before, but really when you're able to fly around with friends manning various parts of the ship and you can go wherever you want, like EVA around the ship, board another ship, walk around planetside etc. So I feel like the co-operative play aspect will be really strong, which we emphasise in these Multi-crew ships, which I think is the most fun in PVE or PVP situations.", "published_at": "2014-11-17", "title": "10 For the Chairman: Episode 45 (2014.11.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/qXwybQaAbbs", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "FortyEight", "published_at_timestamp": 1416257116}, {"objectID": "373678370", "question": "Will there be \"variants\" of the mobiGlas interface for our characters, complete with upgrades and options?", "answer": "Yes, the idea with the mobiGlas is to think of it like Android or iOS, you'll have different apps to load onto it, and even the device itself will be made by different manufacturers. So in SQ42 you'll have a stripped down military one, but in the PU you can get a more full-featured one with higher specs and ability to load apps, and there'll be different skins etc, just like you can do with current Android / iOS / Windows phones.", "published_at": "2014-10-20", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 42 (2014.10.20)", "source": "https://youtu.be/paE5gpEdltI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "NeoOnyx13", "published_at_timestamp": 1413842404}, {"objectID": "373679180", "question": "My question is whether or not it will be possible to play this game as a pure FPS specialist? For instance, what if my character is a terrible pilot and hates flying? Will it be possible to exist planetside, engaging only in FPS encounters? Or to be a passenger flying along only as a boarding party member?", "answer": "So I think there definitely will be the opportunity to focus much more on FPS. Whether or not you will be able to entirely avoid flying in space, I probably doubt that would be the case. But you certainly could join crews and operate as a boarding party specialist and not be flying, say on a bigger multi-crew ship. There will definitely be some FPS encounters that will be down on planet-side that will allow it. So I would say that if you prefer to do FPS, there will be that available for you to do in the game. And we're also going to be creating a sort of FPS... you know, we have Arena Commander - there's gonna be some of the FPS extension to that to allow you to practice your FPS skills without having to risk getting killed for real in space. So watch and stay tuned for that down the road - that's something we'll be talking about later on this year.", "published_at": "2014-08-18", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 34 (2014.08.18)", "source": "https://youtu.be/y4wAP1fWe8c", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Sawbones", "published_at_timestamp": 1408399954}, {"objectID": "373684850", "question": "Hi Chris, what would be the biggest ship that a player can buy (legally) and park in the hangar?An Idris, or could I dream of owning a Javelin and have it safely \"stored\" in my hangar?", "answer": "I don't think you'd be able to buy anything bigger than an Idris that could go in your hangar, and maybe even the Idris may not be able to fit in your hangar. We're still trying to figure out what we'll do for the bigger ship, one of the things we've talked about is having them in an orbit and then you take a shuttle down to the surface.So you'll certainly be able to hang out on the ships you've got, but maybe instead of being in the hangar, you're in orbit, and you look out of the windows and there's space and the planet you're around outside it.

Are the issues presented by packed loss and high latency roughly comparable to a first-person shoorter, or are you expecting this game to be more latency dependent?", "answer": "Packet loss, high latency. I mean high latency obviously effects any stuff, and packet loss, we definitely will be going back and forth with a lot of data because the ships are pretty heavy data-wise, they have lots of moving parts. So that potentially could be an issue, but that's sort of the stuff we want to be working on and testing out. That's the whole part of the Dogfighting Module and also why we want to have the final MMO back-end, at least a rudimentary version of it, working for the dogfighting. There are advantages to the space sim part of Star Citizen or Squadron 42 in terms of multiplayer net-code compared to an on-foot first person shooter. Now of course we do have an on-foot first person section, so that will have the same problems that you have in Call of Duty or something. But basically when you fly a ship, you can't--the problem with a first person shooter is I can be here and then I can step here then step here. So basically the movements of your avatar can be fairly random and not very easy to predict. Whereas in a ship you can't do that, you've got to turn. So essentially in the spaceship scenario you can actually do a much better job of predicting where the player's ship is going to be.
