Their first thought is that it's because the current UI isn't working for people, so then they'd need to know what people don't like. In relation to this, they're reworking the HUD, Multi-Function Displays, and the FPS visor. Jared posits that one of the reasons people want to be able to change the HUD colour is because it can be difficult to read at times, so being able to change the colour could help with that, but also sometimes people just like different colours, or it could even be related to colour blindness. He continues by saying that it's important to get the basic building blocks of UI done first, before they implement customisation. Zane talks about how they're moving away from having static UI building blocks, to much more flexible ones that should help in solving UI issues. Regarding changing colours to make things easier to read, Zane suggests that there might be a solution to that problem that goes beyond UI (this gets talked about later). Jared reiterates that whilst they're still in development, they want to make the best default standard UI possible, which requires everyone to be using the same thing so that the feedback is unified rather than skewered, because otherwise the feedback would be in regards to specific customisations that would be hard to follow (because there'd be so many different setups).

Up to this point, we've integrated some of the remote turrets on the current list of flight-ready ships on case by case basis so far, but the long-term preference is to establish a consistent systemic solution to remote turret integration rather than simply accommodating the various edge cases one ship hardpoint at a time.

It's been interesting because that's one of the things that was really fascinating about Fallout 4 was I didn't realise they had done the whole \"name recording\" thing and I had ended up picking a name the robot knew so it actually referred to me by name and it totally blew my mind. That being said it's a really, really complicated technical thing to accomplish because invariably it feels like you have to do so many voice recordings and so many variables and stuff that people will always feel left out because you're not going to get everyone's name, it's just not a feasible reality.Matt Sherman: But now more to a player's actions I can definite see us getting something where, at least based on your reputation, you could have something where you're the \"Hero of the UEE\" and when you are walking around people might, at least, act a little bit better towards you.DH: Yeah, I guess it becomes a little bit more strategic. Or how we frame it. The classic example is you are the one who killed the Dread Pirate Roberts, you might be walking down the street someone might go \"oh, that's ... they killed ... that's the one ... that's the guy/girl that killed Dread Pirate Roberts\" because then you only have two options that you need to record or whatever. But then it feels like the universe is dynamically reacting to the stuff that you've done. So, yeah I think so. It's definitely going to be seeded into the Reputation system and that's one of the things that's been a heavily discussed thing of late, of trying to figure out exactly how deep the Reputation system goes and how it works and stuff like that.MS: So seeding your actions into their responses that can possibly happen but doing it by character name is going to, most likely, be a bit prohibitive.DH: Yeah.", "published_at_timestamp": 1451344698, "question": "My question about the Narrative/Story in the PU is about playable characters inclusion in the universe.

You want your Millennium Falcon but you've done all these things with and has a history.I think that you know we'll let you name it and do some other stuff and I don't know what necessarily they'll be other incentives to keep the hull but I think potentially longer term we can have aspects where you sort of wear it in and get to know sort of the boundaries or edges of your equipment and we're definitely going to do that on the components where you'll know which ones you can overclock or not overclock and stuff like that.You set it up a certain specific way and so turning and getting a new ship setup will take a little bit of time and investment so a lot of times when you got a ship you got it setup you want to keep it that way and won't necessarily want to lose it because you'll have to set a new one up the same way and it'll just take a bit of time to dial it in so to speak, so there you go on that one!", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 69", "source": "https://youtu.be/AiTY_K7bDys", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "HeroicFrog", "published_at_timestamp": 1447110918}, {"objectID": "373681150", "question": "I have packages and ships that currently total up to 3 VFG Industrial hangars and 4 Selfland hangars.

The mechanics... with people having various packages, so a character would come with a package, they would come with the various... whatever type of hangar. We haven't fully worked out the dynamics but I think the intention was especially... I think we've already talked about this is to allow someone that has backed us to the extent that they have that much stuff, thank you very much by the way Doc Tari. We would allow you to maybe sort of split that around different places in the universe. In terms of the mechanics and how it works, it would be hard to say right now, maybe you would have the ability or a chit to start in a couple places and you can pick them. Maybe you decide not to turn the chit in and perhaps when you come into a certain place you say, 'oh, I'd like to have a hangar here'. Then because you still have a hangar credit you can basically turn that in for a hangar at that location. That is to be worked out long term but at first we want to get the hangar connected to the local environment, connected to the space and flying around. So, I would say that you probably will be able to assign them to different landing zones and systems in the PU. You may have to travel to those systems first to do that or you have your starting location in a few places and you could maybe pick a couple places you could have your zones.

Arma 3 is interesting in that it's more realism based, we're trending towards that. We're taking elements from all of them and going for more a slightly slower paced game, you don't respawn instantly, if you get shot your friend might drag you back and heal you with a stimpak etc. The combat itself is potentially more lethal, it might be that you die and then you're out for that session. I think we'll have the battlefield feel of how your weapons and movement work, but with an influence from say rainbow 6 and arma in realism, but not too far, just an idea where we have trade-offs, like people might not want a helmet/view restrictions, so they can wear less armour, but while you might see more or move faster you're more susceptible to damage etc. You might get out of breath quicker in heavy armour etc, all of these things will be resource management while you fight, which differs ours from some of the faster FPSs like COD, Halo or destiny (although destiny has good weapon management). So we just need to balance it between realism and sci-fi fun, somewhere between battlefields/destinies to arma style with some extra elements like zero-g stuff and varied weapons.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 59 (2015.04.06)", "source": "https://youtu.be/OXpx2C6rFAc", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "DataTransfer", "published_at_timestamp": 1428360934}, {"objectID": "373677560", "question": "How do you forsee snub fighters being deployed on capital ships?

Some like the Constellation you could fly by yourself or you could fly with friends you can custom distribute these tasks if you need to, but on the very big ships there will be designated stations like engineering, or weapons, or helm, comms officer etc. We're definitely making it so that the multi crew ship's functions will be split if needed, and you'll be more effective if these responsibilities are handled by friends or NPCs because then you can multitask on a different level. It's actually one of the things I'm most excited about in the PU, I mean AC is cool and higher fidelity than I've implemented before, but really when you're able to fly around with friends manning various parts of the ship and you can go wherever you want, like EVA around the ship, board another ship, walk around planetside etc. So I feel like the co-operative play aspect will be really strong, which we emphasise in these Multi-crew ships, which I think is the most fun in PVE or PVP situations.", "title": "10 For the Chairman: Episode 45 (2014.11.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/qXwybQaAbbs", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "FortyEight", "published_at_timestamp": 1416257116}, {"objectID": "373678370", "question": "Will there be \"variants\" of the mobiGlas interface for our characters, complete with upgrades and options?", "answer": "Yes, the idea with the mobiGlas is to think of it like Android or iOS, you'll have different apps to load onto it, and even the device itself will be made by different manufacturers.

Whether or not you will be able to entirely avoid flying in space, I probably doubt that would be the case. But you certainly could join crews and operate as a boarding party specialist and not be flying, say on a bigger multi-crew ship. There will definitely be some FPS encounters that will be down on planet-side that will allow it. So I would say that if you prefer to do FPS, there will be that available for you to do in the game. And we're also going to be creating a sort of FPS... you know, we have Arena Commander - there's gonna be some of the FPS extension to that to allow you to practice your FPS skills without having to risk getting killed for real in space.

We're still trying to figure out what we'll do for the bigger ship, one of the things we've talked about is having them in an orbit and then you take a shuttle down to the surface.So you'll certainly be able to hang out on the ships you've got, but maybe instead of being in the hangar, you're in orbit, and you look out of the windows and there's space and the planet you're around outside it.

I mean high latency obviously effects any stuff, and packet loss, we definitely will be going back and forth with a lot of data because the ships are pretty heavy data-wise, they have lots of moving parts. So that potentially could be an issue, but that's sort of the stuff we want to be working on and testing out. That's the whole part of the Dogfighting Module and also why we want to have the final MMO back-end, at least a rudimentary version of it, working for the dogfighting. There are advantages to the space sim part of Star Citizen or Squadron 42 in terms of multiplayer net-code compared to an on-foot first person shooter. Now of course we do have an on-foot first person section, so that will have the same problems that you have in Call of Duty or something. But basically when you fly a ship, you can't--the problem with a first person shooter is I can be here and then I can step here then step here. So basically the movements of your avatar can be fairly random and not very easy to predict. Whereas in a ship you can't do that, you've got to turn. So essentially in the spaceship scenario you can actually do a much better job of predicting where the player's ship is going to be.
