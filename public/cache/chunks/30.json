When a connection is suffering from high packet loss, reliable stream transport can lead to head-of-line-blocking causing high latency due to the receiver needing to process all packets in the order they were sent, and any lost packets having to be re-sent before the receiver can continue processing the stream. QUIC addresses this by allowing a connection to simultaneously have multiple independent streams. The hope is that packet loss will work out in such a way that head-of-line-blocking will only affect a small number of those streams at any one time, allowing the other streams to continue without additional latency.<br><br>We have our own custom transport protocol layered on top of UDP. Like QUIC it provides end-to-end encryption, error detection, and is designed to mitigate various kinds of attacks. Unlike QUIC our protocol is message-based rather than stream-based and supports both fully reliable as well as semi-reliable messages. Semi-reliable means that the receiver will send an acknowledgement (ACK) back to the sender when it receives one of these messages, or a no-acknowledgement (NACK) when it detects a message is missing. This allows the sender to keep track of what the receiver has received. In fact we keep track of this information per entity and per connection. The sender then uses this information to only send incremental delta updates about the current state of game entities. If the sender knows that the receiver hasn't received a previous change then it will re-send that data along with any new changes. In other words, semi-reliable transport allows us to only ever send the latest minimal set of changes to an entity's state. Effectively every entity has its own stream and head-of-line-blocking isn't possible. Now, we do also support fully reliable messages and these can suffer from head-of-line-blocking but these messages are very much the minority and are prioritised above the semi-reliable ones so when a problem does occur it is usually resolved very quickly.<br><br>Our protocol has been thoroughly tested and has been shown to be stable, efficient, and have low latency overhead, in even the worst network conditions. Telemetry data backs this up with the vast majority of our clients having very low pings. That said, we're always looking to improve it. All reliable messages are currently treated as a single stream per connection but we are considering ways of breaking this up into multiple independent streams similar to QUIC. Congestion control, flow control, better support for WiFi connections, improved security and compression, and general performance improvements, are all areas we are looking at.<br><br>So the other part of your question is about where the current latency and connection issues come from. I'm afraid there isn't a single answer for that. The most common connection issues are the 30000 disconnection pop-up and infinite loading screens. The 30k happens when the client loses connection with the server. Although this can be caused by network issues it most frequently occurs when the server crashes. Infinite loading screens happen when either the client or the server is waiting for some event to happen or some process to complete but it doesn't for some reason. Both happen due to bugs in the code and we prioritize fixing these above all other issues. However since the game is still in development we are always writing new code and unfortunately that means we're always creating new bugs. We take great pains to avoid creating new bugs and finding any that are created as soon as possible but some always slip through the net. Likewise, latency issues can have multiple different causes and some issues that may seem like they would be caused by network latency can actually be caused by other factors such as server frame-rate, backend services issues, streaming delays, or excessive filtering. As with all issues it is important to, 1) report it, 2) be as precise as possible when describing the issue so we can figure out where exactly the problem is.<br><br>Sorry for the long-winded reply and thanks for your support. I hope you continue to enjoy the game. And Happy New Year!", "question": "@cjohnson I am curious to why QUIC or a protocols like QUIC aren't implemented in the delivery of packets. To optimize network preformance, I would make the suggestion that Quick UDP Internet Connection be adopted in future releases of the game. Unfortunately, the technology is still new to me, but I can say that it is Open Source and would contribute to the network stability of the game. Over the last couple of days I have noticed loss connection issues while attempting to stream. To greatly increase the playability of the game it would be something to look into. I was wondering what The Devs think about it.<br><br>Are network problems an issue to any of the players? Is glitching through objects because of lag an issue to players?

So you\u2019d be interested to know the character in Pupil to Planet to a character called Joaquim Steiger in Squadron 42 scan of the actor.<br /><br />What you saw in Pupil to Planet was an untouched up head and that was a Tier two character. Our rating is at top is tier zero, so that is what we used for Gary Oldman, Mark Hamill, Liam Cunningham, Mark Strong, they\u2019re all tier zero. Then tier one is the next level so actually the actor Steven Bustling who\u2019s playing Marrow is a tier one head and then the next one down is a tier two which is what Joaquim Steiger, and then we have a tier three head and that\u2019s basically our ratings, but all of our heads have pretty much similar fidelity and they all have to stand up next to head other because you could be standing in a conversation with a tier zero, a tier one and a tier two and really the big difference between the tier one and the tier one\u2019s and the two\u2019s is the tier zero just has more facial density in the mesh. So for instance we use 40,000 polygons when you\u2019re up close to a tier zero. Where as a tier one, tier two, and tier three are about 10,000.<br /><br />JH: Yeah, Much less.<br /><br />CR: Much less, but 10,000 up until now, the top level of triple AAA, up close, cinematic head character.<br /><br />JH: Even our bottom level is the top level of most other games.<br /><br />CR: You\u2019d have to look close to see really that much difference. So we do it for the Gary Oldman and the Mark Hamill\u2019s of the world because we really want to capture every single nuance of their face when their performing and talking in motion and so in those ones for the main characters you\u2019re right up close to them and you want have some emotion to it, we\u2019re just going for a little more fidelity in the character, but you know a tier zero and a tier one almost have the same number of blend shapes, almost the same number of bones, and so outside the mesh itself having just more density of faces, it\u2019s pretty much the same and so the difference is really just\u2026 the wrinkle maps also give you a lot of detail, but maybe just a kind of little detail.<br /><br />JH: A little bit of subtle bits in the animation I think is going to be some of it. The texture sizes are all the same between all the heads so that particularly doesn\u2019t change much. Certain characters like you mention, Mark Strong has a very specific way that he speaks. So he kind of like me speaks out of mostly one side of his mouth so you really want to capture that, right? And that\u2019s because he\u2019s a Tier 0 so you really want to get that across.<br /><br />CR: Yup so like I said, no Morrow\u2019s Tour, that\u2019s the past. We\u2019ve moved on and done quite a lot and you can see in this video some of the differences for what it is and like we were talking earlier, there\u2019s going to be a fair amount of improvement even from here in terms of what we\u2019re doing with the shaders. So it\u2019s generally the way it works in development is you think something looks good and then next year it looks better and the year after it looks better, you can just look at the Hornet or the Bengal carrier that we had when I launched the 2012 crowdfunding campaign and I thought that was awesome and I think a lot of other people did, but every year I see stuff moving even now, if you\u2019ve just seen the video with Chris Smith\u2019s new Hornet or the stuff that Nate was showing with the Bengal, it\u2019s like a whole another level.<br /><br />JH: Totally yeah.<br /><br />CR: And that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re pushing on the heads, but yeah what we want to do is we want you to feel like you\u2019re in say Squadron 42 or even in the PU, having a conversation, interacting with NPCs and the quality of the character animation, the facial animation is what previously you would have experienced in a pre-rendered cinematic and so that is a goal to really try and put you in the story so to speak.<br /><br />So that\u2019s what we\u2019re shooting for, I think we\u2019re going to get there, but it\u2019s definitely taking a lot of hard work.

Say Starfarer if we get pirates or other players try and overtake the ship, can we shut the lights out and pull on night vision of some kind as countermeasures to survive/kill them?", "answer": "So, the answer is yes. This is one of the big things that we keep talking about - Item System 2.0 - which is really a refactoring of the items and the entity system and will fold across into how the characters &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; what we call players inside the code &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; and vehicles will function. It's to allow a lot more functionality and control.So right now on the ships, especially on the multi-crew ships, a lot of the functionality isn't there because we have a lot of the old items and we're just moving over to the new ones not fully implemented in there, so we're in this half way state.Each new release we add a bit more of the code although we don't necessarily change the items themselves over to using the new code yet. When we have enough of the base code in we'll just do a pass on all the items and we'll move over to the Item 2.0 functionality, which will allow a lot more &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; for instance, for ships in multi-crew and seats, or stations, you'll be designate control over different things like passive control of a turret to another seat, have different seats have control over things like engineering, power distribution and stuff like that, shield management and also just ship systems.Some stuff that we worked on- there's some pretty cool prototype stuff. I think at some point we're going to be showing it. Not necessarily in this session but during some of the prototype stuff that allows you to go to a control centre and turn off lights in sections or lock down doors or turn off power, or potentially even turn off the gravity generator.There's going to be a lot of tools for people on ships &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; especially the bigger ships &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; to be able to micromanage the systems internally which you could potentially use to slow down or thwart people boarding and vice-versa. The other side of it is that people trying to take over a ship could potentially cause havoc and damage by cutting power nodes or getting access to a control room and then shutting other people in.All this is pretty cool, of course, certain levels of control have certain security access has to come with a card or something else but all that functionality comes with Item 2.0. All the items that are connected by pipes. We've talked a lot about the pipe concept where they- power goes between items or items will vent heat and it'll go into the pipe system and then you'll have to get rid of that heat or else it'll start to back into the items and damage them but we have other things like data or CPU power.For instance if you have a targeting computer and it's trying to resolve targets and it was connected to say a single core computer well it'll only get so many data cycles from the CPU and so maybe it takes five seconds or six seconds to resolve the target whereas if you had a dual-core CPU so you have your avionics module and then you have two processors in two of the slots then potentially that could be maybe three seconds to resolve the target.So we sort all sorts of stuff on how you configure ships and how we build out and configure ships that allow all sorts of nuance and control and then again if players get in there or subsystems get damaged during combat, what's cool is that because each one of these items needs power, for instance, to operate and it needs, like I was saying, CPU cycles or perhaps it needs, for instance if you have a live support like on a ship then we have an oxygen pipe and that would go up in the life support unit and if someone destroyed the life support unit then there'd be no oxygen coming in therefore you better put on a space suit because pretty soon you would start to asphyxiate.So it's all systematic so if damage happens to the bigger ships as bits blow up on the outside there will be radial explosions and that potentially could hit items a little further in and those items themselves could be damaged or explode and they could hit further ones, and so you'd have a cascade of damage and it could effect- it could cut out the power node which is something that could therefore happen on a bigger ship is that you have a power plant and then power is distributed via nodes to turrets and various systems &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; lights, whatever &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; around the ship and obviously with the power plant going down you're in trouble but even if there's damage to the side of the- to one side of the ship, say the starboard side or something like that and takes out one of the power nodes then anything after that power node will be out of power.Now, there might be gameplay where you would go to fix up the power nodes and reconnect the power, on the bigger ships there might be a lot of alternate ways &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; more than sort of one power node route and you could go to the systems management and reroute the power from one node to another node to get power going back to the remaining turret or something like that. All that functionality is going to be incredibly cool to have a massive amount of gameplay potential. It'll make crewing and using the bigger ships &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; the multi-crew ships and obviously the cap ships that we've got &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; a huge fun experience.So that's kind of some of the stuff that we're most excited by as far as the space adventuring combat side and I think you've not really seen that level of stuff in a game before and it is very much like the Sci-Fi movie, running about on the enterprise and Scotty's trying to fix up the- the- warp drive and all the rest of the stuff. So we'll definitely have a lot of that, and part of it will be turning of the lights and shutting the doors and that sort of stuff.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 83", "source": "https://youtu.be/vJoHlCc4Y7E", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Jmojo", "published_at_timestamp": 1461010317}, {"objectID": "373675340", "question": "In the PU, especially relating to PvP encounters, how will we know if an enemy player ship has hostile intent before getting fired upon? For example, if pirates are laying in wait within civilian traffic, setting up an ambush, and I'm escorting a convoy they want to raid, will it be possible to ID the pirates as hostile before or even after they open fire on my charge? Will there be an in-game process for this, or will the initiative advantage always lie in favor of the attacker? Further, in the example given above, would the presence of \"AWACS\" type ship like the Hornet Tracker help balance things in favor of the defender?", "answer": "Calix Reneau: It's a matter of scanning. At the heart of the question is that how much you can identify the ships around you. The Hornet Tracker definitely does have the advantage in resolution of scanning. But overall you'll be able to tell, if you're in a civilian area, you'll probably be within proximity to tell whether or not a given ship has their weapons powered. They're still fleshing out all those systems but there's also the element of... Keeping track of that is going to be hard. That's why you want somebody dedicated to it. That's part of the purpose of multi-crew is to be able to say, \"Here is a minefield of potential attackers, go through them and flag for yourself what you believe to be a threat.\" If you have determined that this guy is on his way and not really a threat right now, you can mark him as such. And it's about... We want to allow a clever pirate to do this situation but we also are very focused on giving the defender the tools with which they need to defend themselves.Matt Sherman: YeahCR: Not everything is about simply bringing a big enough convoy that nobody wants to attack you. You still need to be able to proactively work in your defense. The sensation that you're at the disadvantage, probably not going to go away. That's just how it feels to walk into an ambush. But you will be able to look out into the crowd and try to have the information to determine for yourself if someone is dangerous. One thing I forgot to mention is that we're also revisiting how we're interacting with the HUD, trying to make it a little more intuitive to move through the actions, and arrive at the thing that you intended to do. So whereas right now it's a little bit cumbersome to track multiple targets or switch between them and get more detail about those ships; we're hoping that as we drill down into each of these actions for the purpose of multi-crew we'll be able to also start looking at making that interaction a little bit more intuitive and natural for use. Because you want somebody in multi-crew to empower this gameplay. But you also don't want to be locked out of it if you're on your own. So you'll never be as good but we can make it better.MS: Yeah. And one other thing also, getting that tagged information on people is the ability to also share that information. So if you have a group of four or five ships, it's not going to be just on one guy or one ship to do all that scanning. Everyone can be scanning small packets of the traffic around and then sharing that data among their group. I mean that's one of the things for like a Herald, where you have Hornet Tracker and the Herald, that tracker's going to start spotting people, tagging them, passing that info into a Herald. That Herald can relay it to its other friendlies nearby. And so you can web out that information a lot nicer than just, everyone has to do it themselves. It won't be that tedious.", "title": "10 for the Designers: Episode 05 (2015.06.29)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Neo404oDUyI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Zilch", "published_at_timestamp": 1455576909, "time": "20m34s"}, {"objectID": "373679850", "question": "I am not sure if this question has been asked before but will there be physics &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; rigged props and objects in the general universe and on planets that we can interact with?

You can go around Covalex Shipping Hub now, there are definitely floating items that are all region entities that you can push around. There's been some pretty cool videos made, but one video was taking the noodle dispenser machine and pushing it out loading it into a Constellation and flying back to Port Olisar which was pretty awesome! So essentially yes absolutely. We actually had more in Crusader originally when we were developing and we took some of them out. Mainly because we still got to work on the, now working for all these rigid entities to be efficient so they're not always sending messages.Basically if a cup is sitting on this table and it's not moving there's no reason for it say \"update\" there's no reason for it to do anything over the network. CryEngine doesn't really work that way so we've been spending a lot of time and we still are spending a lot of time trying to fix and refactor that. You're sort of seeing problems that come with the CryEngine old way of doing things. Cause really it was built as a single player game so a lot of the updating is player centric but the problem we have is so for instance if there's sixteen players on the Crusader map and they all go to different comms arrays well they're all triggering different AI in different spots on the server and it's running all these AI and then it's also telling every single client what all these AI are doing but i'm flying around and i'm at comm array A over here and someone's at comm array B over there, I don't really need to know what's happening in comm array B, I just need to know what's happening in my area.So we have to refactor the updating of the object and also the network messaging to it's more specific to what people's view is and that's ongoing sort of network task we have and part of that is going to have a more efficient network version for simple rigid bodies so you can have the cups on the table and you can have more props around. The idea would be to physicalise chairs, props like that so you can push them around or whatever. If you're flying in your ship and the gravity goes off and you haven't bolted things down they could float and all the rest of the stuff.

For example, would it be possible to interact with more players on a station or planet side since there are no ship assets to render?", "answer": "It sort of all depends. I would say we haven't quite, this is something we're actively working on. It's very possible that the number of players in any one area would potentially be dependent on the kind of location they're in, and also the networking. To give an example, on FPS, we're pretty sure we'll be able to have say 32 players in some of the aspects of it, and that's because it's just a player and a character, vs. the ships are much harder, because a ship is, first of all you have a player inside each ship, and a ship is very complicated, has lots of moving parts, and all those moving parts require some level of networking simulation, so more complicated items like spaceships take up more network bandwidth. So if it's just people running around on foot, in an infantry environment, the odds are that we should be able to have more of them than we would, once we're in space and people are dogfighting. And that's not to say that we're not trying to push it to get as much as we possibly can, we're playing around with, I think I've mentioned this before but, the possibility of having servers in the same dataserver all working together on the same area or instance, and essentially sharing the workload of simulating that area, and sharing the workload of telling the clients they are responsible for where they are in the world. And doing that, we'll potentially be able to have more players in one area than one server could simulate, this is still very early, but that's one of the approaches we're looking at. But it's definitely probably the case that there's going to be more players in certain areas than others. I know that when we do the social module, Tony's aiming for a lot more players than we have right now out in space, and actually more than they have in the top end of what they think they're going to do in FPS.

So, it's definitely one of the things I'm looking forward to digging into once we get to that stage.Will Weissbaum: Yeah, the franchisement that comes from citizenship and either getting involved that way or we have this Tevarin candidate who's running right now in the Dispatches for senate and thinking of - how will the players be able to influence that campaign or effect the political issues and on top of it, based on their feedback on who they want to see elected, when that person does come into power to kind of have it feel like it made a difference, like that person coming into office changed the universe in some way.

So, we've also talked about the ability to hide your ID, so if you've stolen a ship you can maybe get your ID changed or spoofed. I definitely think there will be systems out there that will potentially allow you to have a signature that would look like a different kind of ship and that could be pretty useful. For instance, you could have a signature to make you look like a freighter but you're not &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; as a trap &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; or something like that.So that's the sort of stuff longer term as we flesh out the signature and scanning system that we will definitely have in the game.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 57 (2015.03.23)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Aoooemaw2lY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Jagger", "published_at_timestamp": 1427148202}, {"objectID": "373683440", "question": "We've seen several lore bits already about the different HUD manufacturers and their offerings and how ships are going to have unique HUDs down the road.

We're actually doing a pass right now to have the HUDs between the Hornet, and the 300i, and the Aurora be different. And the other ships we bring in will also have their own sort of look and difference of HUD, and we're also going to have different functionality that the ships' targeting computers, ships' systems, all bring in. So a more bare bones ship will have a lot less sort of heads-up features than, say, a dedicated dogfighter with state of the art technology.So not all of that's there right now - you pretty much get the whole package. But the idea would be for instance the Hornet could track multiple targets at once, whereas an Aurora can only track one target at once. And, you know, some of the targeting stuff on a base ship would be a simple set, and then you could buy extra add-ons to add features to make you track more targets, to do different firing solutions... all those kinda things. Because to let you customize the look and the functionality are two things that we have planned for the HUDs.

Which we'll be unveiling and showing some of that stuff later on this year, probably at GamesCom. But yeah, we're planning to do a whole bunch of stuff in zero-g. We already have some zero-g functionality in, which when you guys get your hands on the Arena Commander and the Dogfighting Module, you'll actually be able to do some level of EVA after you've ejected, which is pretty cool. But we're gonna have grabbing onto surfaces and pushing off of surfaces as part of the design. And I'm assuming that we'll have physical impulses. If you get hit, it could potentially knock you off a surface. I'm guessing if you had mag-boots attached and you got hit, then you'd expect to have your boots stay in place unless the force is really big.So all those kinds of things are planned to be modeled in. Hopefully with as high a fidelity as possible, but we'll see. We're actually kind of excited by just the first person shooter part.

They're the small sort of tablet like or netbook like computers, which don't have the computing power to do Star Citizen.So that's not necessarily a focus of ours, I'm not saying that we wouldn't potentially do some exploration in support of it down the road, but I would say that would be a later task.
