They have priorities for both the PU and Squadron 42, where from their development standpoint Squadron 42 is their top priority, and as a result most of the team and most of the resources are focused towards that. On top of this, whilst they have things that are solely Squadron, and some that are for both Squadron and the PU, there are also things that are solely for the PU, and it's those things that won't get as much love (for now) due to their priority as a whole being Squadron. When Squadron is done and ready to go, the PU should get some more attention.

As such, their priority is to finish that work before they return to any PU-focused work.

This guy is gathering resources, this guy moved it to the refinery, this guy does- we\u2019re trying to kind of create this vicious circle where everyone interacts with everyone rather than having \u201cthis is one career and it works on it\u2019s own\u201d - it never works on it\u2019s own.<br /><br />A pirate without transporters is pointless, a mercenary that doesn\u2019t have transporters to defend or to fight or some reward to fight for - there is no point for him. Everyone has these ...<br /><br />So, the more combat oriented professions we have, the more non-combat oriented professions we\u2019ll need to add because these guys like to attack these guys and these guys like to develop and go away from these guys. So it\u2019s an interesting gameplay where you\u2019re trying to protect yourself while still doing your experiments or still mining or stuff like that. So, all of these professions have a bit of combat in them because people with combat will not leave you alone.<br /><br />So yeah, it\u2019s\u2026 we\u2019re definitely not ignoring all combat, this is something we\u2019re keen on, we want those professions to prosper. Those are the money makers, the other guys are just preying on them, they\u2019re stealing from them but these are what keeps the entire economy of the world going, is the mining, refining, producing, the scientists, the...all of this stuff definitely. <br /><br />--Yes, it\u2019s very interesting that you say like more gathering type of stuff, like...so maybe you can say the Reliant Sen is space\u2019s exploration/science vessel so it would be more in the aspect of gathering certain things for science and exploration and like a 315p more of the exploration role.--<br /><br />There\u2019s different types of exploration where you go to a sun and analyze its corona and find if you can find some places where maybe some things can be harvested, sell that information to the harvesting guys who has the tools cause you might not have all the ships to do, you have one and you specialize and are very good in that thing and you do that part. You might have another ship that basically goes in a nebula and starts running experiments there and that\u2019s completely different things or one that gathers bio samples and grows weird life species in space that can only grow in space because you\u2019re in zero-G and you have a special room for them rather than on a planet.<br /><br />So we want to run all these experiments and the results of these experiments will open up new technologies in the world which were not available before or maybe they were available to certain people but not you and your organization and your guys. So, that\u2019s the beauty of having science in the game because it keeps the universe constantly evolving, it\u2019s not a static thing like, \u2018oh, I\u2019ve learned everything there is nothing new for me\u2019. There is constantly new things to discover and evolve the economy and the entire gameplay of the world.

A first person perspective game usually places a lot of value on the identity of self, and so, it would seem the SC character builder should eventually be extremely important. What plans, hopes do you foresee for the longer term intentions? Will the SC builder bring the fidelity of character both in aesthetics as well as customization that we've seen in our ships?", "answer": "Omar Aweidah: So, customizing your face and the ever growing technology. I think in the very beginning probably in the Alpha phase when you'll start to get to choose it. You'll probably just choose between a variation of heads. After that I believe it's going to be, we're choosing heads, we're starting to maybe move some of the geometry around and creating more customized face. There's a lot of potential for major customization since our characters share the same topology and the same UV space.We've actually done a few tests in here which turn out to make these horrible monsters but sometimes hilariously funny and decent looking characters by taking the texture of one character that was scanned, putting it on like, we'll take Gary Oldman's face and put it on like Webster's, the female head and it's just this crazy amalgamations of characters.It's fun but I think we're starting to realize, the tech that we have, we're going to be able to create quite a lot of variety, maybe quicker than we originally expected. Especially by reusing a lot of the maps and maybe start to adjust with like skin tone and customization of hair and eyes and all that kind of stuff. So, I think at first, it's definitely going to start simple but like the rest of our game, it grows over time. So, we definitely have goals to make it extremely customizable in much, much different... and easily implementable in the future.Adam Wieser: That sounds awesome. I know I've seen some of these missteps, they're kind of like weird faces or eyebrows that have mouths on them and all that fun stuff. I've had a few nightmares based on some of the images from them messing around with the characters and trying different things or things just kind of like getting buggy. So, it can be pretty entertaining but I've definitely walked by a few desks and almost spilled my coffee when I've seen what's on the screen.OA: A few people actually are putting together a page of all the terrible things that have happened. Like when we repathed someone's tongue onto Gary Oldman's face, so it was the shape of his face but this really nice detailed tongue texture going up the side with teeth. We were like, 'what the heck is happening'. It looked like burned flesh and I was like, 'oh my gosh'.AW: I've seen that page, it's crazy.OA: You've seen the page?AW: Yeah, I think, The Things We've Seen', that's the title of the page.OA: The Things We Have Seen.AW: Yeah, yeah.OA: Especially when animation, it's crazy or something's not done properly and then all of the sudden someone's face just shoots out to the side and you're like, 'woah'.

Now our team hierarchy, we have a lead for each team for example, we have a design lead, we have an engineering lead, we have an art lead. So these leads pretty much head that team, now when we created a task for someone, these tasks are generated in collaboration with those team leads, that way the team lead is always aware of what their subordinates are working on and we as production can see an overall picture on what work needs to be done.So the kind of tasks that get dictated to us by the leads, we look at let's say what features are coming down for the next patch. We'll sit down with the design leads, what do you need done for this so design lead will give us a list of we need this in there we need to have that in there, so we look at these features, break them down into individual tasks and look at which developers are free under that particular lead, for example with art team, if Elwin we need to have a concept for actually our hangar ready ship, we see okay we need to see one of our artists Daniel, he can do this, Gage can do this, Patrick can do this, so us as production it's our job to kind of make granular on how these tasks are broken downEric Kieron Davis: And to speak to the other question because I think that was good for the last question, the other question is, when someone is having a difficulty right, that's I think you touched on that a little bit. That's a great question and what actions have you taken? Anything, everything right? We've gone everywhere from evaluating maybe the task what incorrectly bid out, maybe we said two days and it's 3 months, major mistake right we got to get those leads again. Maybe they've had computer issues, maybe we've pulled them away too much to bugs for live things like we said in the last question I haven't been able to get to it.Maybe it just isn't working with the structure so to the last question talking about shifting things around, we've gone all the way from having full pipelines move to different locations because they had the staff for it, it wasn't necessarily because someone was failing and can't do their job, get rid of them it was more okay this isn't working out here lets evaluate why, oh, it makes sense here because they have more people, they have the right resources or maybe we realized there's one person here that needs to be apart of it, the rest are in Frankfurt, or vice versa, it's more about again, constantly evaluating as we look at our hiring practices, who we bring in, look at our overall tasks and then we shift those responsibilities around which is one of the cool thing about having as I've called it before, \"follow the sun development\".

That's a big goal of mine is to have all of these different locations that you go an visit and there's as much sightseeing as anything else.  That's one of the exciting things about the multicrew module is that we're just basically building a really large world map sort of as a sandbox to sort of be our test kitchen for the PU.  So, the large world map won't really be a real location in the Persistent Universe because we're sort of going to pack a lot of different things in this one system or area but it will be great for us to sort of test everything out and then once we've got a lot it going &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; and in the background we'll be working on these other systems... we'll just sort of switch over to the system and... the first stage of the PU will come online.  I kind of refer to multicrew as sort of baby PU because we're going to make the large world map be more of a sandbox so it's not so much Arena Commander &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; get in, have points to win, beat the other people.  We'll still let you do Arena Commander for a competition thing but that will be sort of in a limited arena area.  The large world map for the multicrew will be spawning in, kind of the same way that we're doing for the social where you can just go, hang out, come in and out, fly around and people can work together or go fight/engage NPCs/AI in certain areas or you know... mess around with other people.  So, we'll see how that goes but I think it's a really good base for all of the PU stuff that we need to work on... and actually a good base for a lot of stuff that we need for Squadron 42.So, longwinded answer but yes.  I'd like you to go and be on the floating structures &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; look down as a spectator and see races and ultimately in the final game we'll definitely have the Murray Cup go, just like Formula 1, between different locations and one will be a race through asteroids and another will be a race through structures and we'll have these different locations and you can go and spectate and we'd have qualifiers and then we'd actually have the competition that players could come to and other players could come and watch and we'd also have sort of livestream it and that's all the sort of stuff that we want to do to make this universe feel more real and more alive.. you know, get lost in it.

It's why I chose it, and I love Roman history, and I love that this game is inspired by Roman history. That being said, the game is not a mirror for Roman history. If it was, it'd be pretty anti-climactic, because we'd all know where this would be going. The game does have elements... the Roman empire did inspire different systematic problems that did come up. In the reference here to the 3rd Century, that was Diaclesian basically ended up dividing the empire, and there is a bit of internal discussion within our universe whether Sol should stay the capital of the UEE or whetherCH: Terra! Terra!AW: Terra supporters, whether it should be moved there, a more progressive capital, so again, that is inspired by the Roman Empire. The 5th century is the Roman empire really came to a close, with the Barbarian and Vanduul raids of the Empire, and we do have the Vanduul that are consistently pushing into UEE territory, so that's something that we also have worked into the game. Again, there's nothing saying that they're going to take over, to be quite honest that's what the backers and the players are here to do, is help write the history of the UEE, and maybe steer it on a different course than was set by the ROman Empire. So, good question, good inspiration, but yeah, we're not opening the timeline and planning stuff out bit by bit.

So we definitely want to include that sort of stuff in-game, it's also one of the biggest ideas for the Banu MM, so you could fly around buying and collecting things, then sell them in your greeting/trading room on-ship. There will probably be some version of a local-system based version of Craig's list, where you post things for sale, then people can browse them then contact you, before arranging a meeting place, then while you're both there you'd transfer the goods.

The initial thinking was you would take jobs for people in your ship - they ask you, \"oh, we need you to take this many tons of goods from this planet to that planet\" - and also you could get hired to be a pilot of a ship. So, I'm not sure whether we're necessarily thinking about letting you sort of be, \"okay, I take a job as a gunner on a ship,\" but it's kind of a natural extension of being a pilot of a ship, so that potentially could probably happen. I mean, NPC AI and intelligence has been set up in a way that you would... you know, you could a player on a ship and the pilot of the ship is an NPC. So that's not ruled out - it would really sort of determine [be determined by] how our mission and job hiring board would happen, and then also how we would control the meta-AI of the NPCs. So, you know, if a ship itself has its own persistence and it goes from planet to planet, back and forth, and it would have a crew, then maybe you could crew it.

Will that process change with the addition of multi-crew ships?", "answer": "So, yes, yes, yes, and yes!Yeah, we're actually working... we have a design for the lobby and the matchmaking system. It's obviously going to involve the organizations. So basically organizations will be sort of groups, and we'll fold in a part of the organization system to also support ad hoc groups that you could build - so almost like an ad hoc organization, cos really an organization is just a grouping of people. So like just a friends list, or an ad hoc group, is really just a flat organization that you can create and destroy on the fly. But yeah, we're working on that, so we've been sort of fleshing out the design for that, and our goal is to get that up and running... hopefully by 1.0. So 0.9, which is what we're gonna be releasing just after Gamescom is... we call it interally \"release 13\" and the next big one will be release 14, and I'm expecting that we should have some kind of lobby and matchmaking stuff by release 14 - which is Arena Commander v1.0.

It's hard to definitively say that now 'cause we're still early in the development process.New hardware comes out every year, so generally we've been aiming at the very high end of hardware now is what we think the mid-level will be by the time the game is fully finished. So that would have been a GTX 680 or now a 780 on the Nvidia side, or on the AMD side, a 7970 or now the R9290X on the AMD side. And you should be able to easily run in the highest details in the game in 1080p. If you want to move to 4k, you'll need the very high end cards that will be available, smoothly at 4k that is, next years or maybe current day high-level to mid-high level cards but two of them in SLI.The engine scales really well so it can, it will take whatever you can give it in whatever resolution you give it, but you can also scale it down and it still looks pretty good.
