A popular aquarium fish, banded fessles in captivity have been bred to encourage docility and to accentuate their deep blue vertical stripes.</p><br/><h1>Description</h1><br/><p>Banded fessles are identifiable by their ovular heads, protruding mouths, and deep blue and white stripes. These stripes help them camouflage themselves among the seaweed and coral of their natural environment. They have squat, triangular dorsal fins, lowslung pectoral fins, and broad, strong tails. Their mouths are lined with two rows of small, sharp teeth which they use for grasping and consuming prey. Over a ten-year life cycle, a banded fessle can grow to between 40 and 50 cm long.</p><br/><h1>Behavior and Ecology</h1><br/><p>Banded fessles are ambush hunters, preying mainly on smaller fish, macroinvertebrates, and zooplankton. They play an important role in their ecosystem, keeping worms and other creatures from over-grazing on vegetation and disrupting delicate coral reefs. When hunting, a banded fessle floats motionless among local environmental features until a prey animal passes about 5 cm from its hiding spot. It then strikes before its prey is aware of its presence. At around three years of age, a banded fessle will begin to seek out a mate. Banded fessles form lifelong pairs. Each fish will protect the other from threats, assist in hunting, share larger prey, and fend off potential suitors. A banded fessle that has lost its mate sometimes refuses to seek another.</p><br/><p>When they are ready to spawn, the pair seek out an appropriate spawning medium, usually a strong seaweed frond or sheltered coral surface. The female then lays a line of eggs and the male fertilizes them. They repeat this process until they have laid up to a thousand eggs. The parents guard their offspring until they learn to hunt on their own. About 1 percent survive to adulthood.</p><br/><p>In general, banded fessles seldom venture more than 12 meters deep, although they have been recorded at depths of 15 meters when pursuing prey.</p><br/><h1>Aquarium Fish</h1><br/><p>Prized for their pairing behavior and their vibrant, contrasting colors, banded fessles are one of the more popular aquarium fish in the UEE. They number among the marine life that can be raised in tanks alongside fish indigenous to Earth (Sol III). Ideally, they should be kept in warm saltwater, about 24 to 25 degrees Celsius. Because they can grow to be up to 50 cm long, they should only be kept in very large tanks (750 liters or more per fish).</p><br/><p>The banded fessle is not territorial, but as a carnivore, it can pose a danger to other fish in a shared tank. It is recommended that generous portions of food be provided to fessles so they do not get hungry and turn on their tank mates.", "title": "Galactapedia: Banded Fessle", "id": "bZwvaaLll6", "slug": "banded-fessle", "template": "PlantAnimal", "type": "galactapedia"}, {"objectID": "9e753f546fd1_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "<h1>STANTON SYSTEM</h1><br/><p>The Stanton system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE), discovered in SEY 2851 by navjumper Toshi Aaron. It is one of only two fully colonized systems in the UEE, and is made up of three super-Earths, a gas giant, an asteroid belt, and a G-type star. All planets in the system were sold by the UEE government to four major corporations soon after their discovery. While inhabitants are protected under UEE's common laws, they are also subject to rules imposed by the individual corporations that own each planet.</p><br/><h1>PLANETARY SYSTEM</h1><br/><p>The system's star, Stanton, is a G-type main sequence star about the same size as Sol, and is roughly 4.6 billion years old. Its three terrestrial planets, Hurston (Stanton I), ArcCorp (Stanton III), and microTech (Stanton IV) all sit in the system's green band, and were terraformed to support Human life. Unique among gas giants, Crusader (Stanton II) has a nitrogen-oxygen upper atmosphere and a natural ecosystem made up of plants and animals that live their entire lives in midair. A dense asteroid belt sits between ArcCorp and Crusader.</p><br/><h1>DISCOVERY</h1><br/><p>In 2851, navjumper Toshi Aaron was scanning for anomalies in the outskirts of the Magnus system. She had spent the last decade trying to fulfill her dream of discovering a jump point, spending as much time as she could in pursuit. A week before her 49th birthday, she detected a strange signal. She noted the location, recorded all the data she could, and headed home to analyze what it could mean. All signs pointed to the likelihood that she had indeed found what she'd been looking for. A few days later, with a ship fully equipped to make the leap, she returned to the location and entered the jump tunnel. After a few harrowing moments traversing interspace, she found herself on the other side. </p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>Aaron's discovery made waves in the UEE government. Not only were all the planets in the system located within the green band, but when UEE pathfinders surveyed the system, they found a jump point that connected Stanton to Terra. The UEE immediately claimed the system and dispatched naval engineers to determine what would be needed to make the three terrestrial planets habitable. Their eventual report brought bad news: the funds required to terraform these planets would be far more than the then cash-strapped government had available to them. While officials debated what to do, they gave the Navy authorization to construct a shipbuilding latticework on Stanton II's upper atmosphere, and allowed engineers to begin preliminary terraforming activity on the other planets. </p><br/><p>By 2865, the UEE Senate, facing a potentially recession-causing budget shortfall, announced that it would be selling each of the planets in the system to the highest bidders. Multiple megacorporations reached out to or were contacted by the UEE government. After a long period of closed-door negotiations, four corporations emerged victorious: Hurston Dynamics, who purchased Stanton I and began major mining operations at once; Crusader Industries, who claimed Stanton II and its skeletal shipyards for the construction of their Starliners; ArcCorp, who immediately began developing Stanton III to support their diverse industries; and microTech, who considered the Stanton IV's frigid climate as beneficial for cooling their extensive network of servers.</p><br/><h1>CULTURE</h1><br/><p>In essence, the Stanton system is an enormous business park. While all who reside within it are protected under the UEE Common Laws, the enforcement of these laws is left up to the private security forces each corporation employs. Nearly everyone in Stanton works for one of the four corporations, or for companies that lease land or office space from them. As such, each planet is operated according to the business practices of its particular company. On Hurston, for example, Hurston Dynamics' lax environmental policy has led to a polluted atmosphere and a low quality of life for its people. Conversely, Crusader Industries' commitment to design has transformed the once sparse Navy shipbuilding platforms into beautiful live-work spaces lined with flowering trees.</p><br/><p>The leaders of Hurston Dynamics, Crusader Industries, ArcCorp, and microTech hold the Stanton System Conference once a year to discuss system-wide issues.

It was brokered in SEY 2789 (MXY III.1040) by the Senator of Terra, Terrence Akari, and Xi'an Emperor Kr.\u0113. Due to the political instability of the late Messer Era (SEY 2546 - 2792), negotiations for this treaty were conducted in secret on the Tohil system on undeveloped world Tohil III. The holiday Armistice Day, created in celebration of the war's end, is held annually in the UEE on 29 May. </p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>In the latter years of the Messer Era, the UEE and the Xi'an Empire had been on the brink of war for over two centuries, and public sentiment on both sides was strongly in favor of ending the conflict. Planetary systems that bordered the two empires were kept under constant military surveillance, draining funding that was desperately needed in other areas. Major Houses within the Xi'an Empire had lodged protests against sending their youth to face uncertain fates against a hostile enemy, and, with the threat of Vanduul attacks becoming a large concern, Humans began to doubt the Messer regime's continued use of the Xi'an as the cause of all the UEE's problems. Additionally, Linton Messer XI was an unpopular ruler. He had left his father's brutal policies in place instead of undoing them as he had promised his supporters before his SEY 2781 coup, and his habit of swift and deadly retaliation had lost him most of his allies in the Senate and the military. Conditions were ripe for the opening of a road to peace. </p><br/><p>Senator Terrance Akari of Terra and Emperor T.u\u0113ng se Kr.\u0113 of the Xi'an Empire first began exchanging communications in SEY 2775 (MXY III.1032). The Senator had long held an interest in Xi'an culture, and utilized his political status to pull strings and pass questions along to the Xi'an government when he came up against a cultural concept he didn't understand. To his surprise, the Emperor himself began responding to his missives. Kr.\u0113 recognized the opportunity for what it was: a chance to cultivate a connection to the second highest echelon of Human government. As their correspondence increased over the years, they began to discuss what peace might look like between the UEE and the Xi'an Empire. </p><br/><p>In SEY 2789 (MXY III.1040), they agreed it was time to meet in person and discuss the creation of a possible treaty. After weeks of deliberation on the subject, they chose the Tohil system as the location due to its lack of military presence and position on the border of both empires. While Emperor Kr.\u0113 made his way there with the aid of his government, Akari had to escape the notice of his or risk being arrested and thrown into an Empire's Light Conversion Center for collaborating with an alien power. He enlisted the help of Terra's Advocacy Section Chief Nathan Warrick, who put Akari into contact with a group of smugglers that regularly transported anti-Messer activists between Bremen and Tohil through the unclaimed Nyx system. It was a risky undertaking; Akari was in constant danger of being apprehended by pro-Messer forces, and Emperor Kr.\u0113 was inviting war with the UEE by entering into Tohil in the first place. Their mutual safe arrival on Tohil III created a buoyant mood that Akari identified as a motivating factor in their work on what would become the Akari-Kr.\u0113 Treaty. </p><br/><p>On 11 March, the peace accord was completed, and Emperor Kr.\u0113 signed it on behalf of the Xi'an Empire. He departed for the Xi'an capital planet Ka'ua (Hyoton IV) soon after, where he would secure the approval of the Imperial House's Council of Three. Akari made his way to Earth (Sol III) and spread word about the treaty's existence amongst his most trusted staff members and fellow pro-peace Senators. On 29 May, while Linton Messer XI and his sister Fiona were on vacation in the Goss system, Akari triggered an emergency session of the Senate and called for an immediate vote on the treaty. Without the Imperator there to rally any opposition, the deal was narrowly approved. </p><br/><h1>MAIN PRINCIPLES</h1><br/><p>1 - <strong>Non-aggression agreement:</strong> The Xi'an Empire and the UEE agreed to not threaten or use force against one another's territory or independence, and to acknowledge one another's right to self-defense if subject to armed attack. </p><br/><p>2 - <strong>Border Security:</strong> Each side promised to respect one another's territory and to not cross their respective borders without permission. </p><br/><p>3 - <strong>The Perry Line:</strong> The Xi'an Empire and the UEE agreed to withdraw their military forces from the Perry Line. <br/>Political refugees. The Xi'an Empire agreed that they would accept Human refugees from the UEE, and Terra agreed to provide resources to aid in their care.</p><br/><p>4 - <strong>Status of Terra:</strong> If leadership in the UEE rejected the terms of the treaty, the peace agreement would stand between Terra and the Xi'an Empire. </p><br/><p>5 - <strong>Duration of terms:</strong> The terms of the agreement were to remain in place indefinitely unless any terms were broken or in the event of a change in structure of the UEE or Xi'an governments.</p><br/><h1>IMPACT</h1><br/><p>Historians credit Linton Messer XI's refusal to ratify the Akari-Kr.\u0113 Treaty as the moment the Messers fully lost their grip on the UEE. Although the Imperator declined to sign the accord when it arrived at his desk, the Xi'an Empire withdrew its military forces from the Perry Line as promised, demonstrating the hollowness of the Messer regime's assertion that they were the only thing standing between the people and a Xi'an invasion. This, coupled with the regime's inability to arrest Akari, who had gone into hiding, fueled public perception of Linton Messer XI as an incompetent ruler. People who had previously felt that standing against the Imperator would be too risky took the plunge and joined up, swelling the ranks of the anti-Messer movement. This influx of funding and connections would later enable the resistance group Tide to obtain footage of the Massacre of Garron II and finally end the Messer dictatorship. On 5 July SEY 2793 (III.1044.08), the Perry Line Pact was ratified and signed by the new UEE government and the Xi'an Empire, officially bringing an end to the cold war.

At the moment in Star Citizen you can change, equip and store as much as you like without many issues. But physical inventory will mean that players will need to consider every possibility when planning to do first-person combat. When you don't have access to all your equipment at the drop of a hat, that fundamentally is a game-changer, which really makes a difference when you move away from these larger built-up areas. You really have to think about the decisions you make when managing and bringing items with a finite inventory. You may end up killing someone, and want to take all their items with you, but because you\u2019ve filled your backpack up already ,you may want to drag them to your ship, or instead take them alive. When considering all the things Physical Inventory adds to the game, you can really start to see its impact on the combat gameplay loop.<br/><br/>Physical Inventory by itself has been something we are adding little by little each patch, starting with the commodity pack, then the inner thought system. We are now in the act of changing it to what we are calling the \u201cExternal Inventory\u201d, which isn't so much tetris but a grid system that will naturally mold around each item, much in the way apps change automatically when you move them around. So what that gives us is an overview of the character and the items you have as well as being able to interact with external inventories, player\u2019s backpacks, crates, and boxes, anything that may have a physical volume but not a physical representation. So that's very much in the end game when other tech comes online. At first, it\u2019ll be the commodities in the beginning, the things you can currently put in your backpack, but it means when we have the [REDACTED] you\u2019ll be able to interact with the cargo hold and put things in there or take FPS mineables out, and that\u2019ll be the next iteration. Which will eventually become full items you can put in there, and then interact with the character.

They also don't have a good way to place it somewhere, and then further it would have to be persisted, so it would need a port for it to be attached to the character.

With FPS combat in Star Citizen being described as 'tactical', I\"m wondering what motivated the removal and replacement of this game type over simply adding a second one?", "answer": "Because it's tactical. I think the best way to give an answer to this is that, in the sort of early stages of testing, the map that we had, there wasn't particularly a reason to gravitate you to any one area, so if you have team elimination game, and you don't have that many people, the end it sort of... and we also don't have respawns all the time the same time that you might have respawns in Call of Duty or another fast-paced FPS game. Then you could have the end of the match be quite boring for everyone else, where it revolves around cat-and-mouse, the last two people surviving on each one of the teams, and no-one wants to make the move because they don't want to lose the game, so we sort of felt like, for the first game mode, we wanted to have something that was more objective based that would give players a reason to fight over a location and go for a certain location, and it certainly will fit much better with what will happen in Star Citizen in general, because a lot of the time, you'll be boarding a ship, and the whole point of that will be to take it over. Go fight your way to the Bridge to take it over, or go disable the engine, and go down to the engine room, so we wanted to make the first game mode be more objective based, because we think it would be a better practice mode for what we think'll happen in the game itself, and be a bit more fun. Although we will add more game modes as we go along. We'll have Sataball come online later on, which is more sports version, kind of futuristic version of a combined basketball with football with american football. For me football, for the Americans and Canadians out there, soccer. So, we'll have more than one game mode, but we sort of felt like the best one would be sort of headquarters mode that gives people a goal to go for, and so we think that's a better representative of what the FPS combat experience will be in Star Citizen, so that's why we did it.", "title": "10 For the Chairman: Episode 67", "source": "https://youtu.be/yLjk2UvfFRA", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "[ADT] Gromph", "published_at_timestamp": 1442872931}, {"objectID": "8bd8539c64801_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "We imagine two processes for this: playing a character who is physically located in the back with the passengers (like a flight attendant) who can observe their needs, or operating a panel in the cockpit with holo footage and other informational readouts.

One of the big things about this is that we only have our small ships in and these ships have a ton of maneuverability, they are super responsive...Matt Sherman: Great acceleration, a lot better load out balance compared to as you get bigger in ships.CR: Yeah, what I expect is that the sort of World War II vision is best characterized by the medium sized multicrew ships, the Constellation all the way up to the Retaliator. These ships they're not going to be able to turn on a dime the way that an M50 or a Hornet can, they're not built around maneuverability as much, and that continues to be the case as we scale up further to the point where a battle between Capital ships is nothing like a battle between the small class ships or even the medium. I think that's pretty important actually, like if you had the World War II feeling in our small ships and we were to apply that same approach then it would quickly become untenable and maybe there are other approaches to take but I think that this one is going to give us the best mix of gameplay styles. If what you were really into is, you want that submarine battle, you're probably doing Capital ship action.MS: Yeah, I mean it's just one of the many parts that as we get all these extra systems, especially once we've gotten multicrew out there, we're really going to be able to start growing this range of gameplay choices because right now we all have speedboats and some of us are going to want the more plodding boats to try and do a broadside attack on someone. Everyone's going to want different things from the game so there's absolutely going to be different flight handling and characteristics to support that and I mean even into some of the smaller ships - there's going to be differences between who's the quick small ship and who's the more sluggish small ship but they're all still probably going to be faster than a Constellation.", "published_at_timestamp": 1433800772, "question": "Can we expect any big changes to the current small ship flight model in the near future to bring it more into line with the original 'simulation' vision or is it 'almost complete' as far as the designers are concerned?", "source": "https://youtu.be/TLE_cqaY1iI", "title": "10 for the Designers: Episode 04 (2015.06.08)", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "skuripanda", "time": "5m55s"}, {"objectID": "373676310", "question": "In a recent episode, Calix and Dan said that \"scheduling is your domain.\" How do you prioritize one bug or feature over another, and does the inclusive nature of Star Citizen's development change what gets tackled first?", "answer": "Darian Vorlick: That's interesting, because what production does IS prioritising what does come first. For example, we're on the cusp of 1.1, so when we have several critical bugs come through, we have to look at, \"is this something we can bump?\" \"Do we need to fix this right away?\" or even ask whether an implemented fix for this will break things further in other areas, or down the line.Travis Day: It's contextual really, 1.1 for example has a few new features, one of which is the Retaliator in the hangar. If there is any issue with the Retaliator, it kinda bumps it up to a higher level, because this is a new feature, a new ship, people have spent money on it, they want to see it, they want it to be awesome. So automatically any retaliator related issue, in my mind at least, raises up a little bit. If there are balance issues, or something really out of whack, or user experience issues, we'd tend to prioritise those pretty highly, because the whole point of AC is to get things balanced and fun. That's the idea behind the modular system as well, we want to have space combat down, and fun, long before the release of say SQ42 or the PU.DV: It's also iterative, we might not address a certain bug, even if it's high priority, in this patch, because there might be higher priority issues that relate more closely to user experience, or we might just not have the time before this particular patch release. We may knowingly let a bug go into a game, see if it's something that someone else is working on a fix for as well. Sometimes it's \"whack a mole\" and sometimes it's just strategic... letting damage come through, knowing it'll be addressed later on.TD: I mean, the fix may be worse than the actual issue! As an example, the landing mechanic is a little broken right now, some ships when they come in to land will tip up on the landing pad. Which is not exactly what you want to do, there are a bunch of issues that are causing that, and if we try to address all of that before a patch release in a couple of days, we risk shifting the centre of mass, which affects flight balance etc as well.

Or do we try to fix it in the next patch?", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 04 (2015.03.16)", "source": "https://youtu.be/lstuaA4WsVA", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Beer4TheBeerGod", "published_at_timestamp": 1426543213}, {"objectID": "373676680", "question": "If I'm a law abiding UEE citizen and stubble across a ship wreck in space, Should I have any reservations about salvaging the wreck and selling anything that I'm able to obtain from a legal perspective?", "answer": "No, I mean, if you come across a wreck in space, generally it'll depend on the situation. There will be 2 kinds really, there might be players fighting in space, and there could be wreckage from that, which might potentially have some kind of timer on that to avoid \"working the system\" where their friends can just pick up their remains and both profit from and insurance claim. But there will definitely be instances of wrecks being found just as wrecks, and you can definitely salvage from those no problem. We'll handle it with some level of distinction between wrecks that are spawned from previous battles which might have some stuff you can salvage, and those that are spawned from PvP battles. We'll have a system to prevent \"pretending not to know the guy that got killed\" and taking their stuff.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 53 (2015.02.16)", "source": "https://youtu.be/N2K1CH22SF8", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Shrike", "published_at_timestamp": 1424127628}, {"objectID": "373677120", "question": "It seems like missiles are currently very powerful and overly difficult to evade using countermeasures.

That's actually one of our big priority tasks right now is getting missile system tweaked, and balanced enough where it's a lot more enjoyable for players to use, and it's not so one-sided.AM: Yeah, it's definitely not balanced yet. I mean, we put out 1.0 right before Christmas knowing that it wasn't balanced, but the idea was we wanted to get an update into players hands, so that you'd have something to play over the holiday. But right now we have people on the floor working on balancing the system and improving it, so the next patch it will definitely be updated.TD: Yeah.

Will there be a benefit to having earned citizenship? Will there be planets we can't visit without citizenship or limitations on what we can do without citizenship?", "answer": "Well social status will definitely be part of the game, there's a pretty in-depth status rating. That will track your relationships with various groups and how they hold you in regard and vice-versa. Citizenship is one of the aspects. There will definitely be some stuff that having citizenship will allow you access to that not having citizenship wouldn't. Again having citizenship might be a liability, like with outlaw worlds they might not want to deal with a citizen of the UEE. It all sort of depends. But the idea is that depending on your sort of organizational relationships, some of which are the ones that are already part of our universe (the Merchant's guild, or the Mercenary guild, or the UEE itself), or some of them are player created organizations. It will sort of depend on who you interact with, how they'll reply, and how they'll deal with you, and whether they'll give you access. If you're in good standing with a mercenary's guild then perhaps they might invite you to their guild house, but if you're not they won't let you in. And that definitely applies to citizenship, so you will get access to some stuff as a citizen you wouldn't get without. Maybe you can buy some stuff you wouldn't get if you weren't a citizen, on the flip side, you might be able to buy some stuff without citizenship you might not be able to as a citizen.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 49 (2014.12.22)", "source": "https://youtu.be/rFfzlZ4bL8I", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "CyberianTiger ", "published_at_timestamp": 1419289210}, {"objectID": "373683600", "question": "Will there be different types of jump points in the PU?Example: One-way jump points, collapsing jump points, jump points that larger ships can't use. jump points that require special equipment to use after they're discovered, etc.", "answer": "I would say yes there will be different jump points.Dave, I mean let's see, I think we've discussed this, but we haven't really designed fully the mechanics, right? We've talked about potentially having some jump points that only smaller ships could path or maybe you have to fly in with a small ship, and then a big ship has to fly in a different route.Dave Haddock: Right, the recently proposed stretch goal one was the human one that collapsed, but we don't know if that's gonna be a persistent thing or...Chris: Right, well definitely there will be jump points that go from one system to another system and you won't be able to come back.So you always have to find the entrance and there could be one-way jump points, and there could be two-way jump points.No there will not be collapsing jump points, it's more about the jump points that larger ships can't use.We haven't 100%, we've had that discussion 'cause we were talking about it in the Squadron 42 story where there's gonna be parts in Squadron 42 where we actually have to chart a jump point and go into uncharted territory. We were debating, when you go through, can a Carrier follow you, and you chart the jump point just in a fighter.So we haven't fully figured that out, but there will definitely be different paths.

One, for people to play it and we get feedback in terms of \"Yes this is working,\" \"No this is not working,\" \"These are the things we would like to tweak.\" So it's like a super massive focus group.And then there's stress testing, bug testing, so we have our own dedicated group of testers, but of course on a game this big with this many things you can do, it's impossible, even if we had a testing department of 200 people, to cover it deep.Luckily we have a testing department of 200,000 people at the moment. That obviously makes a big difference because the amount of people banging away at it means that we'll probably flush out most of the problems, most of the bugs, most of the issues, at a much earlier stage than you would normally do in game development.Normally in game development, it only goes super wide once the game is released, and then it's already out there and then you start to see some things that you didn't even see in your own testing.So hopefully we'll be flushing that much earlier in our process, which is why we have the whole early module and the whole alpha testing.I would say it's a combination of feedback and stress testing, and figuring out bugs we haven't seen. Now that doesn't mean once someone finds a bug in the community that they write up a full bug report or anything like that, 'cause it's probably not practical with that many people, but what it does mean is it's a good place to find problems and then we on the development side can put our dedicated engineers and our internal test staff on it and go \"Ok, that's a bug we need to fix, we didn't see that before.\" It just gives us a great head start.And we'll probably build in some sort of automated bug report tool at some point.

Definitely once the game is live and the Persistent Universe is live and you take your ship and apply it to a Persistent Universe character, yes, you will not be able to melt it, you will not be able to trade it a back, as you're playing the game and using the ship. My sort of initial response right now is on the dogfighting module, we'll probably give you a pass and let you fly around and have some fun and potentially melt your ship. I'm not promising it just yet cause I wouldn't want people to abuse that, but I think it would be a sort of opportunity for people to try out things that they like, and decide what they really want to play with.
