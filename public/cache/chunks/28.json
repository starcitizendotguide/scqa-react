At the moment in Star Citizen you can change, equip and store as much as you like without many issues. But physical inventory will mean that players will need to consider every possibility when planning to do first-person combat. When you don't have access to all your equipment at the drop of a hat, that fundamentally is a game-changer, which really makes a difference when you move away from these larger built-up areas. You really have to think about the decisions you make when managing and bringing items with a finite inventory. You may end up killing someone, and want to take all their items with you, but because you\u2019ve filled your backpack up already ,you may want to drag them to your ship, or instead take them alive. When considering all the things Physical Inventory adds to the game, you can really start to see its impact on the combat gameplay loop.<br/><br/>Physical Inventory by itself has been something we are adding little by little each patch, starting with the commodity pack, then the inner thought system. We are now in the act of changing it to what we are calling the \u201cExternal Inventory\u201d, which isn't so much tetris but a grid system that will naturally mold around each item, much in the way apps change automatically when you move them around. So what that gives us is an overview of the character and the items you have as well as being able to interact with external inventories, player\u2019s backpacks, crates, and boxes, anything that may have a physical volume but not a physical representation. So that's very much in the end game when other tech comes online. At first, it\u2019ll be the commodities in the beginning, the things you can currently put in your backpack, but it means when we have the [REDACTED] you\u2019ll be able to interact with the cargo hold and put things in there or take FPS mineables out, and that\u2019ll be the next iteration. Which will eventually become full items you can put in there, and then interact with the character.

But we haven't fully made a decision yet but they're all going to be cool and I can't wait to see the Constellation flying out in space and you have your Merlin or Archimedes and you can take it from your Constellation and fly around and come back and dock. That's going to be pretty cool it won't be in 2.0 but hopefully will be in 2.1 we just have to finish up the final bit of binding one vehicle to another and dealing with the physics grid. But when that happens it's going to be pretty awesome and it's a whole other level of cool gameplay stuff we're going to do.", "published_at": "2015-11-16", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 70", "source": "https://youtu.be/ezrghcBRcSk", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "[127th]Chaos", "published_at_timestamp": 1447716094}, {"objectID": "373681080", "question": "In the recent FPS updates we have been told that the Team Elimination game type is being replaced with something akin to CoD's Domination. With FPS combat in Star Citizen being described as 'tactical', I\"m wondering what motivated the removal and replacement of this game type over simply adding a second one?", "answer": "Because it's tactical. I think the best way to give an answer to this is that, in the sort of early stages of testing, the map that we had, there wasn't particularly a reason to gravitate you to any one area, so if you have team elimination game, and you don't have that many people, the end it sort of... and we also don't have respawns all the time the same time that you might have respawns in Call of Duty or another fast-paced FPS game. Then you could have the end of the match be quite boring for everyone else, where it revolves around cat-and-mouse, the last two people surviving on each one of the teams, and no-one wants to make the move because they don't want to lose the game, so we sort of felt like, for the first game mode, we wanted to have something that was more objective based that would give players a reason to fight over a location and go for a certain location, and it certainly will fit much better with what will happen in Star Citizen in general, because a lot of the time, you'll be boarding a ship, and the whole point of that will be to take it over. Go fight your way to the Bridge to take it over, or go disable the engine, and go down to the engine room, so we wanted to make the first game mode be more objective based, because we think it would be a better practice mode for what we think'll happen in the game itself, and be a bit more fun. Although we will add more game modes as we go along. We'll have Sataball come online later on, which is more sports version, kind of futuristic version of a combined basketball with football with american football. For me football, for the Americans and Canadians out there, soccer. So, we'll have more than one game mode, but we sort of felt like the best one would be sort of headquarters mode that gives people a goal to go for, and so we think that's a better representative of what the FPS combat experience will be in Star Citizen, so that's why we did it.", "published_at": "2015-09-21", "title": "10 For the Chairman: Episode 67", "source": "https://youtu.be/yLjk2UvfFRA", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "[ADT] Gromph", "published_at_timestamp": 1442872931}, {"objectID": "8bd8539c64801_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "We imagine two processes for this: playing a character who is physically located in the back with the passengers (like a flight attendant) who can observe their needs, or operating a panel in the cockpit with holo footage and other informational readouts.

One of the big things about this is that we only have our small ships in and these ships have a ton of maneuverability, they are super responsive...Matt Sherman: Great acceleration, a lot better load out balance compared to as you get bigger in ships.CR: Yeah, what I expect is that the sort of World War II vision is best characterized by the medium sized multicrew ships, the Constellation all the way up to the Retaliator. These ships they're not going to be able to turn on a dime the way that an M50 or a Hornet can, they're not built around maneuverability as much, and that continues to be the case as we scale up further to the point where a battle between Capital ships is nothing like a battle between the small class ships or even the medium. I think that's pretty important actually, like if you had the World War II feeling in our small ships and we were to apply that same approach then it would quickly become untenable and maybe there are other approaches to take but I think that this one is going to give us the best mix of gameplay styles. If what you were really into is, you want that submarine battle, you're probably doing Capital ship action.MS: Yeah, I mean it's just one of the many parts that as we get all these extra systems, especially once we've gotten multicrew out there, we're really going to be able to start growing this range of gameplay choices because right now we all have speedboats and some of us are going to want the more plodding boats to try and do a broadside attack on someone. Everyone's going to want different things from the game so there's absolutely going to be different flight handling and characteristics to support that and I mean even into some of the smaller ships - there's going to be differences between who's the quick small ship and who's the more sluggish small ship but they're all still probably going to be faster than a Constellation.", "published_at": "2015-06-08", "published_at_timestamp": 1433800772, "question": "Can we expect any big changes to the current small ship flight model in the near future to bring it more into line with the original 'simulation' vision or is it 'almost complete' as far as the designers are concerned?", "source": "https://youtu.be/TLE_cqaY1iI", "title": "10 for the Designers: Episode 04 (2015.06.08)", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "skuripanda", "time": "5m55s"}, {"objectID": "373676310", "question": "In a recent episode, Calix and Dan said that \"scheduling is your domain.\" How do you prioritize one bug or feature over another, and does the inclusive nature of Star Citizen's development change what gets tackled first?", "answer": "Darian Vorlick: That's interesting, because what production does IS prioritising what does come first. For example, we're on the cusp of 1.1, so when we have several critical bugs come through, we have to look at, \"is this something we can bump?\" \"Do we need to fix this right away?\" or even ask whether an implemented fix for this will break things further in other areas, or down the line.Travis Day: It's contextual really, 1.1 for example has a few new features, one of which is the Retaliator in the hangar. If there is any issue with the Retaliator, it kinda bumps it up to a higher level, because this is a new feature, a new ship, people have spent money on it, they want to see it, they want it to be awesome. So automatically any retaliator related issue, in my mind at least, raises up a little bit. If there are balance issues, or something really out of whack, or user experience issues, we'd tend to prioritise those pretty highly, because the whole point of AC is to get things balanced and fun. That's the idea behind the modular system as well, we want to have space combat down, and fun, long before the release of say SQ42 or the PU.DV: It's also iterative, we might not address a certain bug, even if it's high priority, in this patch, because there might be higher priority issues that relate more closely to user experience, or we might just not have the time before this particular patch release. We may knowingly let a bug go into a game, see if it's something that someone else is working on a fix for as well. Sometimes it's \"whack a mole\" and sometimes it's just strategic... letting damage come through, knowing it'll be addressed later on.TD: I mean, the fix may be worse than the actual issue! As an example, the landing mechanic is a little broken right now, some ships when they come in to land will tip up on the landing pad. Which is not exactly what you want to do, there are a bunch of issues that are causing that, and if we try to address all of that before a patch release in a couple of days, we risk shifting the centre of mass, which affects flight balance etc as well. You've got to weigh it up, do we really want to risk breaking the flight of every single ship, just because it's landing on its tail end?

There will be 2 kinds really, there might be players fighting in space, and there could be wreckage from that, which might potentially have some kind of timer on that to avoid \"working the system\" where their friends can just pick up their remains and both profit from and insurance claim.

That will track your relationships with various groups and how they hold you in regard and vice-versa. Citizenship is one of the aspects. There will definitely be some stuff that having citizenship will allow you access to that not having citizenship wouldn't. Again having citizenship might be a liability, like with outlaw worlds they might not want to deal with a citizen of the UEE. It all sort of depends. But the idea is that depending on your sort of organizational relationships, some of which are the ones that are already part of our universe (the Merchant's guild, or the Mercenary guild, or the UEE itself), or some of them are player created organizations. It will sort of depend on who you interact with, how they'll reply, and how they'll deal with you, and whether they'll give you access. If you're in good standing with a mercenary's guild then perhaps they might invite you to their guild house, but if you're not they won't let you in. And that definitely applies to citizenship, so you will get access to some stuff as a citizen you wouldn't get without.

One, for people to play it and we get feedback in terms of \"Yes this is working,\" \"No this is not working,\" \"These are the things we would like to tweak.\" So it's like a super massive focus group.And then there's stress testing, bug testing, so we have our own dedicated group of testers, but of course on a game this big with this many things you can do, it's impossible, even if we had a testing department of 200 people, to cover it deep.Luckily we have a testing department of 200,000 people at the moment. That obviously makes a big difference because the amount of people banging away at it means that we'll probably flush out most of the problems, most of the bugs, most of the issues, at a much earlier stage than you would normally do in game development.Normally in game development, it only goes super wide once the game is released, and then it's already out there and then you start to see some things that you didn't even see in your own testing.So hopefully we'll be flushing that much earlier in our process, which is why we have the whole early module and the whole alpha testing.I would say it's a combination of feedback and stress testing, and figuring out bugs we haven't seen. Now that doesn't mean once someone finds a bug in the community that they write up a full bug report or anything like that, 'cause it's probably not practical with that many people, but what it does mean is it's a good place to find problems and then we on the development side can put our dedicated engineers and our internal test staff on it and go \"Ok, that's a bug we need to fix, we didn't see that before.\" It just gives us a great head start.And we'll probably build in some sort of automated bug report tool at some point.
