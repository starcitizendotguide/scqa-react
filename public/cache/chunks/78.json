What about Quantum?", "answer": "The spawn lockers are indeed going to be part of the long term solution of the game, but there are some key details you may not be aware of. First, there is an assumption here that the entities spawned by these lockers are completely blank slates and when they despawn will never be seen again. This isn't going to be the case for all of the NPCs as there's at least two mechanism we are going to use to which would result in a similar behavior to what you are looking for. First, there will be a class of NPCs of higher importance that will have some amount of virtual simulation even when no players around. These NPCs could be part of a mission for example, and their schedules and movement through the verse will be simulated in the backend. When you encounter once of these they may spawn or leave an area via a spawn locker depending on the circumstance, and you will likely see them again later.<br/><br/>Another case is that the backend will actually track entities that have been created via a character archtype creation service, and each of these entities will have various properties and tags that can be used to pattern match against future requests. That means for example if you possibly steal something from a shop or try to mug somebody and security gets called in dynamically, there's a chance the same security officer may bust you later or get called in for back up at a traffic stop.<br/><br/>Given the scope of the world we are trying to create it would be actually impossibly to simulate all their schedules and every detail of their life, but we can split the difference by using a combination of dynamic creation, virtual simulation, and pattern matched reuse to bring the kind of gameplay you are looking for.<br/><br/>Spawn closets/spawn lockers are simply a way to get entities into/out a place, but they aren't the progenitus of that entity in our game world, instead the character archetype system is what will track these, so their scheduler may have them board a train, go to work, come back, get dinner, go to sleep etc.. and yes in some of those movement points there maybe be a spawn locker involved, but it doesn't mean that every NPC you see is only probabilistic. The idea is that quanta and the other systems like the dynamic mission system will be able to use spawn lockers to facilitate to help move entities throughout the world, and when there are surges necessary (security backup etc...) have a way to get NPCs in the necessary areas without breaking immersion.<br/><br/>Also keep in mind the spawn lockers won't be the only way this can happen, as when you're out in the middle of space or in a random area on a planet other mechnisms can be used, like QT spawned NPCs or drop ships.", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/50259/thread/will-monster-lockers-be-used-to-fake-it-in-the-lon/3466605", "user": "Cintara", "title": "Ask The Devs", "type": "spectrum", "published_at_timestamp": 1603065600}, {"objectID": "954043001", "title": "Star Citizen: Calling All Devs - Talking Ship", "source": "https://youtu.be/ape3xSoHD4M", "type": "youtube", "question": "What is the state of the Redeemer?", "answer": "", "time": "15m9s", "published_at_timestamp": 1600992000}, {"objectID": "1f9c798a4b57d1_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Yes.

So you are definitely going to see Nyx. We are going to put it in, in short term the Stanton system. So you will see the landing environments like Nyx, all debuting with the procedural planets sort of iteration of Stanton so that's kind of what we've been working on which is one of the reasons why you haven't seen much updates. The landing area and environment is done, but now it's all about integrating it into the big huge star system and the whole, how it gets integrated into the planetary tech and how that streams as you arrive to it so it's all seamless, there's no loading screens.So we're all actually quite hard at work doing that so I think that's what you will be seeing, you'll basically see Nyx with 2.7 and then we'll carry on to expand beyond that. We won't have ArcCorp in with 2.7, but not too far past that, then you'll actually have ArcCorp where you'll go land on the planet in the system and not have to go to a separate load screen. So the whole goal to get to, you just enter the PU or the mini pu and you fly around between landing locations whether they're on planets, whether they're space stations and you do your missions, you trade, you make some money, upgrade your ship and that's the core game loop of course that we've talked about with Star Citizen.

So when they move your IFCS will track that and move to accommodate. It will require a friendly IFCS handshake, so you won't be able to use this to make dogfighting disappear. What it will do though is allow you to make complicated flying formations by moving only relative to your squadmate, rather than relative to the universe. I'm sure that'll make reacting to the universe difficult, but we have a fairly broad spectrum of exactly how it's handling that frame of reference, which is something we're looking to try fairly soon to see how the game handles it.Matthew Sherman: Formations are an interesting thing, especially with something as big as SC taking into true 3D space and managing all those positions at once.CR: Even to the point of being able to communicate formation. We had a proposal for just having \"here are my wingmen spots\" so you know where to fly in order to fly with me, so you can work together a little more.

This is a very fair criticism of some of the, especially the Arena Commander, battles. What we need to do when we are refactoring each of these systems, shields is being refactored as we speak, we then need to take a balance pass and figure out what we need to do to change the min and max ranges of each of the values in the system.So for example, with the shields we are going to introduce gameplay in which you can do things like give priority to a certain shield; or change the way it can repair faces faster; or do shield face hardening; or the way in which faces can absorb damage or deflect damage away. So once we implement these systems and get that gameplay into the game then we need to go and sit with each of the ships and start shooting at the ship, figuring out \"okay, well ships of this size with this particular shield can withstand this much damage for this amount of time\" and put that all in a big chart and then figure out where each of the ship lies and if we need to tweak any changes.So to answer you question, we do need to better balance passes for each of our systems. Making hulls and shields across the board larger may not be the best way to do that.DV: We want to have more tactical combat rather than just overall buffs.KT: Sure, and so what we can do is, we can take a look at each of the systems individually,  shields, hull, health, mass, damage per second, by weapon type, etc. and figure out \"okay, where in the realm of the things that we want to look at, like DPS for weapons, where does that particular weapon sit? Where should it sit?\" If it isn't sitting in the right place we figure out \"okay, we need to tweak these particular values and make sure that they do fit a role for that particular component type.So yes we want to make gameplay more interesting. We will do that with balance. I think this will definitely come into play as we start making larger and larger ships because as we do implement ships, or ship types, that we haven't before we need to figure out \"okay, how do we do this without breaking what already exists?\" So if we make, say, the Constellation, if we made it impossible to destroy with a couple of Hornets it wouldn't be very fun. So figuring out where, again, the ship lies; where the capability of each of its systems types should lie and ensuring that those values are correct is part of our jobs and we need to be better at that.DV: At the same time let's look at real world analogies or comparisons: if you have two people on motorcycles that crash into each other at high speed chances are they're both going to get wrecked. Pretty quickly. If you have a car hit a motorcycle the chances are the car will be a little dented but the motorcycle will be pretty totalled.KT: It's true. We still need to, as game designers, we still need to figure out a way in which that is fun.DV: Yeah. Absolutely. So you don't want it to be over quickly but you still want to add an element of adrenalin pumping with tactical strategies.KT: Right. So that also comes into play when we're designing ships. We can't make a ship that is just OP, in which playing any other ship types is just no fun.DV: Right.KT: So we figure out how is it better than other ships, yet consider if you have a fleet of smaller ships can they take it out? Let's figure out a way we can do that.DV: Ultimately just establishing a really good strong meta for the combat.KT: Yeah.", "published_at_timestamp": 1456181823, "question": "What are your thoughts on massively increasing the hull and shields on all ships equally across the board?

How do you manage to sync the work done by the different studios that are probably also in different time zones?", "answer": "Lisa Ohanian: This is a really good question, and actually one of our biggest challenges. So, when we're deciding what work needs to be done for something, take Gamescom for example, we try to divvy up work in a way that makes sense. We're not going to have an artist and a designer for the same ship working in tandem while one's in the UK and one's here, because it just, they can't communicate, they can't have that back-and-forth.Darian Vorlick: Logistically, it's impossible.LO: They don't necessarily know the status of everything, and it takes 8 hours to find out the answers to basic questions that might be blocking you. So, we really try and be smart about when we're breaking up the work. There were a lot of ships... again for example Gamescom, UK did a lot of the large world tech, and a lot of the infrastructure for what you saw at the demo, and they had been working on some of the art for a lot of the ships, and they have the bandwidth of course, and the talent, to have done a great job with the tech setup and everything for the ships, but since we knew they needed to work on it, they just handed all of the ships off at a certain part, when the art was done, for us to do tech setup. Because that's a very clean breaking point. There are parts in the ship pipeline where everything is intertwined and things are just coming in everywhere, but that actually, when they handed things off was a very clean breaking point to give to us, and we had all of the context just from looking at the files to finish everything up. It made sense for us to take on those ships because we would have everyone locally working on these essentially mini-features, and they could all focus on what they were going to need to interact with the most, between each other.DV: On the flip side of that, there's a lot of times where there is a lot of international collaborations. Steven Humphreys, from the UK office, is one of our engineers, and what happened, he would work on part of this GOST system, and every day the design and engineering team would have a series of handoff emails where we would send an email at the end of our day to the UK office on what's in progress, how much progress has been done, what's been completed, what bugs have been fixed, and so then the UK would use that as a point of departure for what they needed to continue off of, or what they've started, at the end of their day, they send us another handoff email, and that gives us an idea of what they did. So with GOST, whatever Stephen Humphreys had worked on, whatever he'd finished after that, the email would reach us, and then Kirk, Dan, Mark Abent, would then pick up from there, so they would get the emails for what stuff on GOST had been completed, and they'd be able to run with the ball until the end of our day. So, there is a lot of international collaboration, it just depends entirely on what that feature is. Some of it doesn't require collaboration at all.LO: And while it makes sense with the time too, we also just to piggyback on that, that was a really good point, we have our CG supervisor, Forrest, who's been really championing us getting more detail into our bug tickets and our database, and that way you can not only go to someone and look them up and say, this is what they're working on, but you can go in there and you can see what sub parts of it are finished and what aren't, how many hours is the task going to be, how many they've logged so far, and this is completely invaluable between studios when you want to see how things are progressing and when you can task your developers appropriately.DV: Ideally, through JIRA, whenever a developer leaves a comment on what work they did, if another developer opened up that ticket or that task, they'd just see everything, read that comment, they should be able to pick up where the last one left off.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 11", "source": "https://youtu.be/9y1X4tLFdU0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Acaro", "published_at_timestamp": 1439849467}, {"objectID": "373682340", "question": "When delays occur in the production stream such as what's happened with Star Marine, what are the producers at CIG doing to minimize it's effect on the overall schedule of the game's development? I'm aware that various modules are being run in parallel to help offset this, but are there other specific things that are being done that we may not be aware of?", "answer": "Travis Day: So, this is actually a really good question for Sean Tracy, Jeremy Masker... These are guys I am constantly having discussions with, sometimes arguments with, about what is the best way to offset and mitigate the risk that this will delay other streams.Eric Kieron Davis: Healthy argument.TD: We do have healthy arguments - you know I think that's another thing that's important in production is you have to be super open to: 'My idea is not always the best idea.' - and everybody needs to be that way in game development in general and it's kind of... to borrow a term from our old friends at Activision: \"It's the battle for the best idea.\" And it really is true. I love having those conversations because you may think you're right but then you get into it and... ahh okay, that's a better solution.Anyways, back to your question. The real point of this is... yes. What we do is have an interesting stream and branch structure. So, you talk about main is like the main code stream... and actually that's really no longer the case for us... we do most of our game development in... it can be best described in two pyramids - one an inverted pyramid and one below it, a regular pyramid. In the middle sits Main and below that we have Game Dev, so we have Game Dev FPS, Game Dev AC, Game Dev Social, Game Dev... and that's where each of the teams works in their own little discrete area. Now, there's a bunch of intermediate streams that are constantly synchronizing with one another and what this does is if two guys in two different streams work on the same file, it will push into here, they'll integrate with one another, they'll send an e-mail to both of them saying, \"Resolve this. Make sure this comes together in a clean way,\" and everything that is clean, stable, and beautiful - theoretically - then propagates up to main. Then it's from main that we'll branch out to do a release so the where we get to the upper pyramid is when we say: \"Hey, we want to release Star Marine.\" Which... we've said we want to release Star Marine... because we do. So, we then create a branch above that that is the Star Marine release branch and this is what will end up going to Public. So, that is created off of main which theoretically - with the system that's going on in the lower pyramid in that ecosystem - remains pretty stable and we do final polish, bug fixing, and much to Sean's chagrin... maybe some feature development, in that release stream which is then later integrated backwards once we release down through the whole tree structure again. So this is the technical structure of how we've arrayed our Perforce to try to mitigate the impact that one release has on another.But then there are also, you know, kind of social, psychological, or marketing impact that it does have, where you want to try to space out your releases a little bit to give a release time to breathe, to give the team focus and time to focus on that release and make sure that they support it after its release and everything else so in that way you do kind of want to space out your releases a little bit or else you're going to burn everybody on the team out and divide the focus.Do you have anything to add on that?EKD: [laughs] No. You mastered that one. That was great. I don't have anything to add... I think that what we try to mitigate is any individual module impacting the other module negatively. I think that's really what we're talking about and so as producers we are trying to find ways, as Travis has done excellently over the years, of trying to find ways to... \"How can we keep pushing down this module so we can not impact each other?\"TD: That's a really good point too that you make... it does happen. We're just trying to minimize. A lot of things in production are: \"I can't promise it's not going to happen but I can try to minimize it happening and minimize the impact that it happening makes.\"EKD: Yeah, and having as many plans in our back pockets as we can. Right, like... here's the plan we're all shooting for... but here's our other 10 plans we have in the back pocket in case things... that we have in the back of our heads or part of our schedules, for sure.TD: Thank you, good question.EKD: Yeah, great!", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 08 (2015.06.22)", "source": "https://youtu.be/m5eFAdJXXSE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Amontillado", "published_at_timestamp": 1435010541}, {"objectID": "233f4ae916416_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "No, the refueling equipment can be operated internally.

Do you draw them from the inside out, or from the outside in?", "answer": "Elwin Bachiller: That's a good question.  So far we have done it simultaneously.  So a lot of  the ships, the Merlin's a great example, I did the modelling for the exterior, where Paul Forgi, which is another artist, is working on the cockpit, and he's continuing to work on it now.  So basically what we do is we define our boundaries, and we say hey, don't cross this boundary or you're starting to clip into the exterior, or on my end, don't cross this or I'm clipping into the interior, so we basically just define the line.  We draw the line in the sand and say, don't go over that side.  And then we can basically work in isolation in our different scenes, and we'll go back and forth daily just to make sure things are working properly, but that's basically how we've handled it so far.Lance Powell: How do you bridge the gap?  Once you meet in the middle, how do you say pull the influence from this one into this one?EB: That's more of an organic process.  It comes down to, we're working from the same base of references to begin with, so we should already be starting in a good place to begin with.  then what happens is it depends on what's going ot be leading the charge in terms of the shape language.  SO if the exterior's going to be leading the charge, which in a lot of ways it usually is, that will then influence how the interior must change its shape languages, so it looks like it fits.  It's an organic process.  I'll do something and I'll say Paul, what do you think of this, and if he likes it, cool, lets make this change to the interior so it fits with the exterior, and we'll go back and forth.LP: What phases do you go through, to get them done?EB: So, ideally, the process is we get a concept done, generally we have a couple of concept artists in house, but a lot of our concepts are getting done out of house with outsourcing, david hobbins, doing some great stuff.  He basically defines what the ship looks like and if it meets all the gameplay requirements, then it becomes a process of getting that concept to work in game.  IN situations where that isn't such a smooth transition, cause for gameplay reasons things don't actually work or we have to make changes, at that point we have to pivot and say, okay, we'll start doing some concept ourselves.  And at that point, it's us, re-concepting certain sections, making sure it works, sometimes it leads to an almost complete redo of certain ships, and then we'll go to the full modelling process where we basically do all of our geometry, after we do that we'll do something called custom normals, which basically makes our geo look better without using as much geo, so it's a cheaper way of making our ships look betterLP: Circling back to our first questionEB: Right, Then we'll go through our material pass, where we basically define what the surfaces are made of and how they look and how light reflects off of them, then we'll go through the process of making them totally destructible so that you can blow holes in all our beautiful hard work!

I had directed live action for WC3 and WC4 but a film is a whole other level of subtly and finesse.<br/><br/>2) I needed a producer that could do more than just do a good deal. I needed someone to help me on the set, to tell me hey Chris I know you want to do these 10 things but we only have money to do 5 things really well. So let's pick what they are and knock them out of the park and cut the others. This is what a strong creative producer does, and its what I've tried to do for other directors I've worked with over the last 10 years.<br/><br/>3) We had a ridiculously short pre-production timeline. The movie wasn't greenlit until December and we were in production towards the end of February - we basically had under 3 months of pre-production, which for a complicated sci-fi movie is way too short. Most films like this have 6 months, some much longer. Its why the Kilrathi and a lot of other stuff ended up being cut - we didn't get to test / work them out in pre-production, so we had to rely on what we got - and a lot of it just didn't work. Originally we had more time but when Fox signed the deal to distribute the next three Star Wars films from Lucas, they insisted that we deliver before SW Ep 1 so they could release before hand. So we were given a 1998 Dec delivery date. Given the time needed for the VFX we had to move up the shoot date.<br/><br/>4) I gave into some of the studio's casting choices. In the same situation I would not. They were very keen to bring in all the young horror fans that were seeing movies like Scream and I know what you did Last Summer - but that really wasn't the Wing Commander audience.<br/><br/>If I made the movie today it would be 10x better... I've learnt a lot over the last ten years and have matured as person / story teller.
