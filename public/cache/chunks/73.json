We've done stories about this about how the difficulties tracking digital currency across the systems when we have that lag in communications. When you have to send a comm-array. So if you buy something at this convenience store in this system to notify your bank that you spent that money the trip that information takes and how they handle with local relay stations.So we've been talking about what did those currency chips may look like what are you collecting when you find currency. So there might actually be physical currency that you come around which are basically not transferrable data things that get stocked around versus kind of wiring and those would be potentially more reliable in systems without comm-arrays versus the more central areas where you can hook into the Spectrum and transfer it that way.JL: That is interesting. What if I bought something but it's literally maybe thirty solar systems away so by the time the information had reached another solar system there might be inflation.WW: Well we did a fun story about this bank robber who was basically going to all her banks and withdrawing money at each one and racing faster than the comm relays could go and so they didn't know she had already withdrawn her money in the previous banks which was really fun. So we have built in safeties so that you can't do that now.But we're going to have to explore that hopefully in 2.0 the Social Module and the alpha getting some form of expenditure once the stores are online we can start seeing how currency works more from the design aspect and we'll update the lore to address the needs and concerns about how people are interacting with the credits in game.

Does a lot of talk between each department happen or is it just tossed back and forth till it's perfect and not something completely different from the original.", "answer": "Eric Kieron Davis: What I love about this question is, it's happening. We kind of talked about the pipeline a little bit but we didn't touch on older ships. We didn't talk about, we talked a little about the constellation. Do you go this ship isn't what we originally planned, hey guys let's talk about, or is it tech is the new thing? What normally happens?Forrest Stephan: Usually the first thing that we do is we look at the one of the legacy ships and there's some obvious fixes that we need to do, make it more modular right? standardize the parts that are inside the ship, that way we have an external library we can pull from so if you have a seat and a joystick, instead of building it unique to one ship, we keep that sort of separate and that's a thing now that we can potentially put in other ships.We also learned very early that we had to standardize all of our interface as you're sitting in the cockpit. Create templates and create kind of proxy examples of animation works because we can't have an unlimited amount of animations so it has to be fairly reusable from ship to ship and we kind of started targeting in on individual manufacturers so each manufacture has kind of a specific layout that's kind of consistent throughout the ships.The other thing is we obviously have switched a lot of our tech. we went from the traditional unwraps and doing textures from scratch to doing more of a tiling system. Obviously with physically based renderer came on we had to start converting the ships over to the new rendering system which required us to update all of our textures and all of our materials so that's still kind of a big challenge and were still porting over the ships from that system and we have stuff like the Argo system that's starting to get standardized which now we had to update all of our cargo holds to actually support the new designs, which you know the constellation is the best example of taking a legacy ship and now bringing it into our next gen pipeline.You know everything from the seats to the interface to the cargo system, to the materials, to our modeling techniques, and the reusability and to the modular aspects, and then the gameplay requirements so that was kind of a big chunk that was required and we decided to tackle that and it took some time but now that we have all these system in place, it ended up being a very good example for what we needed to do for some smaller ships.EKD: Is it all generally system or have you guys gotten involved later to reimagine a ship?Adam Wieser: I think while I've been here the biggest thing has been more about the components you use in the ship is that there is a really long list of components different manufacturers that have been created in lore that we realized there were a lot of double, triples, that maybe just for simplicity sake, if we kind of tried to pair those down so it was just easier for the designer, for the artists like oh it's going to be this one manufacturer that produces this one thing, we don't need 40 different company making shield generators., we can have the standard few that has their obvious pros and cons.That's been a big thing, sometimes there are ships that we've had ideas form that we want to be able to work on but maybe some of the thing stuff that you guys are doing kind of affects that, oh we're going to have to make sure that this one feels distinct enough and it's not just a copy of this to a certain degree.EKD: Yeah it's really interesting and from the scheduling side, from the production side, were always looking at what's next, what makes sense because we have a limited amount of resources right? We're all a resource at this company so it's always like well, we'd love to get back and redo some of these older ships but we don't have bandwidth because we really want to get onto the new ships it's always kind of a balancing act, something that we just become passionate about because we've been really looking at it for 3 years and some were like we'll get back to it, it's really more important to get onto to these items.Calix Reneau: It's also as features come online.EKD: Yes exactly.CR: Like there's more thing to refactor, we can go back and make the aurora series up to current systems but the time it will take to do that, we will have another system up so we'll need to do it again. So to a certain extent we have to look at how of out of date things are versus how much we'd be able to bring them up to speed and how much were still building the game to be.FS: We want to minimize how much we, we don't want to rebuild the ship from complete scratch, there's some situations that we kind of have to but for the most part, for me the most important thing really is the efficiency and optimization of it and a lot of the reasons we've had to go back to older ships and we still need to go back to some older ships like the cutlass because when we originally built them, we build them like a game model and now we have all this tech that takes advantage of certain approaches, we need to go back and abide by those approaches to make it efficient for the game because obviously having these extremely expensive ships in the game hurts performance and after we kind of initially started getting stuff out there we were like we gotta make this game run well because people are going to be today and they aren't going to be playing when it theoretically come out you know years down the road.You actually you know, we had to decide a year or two years ago we need to figure out the most efficient way to make these ships because this is going to be important because this thing needs to sustain for a long period of time. and also you know I'm not real big in completely redesigning the old ships, i think it's kind of cool, it's kind of like a classic car, you know I'd rather see a new model of the ship, get it efficent, get it using all the systems work the design and not do too much to it right and then create a new version of the ship right that's a new model like a car you know what I mean and when you see someone flying around in that 2014 model, you know it's kind of special.[Everyone agrees in approval]EKD: Because you could even break this down in a production standpoint, we just have a rebuilding team right? and then we have the team that's building the ships that we all want to see that we've have been talking about, then we have the live time. We have several different kinds of games happening all at the same place with the same resources and I think that always comes down to pros and cons, what do we want to see before other things and so on and so on.", "title": "10 for the All-Stars: Episode 01", "source": "https://youtu.be/lkaYT3_vXWQ", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "CC Corp", "published_at_timestamp": 1445291582}, {"objectID": "373681030", "question": "When we reach a point where the ability to shop at ArcCorp is enabled, will the Voyager Direct store be closing down?", "answer": "So as far as the Voyager Direct store...we'll definitely transfer across the buying and selling of in game stuff that you would normally buy with in game UEC as much as possible. There may be some level of stuff that for a short period of time we keep on Voyager Direct it depends on which shops come online sooner or later. As soon as we have proper shops in the Star Citizen alpha that are connected to the persistent database and the transactions are safe and what not and we don't have any worries about them being breached, abused. Then we would get rid of the online Voyager Direct UEC store because the UEC should really be currency you use in the game and then you would real cash currency on the normal pledge store on the site where you first buy your package to come and enter the game or where you would buy some additional UEC if you didn't want to be earning it inside the game. One aspect that we haven't one hundred percent decided on is in the case of the SC alpha you're running around and we're still testing stuff, we've been toying with the idea that you're earning money during that time so you can buy things with the in game shop so that will be one thing that we do maybe not at the beginning but we'll bring that in but we'll probably make all that stuff that you do during that alpha phase be money that once we go commercial ok that will go away. obviously the money you've earned with your package or bought with real dollars would be permanent for you but any money you earned during the alpha stage would only be around for as long as the alpha stage is around or when we wipe it,  there may even be a couple of times when we wipe it where we have our large test map SC alpha 1.3 that we have right now that goes on for a while and at some point we will go we're going to shift to the proper system is inside the SC universe we'll start with one system and then open to another and so on and at that point we may even do a temporary stuff that you've earned to a new temporary UEC until the final this is Star Citizen for everybody and then its fresh start.

If we support left handed vs right handed in the end we'll shift it over, but for the mean time no. It'd be too many different model and animation sets to handle for the short term, if it becomes important down the line we might. Generally when it's projected, it'll project in front of you anyway then you'd interact, a bit like an iPhone being held up and interacted with. Imagine it like that, but with a \"Google Glass\" style augmented reality eyepiece as well, but you bring up the \"iphone\" do do the actual buying of things.

As you said in Arena Commander you can switch out your weapons and missiles fairly quickly. So on a bigger ship, y'know I am not sure if we're going to keep it at that level of speed or perhaps you say, \"I want to reconfigure my Retaliator into this type of setup.\" And they say, \"Okay that's fine and it will take about a day.\" So we haven't made a decision on that. The default will probably be the plug and play approach, but that's sort of a game mechanic and a gameplay decision that is sort of being put off until we sort out what feels right. There's sort of pros and cons, you don't want it to feel 100% realistic for say unloading cargo and that sort of thing. You want to get back out into space, so if you have a space that's been beaten up pretty badly in real-life that might take months to fix but you don't want your ships to be out for months. You probably want to have some amount of time it takes to get fixed, but not months. You might take a little more to switch out parts that modular but it would not be equivalent to what it would be in real-life. It would probably be enough time you take a walk around, get a drink at the bar, and do a few other things in the interim.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 49 (2014.12.22)", "source": "https://youtu.be/rFfzlZ4bL8I", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Jacknife", "published_at_timestamp": 1419289210}, {"objectID": "373678250", "question": "How will customizing a new ship in the PU work?

Also you'll be able to work on the paint schemes and decals, we're actually working on that tech right now which we'll be debuting. not in 13.2 but definitely in V1.0 of AC that allows a base paint tech that we'll use for that. You won't necessarily be able to create the scheme yourself at first, more like base colour/secondary colour etc, but later on there's potentially the support for you to do your own particular paint-job or skin, as well as placing decals. Not sure if we'll have the user's ability to change colour schemes in the first iteration of V1.0, but we'll have some different skins there to select.

And of course if you're doing it with a rare ship and there's not any of those ships in production nearby, then it takes you some time to get the new ship. So we're not- ... the idea is it shouldn't be really easy for you to do a lot of ramming in your ship. It should be a bit of a pain in the ass, and the more you do, maybe you have to wait a little longer, and if you do WAY too much of it, maybe there won't be any ships in that star system and you'll have to wait 'til one gets shipped in from another star system. So that's kinda the idea. We probably will want to have some other features there to stop people just being obnoxious, but we're still trying to think through all that sort of stuff, so we'll see what happens.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 35 (2014.08.25)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Uyur8rqbEHc", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "GhG", "published_at_timestamp": 1409004035}, {"objectID": "373683920", "question": "With the release of AC, can we get and update on the progress of TrackIR integration?And I was also wondering the reason behind supporting the Rift (which is only in a dev built currently) before that of the TrackIR, which is released and available to all?", "answer": "We have TrackIR on the schedule, and we have an engineer who works on it when he has a chance.The Rift support's really, to be honest with you, it's sort of like a team passion. We've got a fair number of people who are VR, VR-heads, let's put it that way. And they were so excited by the Rift that in a lot of ways they spent extra time to try and get stuff working, because they just wanted to see what it was like on the Rift.So that's really why it was supported early, because for me, my focus is really to get the game out in the hands of everyone in the base model.The Rift's cool, but obviously there aren't that many people who have it, so that's not really the priority, but it ended up happening because we've got some people who are very passionate about it, and in some ways, maybe more passionate than they are about TrackIR.But TrackIR is absolutely on the schedule, and I actually think in some ways it can be, especially for aiming and looking around, it's great.And in some ways, if you don't want to have a headset on you, it's kind of nice. The headset can be pretty claustrophobic, and the rift itself has got loads of potential, but it's still got a ways to go. The resolution's too low, even on DK2, which is 1080p, because it's right next to your eyes, so you can see the pixels. You really need at least 1080p on each eye probably.I know the Oculus folks are working on trying to get more resolution. The Crystal Cove prototype, which actually has positional head tracking, will make it better. So it's got a huge amount of potential, but it's still got a ways to go.Anyway, those are the reasons, some passionate devs, not any sort of cunning marketing plan or anything.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 25.

(Big cheers to Chris Smith.)", "answer": "Well we listen to all you guys, we read the forums, and when things make sense to us.It's not really a democracy in terms of \"There's a bunch of people saying this, so we should do it,\" it's more that \"someone's making a good point,\" alright, we'll listen to that. And that's the value of the community, and I think what's really making Star Citizen great. Then we enact it. So we're, for instance, making some changes to the Constellation, for better cargo access, loading/unloading, and also using the Merlin fighter so they're not interfering with each other and not blocking each other. Also moving up living quarters closer to the cockpit.Those were all things that were discussed by the community, and we're like \"yeah, that makes a lot of sense,\" and we can see those problems. The 300i, I'm not quite sure what people were discussing in the community, but we're making some changes 'cause it's getting another pass.As you've seen, the Hornet has continually had improvements. The cockpit, people used to complain that there wasn't enough visibility, well actually the seat's a little higher now, the struts are a lot thinner, there's a lot more detail in them too, so you really feel the high fidelity of the environment that we're going for.And we're doing the same for the 300i, it needs a bit of love and an up-res. So we're definitely up-resing the cockpit, and we've up-resed the exterior.And the one last thing that we've really got to figure out is the cargo, 'cause there's not a lot of space for cargo in the design even though it's meant to be able to pull some cargo. We're in the process of that, I think we're leaning towards being able to have an attachable cargo module on the outside, but that's still in the works.", "title": "10 for the Chairman Episode 17 .

We're definitely going to have another UEE fighter craft. We're still in the process of finding that out.We obviously have a couple of military spec bombers that we've talked about, one is the Gladiator, one is the Retaliator, and right now we only have one dogfighter. Obviously it's kind of a multi-role fighter, which is really what an F-18 is, but I think you would probably have a more space superiority fighter, and maybe even a lighter design than the Hornet.So yes, there will be more, and stay tuned.
