So those had to work a long time ago and they have been working for quite some time.<br /><br />Where the difficulty comes is in implementing a player character as a female because when you implement an AI, as any character for that matter, he doesn\u2019t have to do as much as a player does; if anything half as much as a player does in terms of animation sets, logic \u2013 he doesn\u2019t need to be dynamically updating his loadout, he doesn\u2019t decide to do these certain things. There\u2019s a lot of things the AI don\u2019t do that the player has to do.<br /><br />Additionally you have to solve things like the camera offset, weapon offset, weapons have to fit in female hands nicely, it has to look the same from a first person perspective and then on top of all of that you\u2019ve got to think about gameplay balance within the two. So hitboxes, ugh hitboxes, I hate saying hitboxes, the Physics of the skeleton that gets impacted need to be the same or at least balanced between the two sexes as we don\u2019t want anyone min-maxing. I don\u2019t want anyone selecting a female just for the sake of a less big target for example.<br /><br />So we\u2019ve had the rig online for quite some time now and what we\u2019ve wanted to do was finalise our male set completely because conceptually you don\u2019t actually want to re-author 6000 animations for the female. But to be fair because we have a separate skeleton for the female we want to feminise a lot of those motions but there\u2019s so many motions that don\u2019t necessarily have to be feminised because a female won\u2019t necessarily aim down the gun sights differently than a male does for example. But, you know in walking we have different walk gaits so that should look different.<br /><br />So what we wanted to do is bring the male completely finalised; everything is done so we never have to go back and keep re-working. And once we\u2019re really done with the male we\u2019ll run those animations through some tools onto our female, we\u2019ll feminise a few of them which make sense to feminise and then we\u2019ll release it.

AI is one of the bits I try to give an update on and I know it's fairly high level on the AtV every week but I try to give an idea of what the guys are pushing on and what they're working on. There is an overall large amount going on with AI right now, with subsumption system and how we're making sure that things are set out today that are going to be best used for the future, right.We need to take the time, it's in everyone's best interest to build a strong a foundation as we can on things like AI so that can set us up to handle things we want to implement, you know, in the next few months, in the next six months. Even ideas we have that are, you know, loose on paper that we wouldn't want to put in once the game is already out and mature, stuff that we'd still like to push on that we think would be cool for players.So, we actually have here recently it's coming up not to date this video but it's going to come up in the next few days, where I think we're going to have nine different people out here to Frankfurt office including Tony from Austin and Chris and Sean Tracey, so on, so on and so on. A good amount of people from the UK, with a large amount of discussion based on AI.

So , we were kind of tracking that over the past few months, dropping hints about it and over the past month we've kind of gone pretty hard on showing everyone the ins and outs of that race and the different candidates in it.That includes a poll which was I think a few weeks prior, it was just supposed to... it was written in kind of like this is a poll you would normally send to kind of citizens of a world and asking them their thoughts on a wide variety of questions. Many of you did vote in that and to be quite honest, much like the poll we did on the Polo Initiative a few months ago, we did absolutely take into consideration the way everyone voted and it's something we plan to continue to do and hope to continue to do.We love the participation that you guys give in your responses or in the kind of like role playing that sometimes occurs on the forums or even in the comment thread of the post. So yeah, it's not just something we're doing for the sake of doing it, we're actually looking at how you respond we're taking that into consideration and I know some things have even adjusted because of the way you have voted. Sometimes we have ideas of where we want to take something but we see how you vote and we're like, 'huh, that's interesting to see people concerned about this or kind of focused on that or arguing for this'.It's definitely something we like to do and it's definitely something we want to more because anytime we can get you coming in and, you know, being a part of this world with us, it just makes it a better and richer environment for us to create in. So, it's pretty cool and lot of fun to do.Omar Aweidah: That's the best part is like talking to everybody and seeing how everybody interacts and kind of making the universe live with the actual citizens, you know, and the subscribers and everything. It makes it fun and it makes it a world.AW: This process it's something where no one person is creating this, we're all a part of this and it's all bigger than what's immediately at your hands. So, you fans are part of that process so having your input in polls and votes is from our perspective just extremely valuable and awesome on our front.OA: Let's not have a Tavarian for president, that's blasphemy.AW: We'll have to see.OA: It has to be human.

I think you guys have noticed that we just had the initial council originally then we now have a bug reporting system and we're constantly looking at ways to make it a lot more efficient. Recently we're trying to tier and structure our testing a little more so we can have some very, very early testers because  a lot of times we want very targeted testing which is for, \"Okay let's do a stress test and we need 24 people in 10 instances all right now at this particular time\" and not everyone out there in our community is ready or willing to do that or ready and willing to put up with all the bugs and issues and problems that comes with that.We're working on lining up our testing to be able to sort of do some very targeted specific testing, some very early testing as well as the next stage of testing which is a wide degree, that's the normal PTU where it's 5,000 people and then we go out to live which is still really testing, but it's out to all you guys. Also, don't forget there are going to be some things that we have to test that we absolutely don't want, even if we're getting you guys to help us, the people that are helping us are going to have to be quiet about it.For instance when we start to get people to start to help out with some more expanded Squadron 42 testing, we absolutely don't want anything to leak there so that's all the reasons why we're building up these different groups of testers to be more efficient that way and on top of that it's how to make the Issue Council better is an ongoing task. We think it works really well, it can definitely be better, but I think it's gonna be one of the foundations that long term will make Star Citizen what it will be because we're having this amazing resource of all you guys hammering on the game, trying all these different things and so it's impossible for our internal tester to cover a whole bunch of the stuff you guys do.All the work, blood, sweat, and tears; bluescreens of death, crashes that you guys go through now will just make the final product all that much better, so thank you for all that and yes we will be trying to make things better on the issue council as we go forward.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 83", "source": "https://youtu.be/vJoHlCc4Y7E", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Sir Vulpecula", "published_at_timestamp": 1461010317}, {"objectID": "373682570", "answer": "Sean Tracy: Yeah, this is a really good question, and on the character height we're looking at different things, whether you're wearing high-heels or boots or something like this, of course we want the height to change a little bit, but again it's, it's a bit of a tricky thing without changing the skeleton itself. Now, on character width, and having some targets for you know a fatter guy or a thin guy, the CryEngine used to have, and blame Crytek for this one, used to have the ability to have thin / fat variations, this was something way back in Crysis 1.Steve Bender: Vert colors.ST: Exactly. So, there used to be a, I think it was eight different channels of Vert colors, and in our character editor we could actually select each one of those channels, and for example, the upper arm would be the blue channel, the lower arm would be the green channel, the midriff would be the red channel, so you would just select that particular channel, and you had two variants, so you had a really fat mesh, a normal guy, and then a really thin mesh, and you could just have a slider that actually deformed between them, that would adjust, but, again, and blame character artists at Crytek, more specifically.SB: Definitely blame those character artists, those [BEEP] [BEEP].ST: Basically [BEEP] [BEEP] what happened was that the way we controlled that was through vertex colors, the problem for the character artists was they want to use the vertex colors for vertex colors. They want to actually be able to do the art with the vertex colors rather than using them just as a mask, so that sort of functionality was removed from the engine a little while ago. Now. What're we working on to actually do that? With our character customizer that we're working on right now, what I want is the ability to have little control points basically that you will control whether it's symmetrical or not, different areas of the mesh, so the midriff, the chest, the shoulders, the arms, the triceps, all these sorts of areas and we're trying a whole bunch of different control points around the character to see how much we want to expose, and how much we don't want to. So we could go to town on this, we could have 100's of different control points, but I mean at what point is it too much right? So you will have the ability to adjust your character, adjust your characters body, to what degree, I can't really say yet, because well, we're trying a whole bunch of it, and sooner rather than later you guys will see it.SB: Yeah, we're also working on animations for these sorts of things, so the animations that you see right now for your characters in say the persistent universe are the base locomotion set, and what we're planning on doing, and we're actively working on this right now, is creating variants based off of that, so we'll have, depending upon what your character is like, maybe he's a little bit more macho, or something like that, you'll be able to customize that portion of your character too, as certain variations in animation sort of give you that, what, that kind of personalized feeling for who your guy is.ST: Right, right, cause you might want to have a different attitude, you might stand different....SB: Yeah, exactly. I always stand like this. [leans seductively]ST: I just stand like this [manly pose] but I'm not flexing, I'm not flexing...SB: Oh, damn. You've been working out.ST: mmMMmm. Little bit.SB: Alright. So.ST: Not really, actually, I haven't been working out at all. I don't think I've worked out in [BEEP] three years. Oh, whoa, PG. beep beep.SB: Beep beep, beep beep. I walk 3.2 miles every day to work. And then 3.2 miles back.ST: Are you serious?SB: Yeah.

It will probably be a case of you'll not be able to get enough friends to manage a ship with you. Obviously not a Constellation but when we get up to an Idris you'll probably would want to have some NPC crew members. They will be running AI just like the same way we would run AI in Sq 42 AI; running a big NPC or AI ship. They won't be as self aware as a real player would be. You would have to be more specific for instance in tasking them \"You are now the gunner you need to do this\" They won't be thinking ahead the same way a real person would, but they will fill the various roles effectively depending on their ratings. The more experienced crew members will be better than a rookie would. Then of course the more experienced folks would cost more to pay because none of these NPCs are going to be working for free, so you will have to pay for your crew and make sure they are taken care of. You will be hiring folks whether it's to help run the ship you're flying or fly escort with you, that's actually going to be a large part of the game. I've mentioned before a nine to ten goal ratio between AI and real life players in the world and we'll scale that way. So just in general nine out of ten people you meet will probably be an AI and the last one would be a real person so therefore we have to make them believable and make them go about their daily activities and make them perform their jobs pretty well which is one of the big focuses Tony is making with his subsumption system for the persistant universe.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 68", "source": "https://youtu.be/FkjfyVDhzNs", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Dex", "published_at_timestamp": 1443477905}, {"objectID": "373681760", "question": "Now the the SQ42 shoot is \"in the can\", how will our characters communicate during the campaign?

So, we shot the whole SQ42 with someone playing the player, and we recorded their voice, and we recorded what their face is doing. We have plans, because you can choose who you're going to be, you can choose whether you're a male or a female, you can actually choose what you look like, so we have a whole bunch of base heads or faces that you can sort of choose and blend between, so you can sort of customize your look to how you want to look, whether you're male or female. And then we are going to do additional voice work beyond the default player character that we recorded. We'll do a female PC, and I'm also toying with the idea of having some localized, even localized accents, so imagine if you were playing the game, and you've got an English IP address, and we use the English voice pack for the player instead of the American voice pack, if you're in America. Don't know about that, but that's one of the ideas, and I think it'd be pretty cool to sort of personalize that. And of course if we did that you'd be able to choose if you want to have an English accent when you're in America, or an Australian accent, or whatever it would be. But you'll definitely hear yourself speak, and think. And if you cut out to a third person, you'd be able to see your mouth, your face.

Versus ships, versus levels, versus economy, PU, mechanics, systems; we have so many people around the globe working on this game. Everyone has their own focus, everyone has their own priorities. So we have an overall global organization and then we have within that organization we have the different  studios and then within that we have the each individual teams were on something where they're Designers, they're Artists, QA, Production, Engineers, Audio, Narrative.We have so many different aspects of this that everyone is just all over the place all the time. There's no ever a priority one thing over another. Like for instance if Crusader is broken, then that's kind of a level design but also design, but it's engineering, not so much Art so that then becomes a focus for the select people.VS: Where as the Artists will still be working on the stuff that they're already working on.RV: Yeah, yup so they don't change focus. Now if a ship is completely broken and a ship needs to be redone due to this area, whether they need to be redone for LOD's ship setup issues.VS: Or a ship setup issue, LOD's.RV: Then it's like the tech designers or artist, they're shifting over to help with this and sometimes they need engineer support. It is a case by case basis on really what the priority is and that is actually coming down from the community because every time the community, like they're yelling for something, they need something, they want something, we're taking that into account.Also the leadership team of CIG is also like \"Hey, so.\" They're kind of always playing the balance game of, \"Alright this is what the community wants and this is what they need, this is the leadership team wants and needs,\" and kind of just doing that balance game of, \"This is our priority for right now,\" and it's our priority until something else changes and we still have like schedules that we're working on, but then...VS: We still have planned feature rollouts and stuff like that as well.RV: Yeah basically.VS: It's just like you said things kind of change up midstream every now and then.RV: Yup, it is what it is.", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 05", "source": "https://youtu.be/7zK8TKfHAt0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Space Is Nice", "published_at_timestamp": 1435619444, "time": "18m16s"}, {"objectID": "fe4e91de45cad_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Under certain circumstances, the tanks can certainly explode.

Will we also see different ammo types?", "answer": "Yes, you'll see all of those, in the FPS demo there were both ballistic weapons and laser rifles. We had laser pistols and ballistic pistols (though the latter I don't believe were in the demo). If I remember correctly the outlaws had the laser rifles while the marines tended to have the ballistic weapons (Behring MP4SC I think it is). The plan is to have ballistic, multiple types of energy weapons, all sorts of other things like rail guns (which are really ballistic but with alternate method of acceleration). Basically whatever weapons you see on the ships themselves you're likely to see a scaled down version of them for first person use. There will also be more or less risk of decompression if you're, say, fighting in a space station or ship and a projectile penetrates a wall and you're not careful. That might also be a reason you'd want to use say a crossbow, which is nice and quiet and probably won't breach the hull. I think we have a good idea and selection of weapon types to choose from with their ups and downs.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 47 (2014.12.01)", "source": "https://youtu.be/E8Euwh_fPeg", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Chiyeko", "published_at_timestamp": 1417474885}, {"objectID": "373678610", "question": "While piloting within a star system, how will we know our bearing? Aside from the star map and fast-travel mechanics, will there be a galactic compass, a grid system, or possibly a X,Y,Z coordinate system to help navigate and identify direction?", "answer": "You'll definitely have a navigation star map, which will have your ship and you'll be able to set waypoints and fly to them, along with predefined waypoints of discovered locations in there. I imagine there'll be some sort of grid system, internally in-engine we have one. We're still playing with the possibility of all star systems being dynamic, so planets exist in slow orbits, so then you've got the problem of where the grid system is fixed to, the star, or one of the planets or what. We'll probably go, for ease of use, an XYZ system fixed probably to the star (or stars) and everything will be relative to that. Your nav-map is where you'd look to see all that happen. Originally we were planning static systems, so now we've got more work to do (Tony Z is deep into the system design stuff right now).", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 40 (2014.10.06)", "source": "https://youtu.be/pBWJYb2Wtg0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Marley", "time": "2m02s", "published_at_timestamp": 1412632803}, {"objectID": "373678980", "question": "You have talked about the \"Slider\" in the PU that will govern whether you prefer more PvP or PvE encounter.

Who will take precedent?", "answer": "Well that's a pretty easy one. Essentially the owner / captain of the ship settings or ratings would be the determining factor of the encounters that ship would come across when flying around in space. So if you don't really want to be fighting other players, you better not be getting on a ship where someone just likes to fight other players!

Will beta testing be implemented by module while alpha is testing other modules, or will beta be a final test of the whole package prior to release?", "answer": "Yeah... so I mean, I read this on the forums where everyone argues about what \"pre-alpha\" or \"alpha\" or \"beta\" test is. So to just give you my concept, the reason why we call Arena Commander \"pre-alpha\" is because my definition of \"alpha\", which is sort of a more standard one is, \"alpha\" is not content-complete, but generally functionality complete that you start testing. And then \"beta\" is content and functionality complete, but you're trying to fix bugs, so you're still honing and tweaking and adding stuff in alpha, but you've got pretty much all your features in, but you don't have all your content in. But in \"beta\" you have content and the features in, but you're just making sure its debugged.Therefore with Arena Commander, we're not even on Arena Commander v1.0, so you could say right now we're \"pre-alpha Arena Commander v1.0\" ... When it's 1.0 it will be \"alpha\" and then it will roll to \"beta\". But really the \"alpha\", the \"beta\" descriptions we originally had the start of the project were alpha and beta for the overall game, which means Star Citizen, the Persistent Universe, Squadron 42 - all that stuff rolled together. And so one of the reasons why we say \"pre-alpha\" on each one of the modules is because we're rolling out sections of that bigger overall game individually to sort of beat on them, test on them, get feedback, make them better. All the elements are sort of \"pre-alpha\" in all these sections, and they will all roll into an \"alpha\" that will be Star Citizen, that will roll into a \"beta\". That's kind of why we say \"pre-alpha\" versus \"alpha\" versus \"beta\", and that's kind of what the process is.So the process I can see us doing is, each of the modules gets released in a pretty rough state. Much rougher than I would ever release anything to the public normally, and much rougher than a lot of times we would release on a wide beta test just to get the stress tests, get feedback on whether things work or don't work, or see where the problems lie. So we hone those, and then of the modules themselves, we go along and it's not just, \"okay that's the final module,\" it's like, \"no, this is a set of the full feature set,\" and then we're adding more features and functionality as we go along. Which is again why I said \"pre-alpha\" because it doesn't have all the functionality. By the time we get to all the functionality being there it should be joining the other modules that have also been doing the same process, into a place where we're like \"okay, we've pretty much the alpha of Star Citizen together,\" but we're missing some of the content - say some of the planets, some of the locations, some of the ships... but all the functionality is there. Then at that point you go from the alpha to the beta once all the content is in there, then you finish the tests out, and then the game is... \"released\" or \"live\". \"Done\" is a bad word because as far as I'm concerned, as long as you guys are having a great time and we can keep a viable business going (basically paying the people working on the game) then we will continually work on Star Citizen to make it cooler, and bigger, and add more and more of the features that just would make this the \"best damn space sim ever!\"I mean, you know, there's a long way to go there, so I don't want anyone out there to think that I'm saying that's where we are now. That's just our goal and ambition. That's what we're working towards but we recognize there is a huuuuge way to get there, but we're very committed to always making the game bigger, better, all the time. That's the beauty of being online, because you can constantly be sharing it - we're sharing it right now. So I know people are always worried about things like \"feature creep\" and stuff, but look, you know, people have code they can sit and play and interact with, and as we get more of it we keep adding it, and we keep making it better. It's just an ongoing process, and I hope we'll be around long enough but it would be really interesting, in 10 years time, to see what the universe looks and feels like and what's happened in it compared to what we all talked about now. Because I definitely thing it's gonna just get cooler and bigger and better, and also take some maybe unexpected turns. You can certainly just even see the process as we go along - you can see what the Hornet looked like in the original prototype in 2012, then we did an upgrade when it went into the hangars, and now there's another upgrade that went in when we went into dogfighting. You can sort of see the constant iteration and improvement we're doing, and you guys are along for the ride, which is pretty damn cool. That's kinda one of the things I think is pretty exciting about the process we're taking. I mean it does take people to understand that this is early, it's gonna get better, and you're sort of seeing the sausage get made, but umm... it's gonna be a damn good sausage in the end!", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 31 (2014.07.28)", "source": "https://youtu.be/QWWhhg56IoM", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Algared", "time": "14m23s", "published_at_timestamp": 1406584832}, {"objectID": "373683380", "question": "With all the instancing that will be going on, what is the expectation around loading times? Is there a target amound of time to load instances that you are aiming for? I'm assuming more memory will help with this?", "answer": "The way we're building the system is, you're not really... you hopefully with not be able to perceive the loading times per se, because we're basically going to be streaming the data in and out. So right now we don't. Right now when you go into Arena Commander it loads a level and loads up the stuff in a very traditional manner, but one of the tech things that we have on our plate that's part of the package that we're moving to full double precision is also the streaming of objects into the world. So the way it's meant to work is that when you're flying around in space in your world view things just stream in and out all the time, so you have no perception of loading screens or loading time. And what we do is we sort of take advantage of, say, going into the equivalent of warp space when we're in autopilot or landing on a planet, where in those cases you're in an automated flight and you can still move around your ship or look around, but everything outside... the stars are blurring by, and we're basically dumping the old objects from the area that you're leaving and streaming the new objects into your local client machine. And then once that's happened, and after the predetermined time in \"warp space\" you'll come out. So it won't feel as much... it hopefully will not feel like a loading screen. It should all feel fairly seamless. That's the way I think it will work.I will recommend SSD. They're super cheap now. It makes all game experiences and OS much better, so I would go for that no matter what. But uhh, we'll generally try to stream everything instead of actually have separate loading screens and times.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 29.

There's no sort of artificial barrier between something you can buy with money or something you can buy with your time essentially. Time equals money, there you go. We just sort of view them as fairly interchangeable.That's how we're thinking of funding the verse, maybe it's crazy, maybe it won't bring in enough money, but I'm hoping it will, because I'm not a big fan of forced monthly subscriptions. I don't mind it being an optional thing that you do, but we'll see. Our goal is to have something that's strong enough, that brings in enough money, to allow us to continue to add features, build out the universe, you know, we've talked about things like procedural generation, all this kind of stuff, and also a high level of interaction with the players and make them part of the universe and react to the actions that they do. All that will require a decent size team even after we go gold.This is an online game so it's much more a, I know it's a \"trendy\" thing to say now, but it's more a game as a service than a one-off game that you'll play for a week and then put on your shelf. So for us, it's pretty important to, right now, make sure that we've got enough money to make it, which you guys have been so generous and helped us do. We've got a great amount of money and more comes in, which is great, 'cause that just allows us to do more stuff and make it bigger and better 'cause that's our goal, to just make this as cool as possible.And then after we have all the features are in and working, you can fly fully around the universe and do all the rest of the stuff, then hopefully continued revenue comes in and allows us to just continue to build it and expand it, which is pretty much what you've seen on things like EVE Online or World of Warcraft, so hopefully we can be in, if we're lucky enough, we can be in that situation and just keep on building this really cool universe together.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 22.
