The Kingship is the largest type of Vanduul capital asset encountered and is the most powerful class of known warship. Functionally, a Kingship is a dreadnought, fleet carrier, command and control ship and assault transport combined in a single hull. They are very rarely seen, and have only been observed during large-scale Vanduul raids. When present, they operate with a large number of other craft, including ships of the line, support vessels and screens of skirmishers. Xeno-anthropologists believe that the possession of a Kingship is a powerful symbol in Vanduul martial culture, signifying a Clan's power and strength.</p><br/><h1>CONSTRUCTION</h1><br/><p>While the method of a Kingship's construction is unclear, based on scans of the ships and evidence collected from raid sites, they seem to have been built in zero gravity environments with the aid of advanced technology. Kingship silhouettes can differ from Clan to Clan, suggesting that the ships are either custom made or modified by the Clan in possession of it. Clans may add weapons, armor, modules, and other pieces to the base ship as they conduct raids and grow in martial prowess. </p><br/><h1>ENCOUNTERS</h1><br/><p>Kingships have likely been in service for centuries, though their discovery by the United Empire of Earth(UEE) is relatively recent. The UEE first encountered a Kingship on 18 February 2712, during the Vanduul invasion of the Orion system. The Kingship in question surprised Orion's defenders and immediately turned the tide of the battle in favor of the Vanduul, forcing the UEE Navy to retreat to the Tiber system. The Vanduul did not continue their raid beyond Orion. Instead, the attacking clan kept the ship in question in orbit of the former Human colony for over a year as it gathered resources. </p><br/><p>On 7 July 2884, a Clan led by a Kingship slipped past the Caliban system's sensor beacons and sparked the Fall of Caliban, resulting in both the loss of the system and the 89th UEE Navy Logistic Support Squadron. The Kingship reentered Vanduul space shortly after the end of the battle. </p><br/><p>In 2940, the UEE Navy severely damaged a Kingship as part of Operation Unilateral Force, a covert military operation that intended to weaken a single Vanduul clan and inspire infighting in the hope it would distract them from raiding Human colonies. Though the overall operation failed to have the expected impact, the 78th Squadron succeeded in inflicting heavy damage on the Kingship.</p><br/><p>A Kingship did not appear in Human space again until 5 October 2945, in the Battle of Vega II. The Navy's 2nd Fleet led by Admiral Ernst Bishop engaged the Kingship and remaining clan. After a fierce battle, the UEES <em>Gauntlet</em> charged the weakened Kingship at ramming speed. Both the <em>Gauntlet</em> and the Kingship were destroyed, marking the first time Human forces have successfully downed a Vanduul Kingship. </p><br/><h1>IMPACT</h1><br/><p>The sheer mass, firepower, and mystery surrounding Kingships has made them an object of extreme interest in the UEE. Due to their presence at key Vanduul invasions of Human space they have become symbolic of the extreme nature of the Vanduul threat. Human politicians frequently cite the threat of Kingships as justification for increased military spending.

When they began smuggling goods and people to and from Banu space in the 2690s, they quickly rose to prominence and expanded their network to more systems. In the 2740s, they entered the Pyro system and clashed with the fellow smuggling group the Headhunters. Beginning in 2781, the Drop Kings abruptly stopped this conflict and began to focus on smuggling goods across the borders of the UEE, leading historians to speculate that they were involved in transporting anti-Messer refugees to Banu and Xi'an territories. They returned to business as usual in 2799 and launched an attack on Ruin Station, ousting the Headhunters from power and becoming the de-facto rulers of the Pyro system. Control of Pyro passed back and forth between the Drop Kings and the Headhunters until 2912, when the Drop Kings became involved in a feud with the Terra-based Rangda syndicate.

In the next quarter they'll be looking at the Physical Inventory (the entirety of the system) covering everything from a Medpen all the way up to cargo in a ship, and being able to put things in those boxes. There's no rigid answer right now, but he can say that they've got to holistically tie all of the different designs together. A good example is the strange way that they determine cargo size on the ships, when they should acknowledge that whilst your ship might have a cargo pad which has a certain amount of room, there's nothing stopping the Player from just dropping boxes anywhere in the ship. So really cargo sizes should be regarding what you can secure inside the ship, but then there's also unsecure volume inside the ship for cargo. The main drive for now is on the Player Inventory, so things could be taken off the Player and put into the world and exist as it should, which would also \"give\" lootables.

So you either come into a derelict where you come into one that\u2019s fully powered and fully operational, so for us it\u2019s more about creating situations that will allow players to investigate and try out and deal with the appropriate or find ways to solve those those problems.<br /><br />So whether it\u2019s radiation or oxygen leak or something like that, then you need to go get your suit on, you need to basically have enough oxygen to survive what you need to do in that area or if it\u2019s too close to a sun or something like that then you\u2019re going to be dealing with a certain amount of heat, but those to me are spices that you know, our underlying mission system would be kind of like, let's say the bland food and we use these...<br /><br />CR: You\u2019re gonna get Tony upset about his missions being called bland.<br /><br />TZ: [Laughs]<br /><br />TP: Sorry! That we use these different spices to basically make the missions a lot more interesting and unique for the players run into.<br /><br />TZ: Yeah and in that regard it\u2019s very similar to what we were talking about for the environments to where it gives you this systematic ability to be able to present the player with all this different potential diversity and allow them to figure out their own unique solution as to how they want to chart a course through that.<br /><br />CR: Yeah and the other thing I would say is we\u2019re kinda\u2026 people really haven\u2019t seen it yet, but multicrew ships are going to be a large part of the, in my opinion, the fun gameplay. You and a small group of friends or even a bigger group playing together and you don\u2019t really see that now because right now you can either pilot or perhaps you can man a turret and the turrets still need work, they\u2019ve sort of not had much love because we\u2019re waiting for everything to shift to item system 2.0 so we don\u2019t really want to fix the old turrets, we want it for the new turrets, but they\u2019re just a small part because really for us when you\u2019re flying, it\u2019s you know not just piloting, there\u2019s things like the scanning, the radar, the communications, engineering.<br /><br />So adjusting the systems on the bigger ships, and we\u2019re also going to have the concept of you know, we talked about it, it\u2019s not in but it\u2019s apart of the item 2.0, but the items or the different components of your ship will have age and wear, maintenance, wear level and the idea is that if you\u2019re not really keeping it up and they\u2019re getting old and depending on the quality of the components because we have different quality ratings for them, they can break down. So then you\u2019re gonna have to fix them if they break down, you\u2019re gonna have to replace them and we have smaller items, so like a power plant may have different fuel rods or there may be fuses on power nodes and these things can break down, maybe you\u2019re powering up for quantum drive and  you\u2019re going for long distance and I think we have some plans to make quantum drive not be just automatic and things can short out and you\u2019ve got to run and fix it.<br /><br />Also in combat as you\u2019re in combat, the concept should be that the multicrew ships which is what I was saying they\u2019ll last longer in the future in the PU if you have a crew on it working together, like basically fixing the leaks, replacing the fuse break so constantly almost running around inside repairing it. Like you see in all these science fiction movies, you can extend the life of your multicrew ship in combat which will be important because generally the multicrew ships won\u2019t move as fast as the single seat fighters and everything, but they\u2019re much more tanky because not only are they bigger and not only will they have more armour, power and shields, but they\u2019ll have an active crew be able to run around and fix things as they\u2019re breaking, whereas if you\u2019re on a single seater ship, you can\u2019t really stop in the middle of dogfight, get out, EVA and repair the shield generator that blew a fuse or whatever so there will definitely be stuff to be done in combat, but even on long distance travels.<br /><br />If you think about going from one system to another system, maybe during the course of it you\u2019ll have to do some maintenance for your engine or repair fuses and I think that sort of gameplay that could, because we are going to have some transit times on the longer distances where you\u2019re not going to be quantum for a few seconds, you\u2019re going to be in quantum drive for you know, minutes or 10\u2019s of minutes in the longest cases so there will be some aspect of maintaining your ship and keeping it going and making sure you\u2019ve stocked up on items. I think there\u2019s a lot of real potential for gameplay that comes out of this whole idea of these systemic components or items that all interact together that need to be taken care of, that need to be maintained to run right and the people that know how to do it and balance it and juggle it will be the more successful ones out there.<br /><br />TP: And also with that system I mean, when I was talking about environments, it\u2019s used in the same system that he\u2019s talking about right now. So now it would be filtered even down to basically the planets or the planetary outposts that we\u2019ve shown as well as satellites and everything in our universe will be using power plants or solar arrays or some sort of power generator, but it is basically using the same power system.<br /><br />CR: Yes It\u2019s the same system underneath it all for all for it and so we\u2019re hoping that, it\u2019s probably a bit more than you would normally see in a game, but it\u2019s one system that goes across everything whether it\u2019s down on the ground or on the ships, satellites you were mentioning and once you learn the interaction and the use of it, it hopefully should be fairly intuitive and be a simplified version of what you get in the real world and then from that there\u2019s a lot of possibility because you can not only have to maintain stuff, but you could actually actively disrupt stuff to prevent someone, like say you\u2019re boarding this ship, you as a someone who\u2019s trying to take over a ship, take over a space station, or take over an environment on the ground can also use these things intelligently like cut someone's power off to you know, seal them in that area.<br /><br />TP: You want to have those counter plays.<br /><br />CR: Yeah.<br /><br />TP: That people can have.<br /><br />TZ: Well I would add to what you\u2019ve said that people haven\u2019t seen the true potential of multi-crew and what it's actually going to mean in so far as the gameplay, and one of the areas which is going to a take I think dramatic leap forward is going to be when we actually start to incorporate the crew. Right now you tend to basically take over a ship of any size and there\u2019s one player or maybe he\u2019s got another person or two, but it\u2019s just, you kill one or two or three guys and now you own the ship and it\u2019s going to be dramatically different when players have the ability to go out and for example: since they want to guard against exactly that, they spend a little bit more money, they hire NPC, could be player characters with a particularly high combat rating and then basically anyone that wants to board that ship and take it over is first going to have to get through all those crew members before they can actually even have a chance at basically seizing control and taking the ship and then even after they do that they're gonna face all the impediments that we were talking about as far as the law is basically going to be on them if they\u2019re in a secure zone and a variety of other things and so all of a sudden you can start to see the act of trying to take some of these larger ships, it\u2019s not going to be something that plays out in a minute or two, it\u2019s going to be these long drawn out battles to where you basically got probably one well organised force of players potentially with NPC backup fighting against another entrenched group of players whose ship has probably been disabled, but now they\u2019re able to fight to repel these boarders and what you\u2019re going to get is a chunk, you\u2019re going to get a gameplay experience that's going to be unlike any we\u2019ve been able to put forward thus far.", "published_at": "2017-01-17", "title": "Star Citizen: Subscribers Town Hall - Persistent Universe", "source": "https://youtu.be/o5zqdq9Ay_Q", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "time": "21m0s", "published_at_timestamp": 1484691636}, {"objectID": "1854f806b53d8b_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The UEE's dropship needs are met by the various options provided by standard military contracts with Anvil, Aegis and other suppliers of related equipment.

We definitely felt that being a citizen would give you some rights, and one of the rights would be able to, vote or have some effect on general things in the same way, I guess you do in the real world. Which is pretty not that much!So that is a longer term goal to have some participation in that. Probably will be Game Mastered by us, because we're planning to besides just having the simulation of the universe we also hand push it and guide it towards, 'cause we have an overall story and timeline we have in our minds for Star CItizen. So we'll create events and elections and seismic change events in the universe that will potentially affect players and AI.One of those could be elections. I don't think we'll in the short term anyway, have a player run for the office in the United Empire of Earth but again long term you never know. We're pretty big on player agency and participation. A lot of the fun that I see happening in the SC Alpha 2.1 and 2.2 is players doing stuff and creating content for other players and we're pretty big on that. That's our whole sort of mission. Our world system is built up to react to what players and AI is doing and based on that it generates other missions, so it's sort of a feedback loop. So getting players involved in other things is good.So longer term potentially, you never know I think they have a version of players involved in EvE in terms of running things as well. So I think as we said something we're planning long term but we are going to give you benefits for being a citizen to allow you to participate or get certain things that you wouldn't if you weren't a citizen. And of potentially would be voting for this person or that person and then depending on which one you voted for, as an AI character it could have an impact on how the world unfolds in Star Citizen.So that's kind of the fun element we're thinking that we really again player's themselves doing things, changing, affecting the world and the game or us as Game Masters reacting to that, keeping it fluid and dynamic should be fun!", "published_at": "2016-03-14", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 79", "source": "https://youtu.be/7sCTnlihzEY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Apportioner", "published_at_timestamp": 1457991105}, {"objectID": "373680150", "question": "Will there be a storyline in Star Marine to be a little like Squadron 42 with some rendered cutscenes?

The thing I want to talk about here though is; Star Marine is a simulation within the first person universe. Much like Arena Commander is a simulation within the first person universe. It's a game within a game. Star Marine is going to be a test bed for new features, new game types, new mission objectives and maps. We even plan on rolling out a way to do white box testing in the environments that you expect to use in the PU or even a part of a level for Squadron 42. Perhaps maybe we'll even roll out new enemy AI behaviour for certain monsters or other NPCs out there so we can test within that environment and get that working right and tweaked, get feedback from backers and get that into the game itself proper.The other questions will there be a story? Yes. Some modes will have a story and again it's like the setting, rather than the story. So it's like pirates are attacking the station. Fight them off. That's a story but it's not a big story. So it's not a story like you see in Squadron 42 that's where the big story arcs are going to come from.Jake Ross: And Star Marine is also used like Arena Commander is used like a simulation to practice your dog fighting skills. This is a simulation to practice your first person shooter skills if you don't want to jump right into the game.JH: Yeah. Not only that not only first person shooter skills.

I actually just had this discussion with a few other producers, one of the things we have to look at is whatever given development time we have with internal deadlines, say we have a patch due out in a week, is it feasible or even wise to get all of these bugs fixed and sacrifice feature development. Do we want to take a developer off a feature to fix a bug? It depends in part on how big a problem it is, if it's a blocker, or prevents a player being able to play at all, then that'll take priority, but if its something that will ultimately be fixed in normal development, we'll not usually assign any time to it, because there's a good chance that down the line a re-design or change made in feature development might actually fix it without costing more developers time.Travis Day: That's a great example I was talking about with Paul with regards to the Gladiator release recently. There are certain behaviours within the ship that are exposed in the production of multicrew that are supposed to be handled by the GOST system, like the position of turret seats when a player gets in or out etc, the same thing applies to the constellation etc. All of these issues are handled by GOST, but we get into a situation sometimes where things are broken with multiple people trying to access different parts of the ship, a seat might not reset or whatever. We have to fix that, BUT there are other funny issues where if you use something before another animation is finished that should be mutually exclusive, like maybe deploying a stairwell while closing a door that it goes through, that'll all get fixed by GOST in the long run, and doesn't affect the actual game experience.DV: Actually in the context of the Constellation, because we're in the middle of a redesign of the ship, it doesn't make sense to do anything about those bugs, because they might not be present in the new version of the ships. As producers this is what we manage, we might close those bugs or shuffle them off to later versions to check if they exist then.", "published_at": "2015-04-20", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 05 (2015.04.20)", "source": "https://youtu.be/YJeaYs_U-Mg", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Algared", "published_at_timestamp": 1429567111}, {"objectID": "373676560", "question": "Will the larger ships such as the Starfarer or Orion have weapon racks so we can change our weapon loadout on the fly?

So, if that's what you mean in terms of having access to weapons on the rack, then yes people on the ship would have access to the weapons on the rack assuming they were cleared to unlock the rack/get a weapon off it.

The ships were brought into engine and they were nice, but there's a whole bunch of cleanup in terms of the hierarchy, there needs to be a certain amount of physics proxies, both inside and outside, it needs to be broken up in a certain way so parts can animate and open and all work inside the vehicle system that we use.So there's a bunch of work. We're actually going to be working with the finalists, paying them actually, to do some of the finishing work, and then we'll take it in house to finish it off here.When that's done, we're hoping to bring it out with the Mustang, which was the other ship that we premiered on The Next Great Starship, and let you guys add it to your collection if you like.As far as the prices go, we haven't set it, but it probably should equate to something that is equivalent to its weaponry, so we're obviously not going to be selling a gunship with big turrets and everything for the price of an Aurora. We haven't finalized it, it will be commensurate with the costs of the other ships, but it's a cool ship.And also at that time I think we're going to see if you guys are interested in having some of the other ships in the game, because they're all pretty awesome obviously. The top four at least were pretty brilliant, so I could be quite happy seeing them in the game.So then, Next Great Starship season 2. Well I think we definitely...

We've actually had a debate about that because we're in the process of fleshing out the cargo system.That would be what the standardized sizes of the cargo are, how you load and unload your ship, how you're able to dump it in space if a pirate says \"give me your cargo or else I'll kill you,\" how are you able to bring cargo in from space back into your hold.We've been working on all those aspects, some pretty cool design stuff. So one of the things we were talking about was, you could have a fancier basic cargo container.Think of our basic cargo containers as containers in the real world right now. If you see what gets put on trains or container ships or trucks driving around, normally for example someone makes a bunch of TVs in Korea, they pack 'em up and put them in a big container. Then the container gets taken by a truck to the train station. The train station takes it to the boat and puts it on. The boat comes across to America and then they unload it and it gets put back onto a train and then it goes to a distribution center, then on a truck and it's in Best Buy, an electronics store, or Amazon delivers it to you.So we have the same concept of containers, just because it's simpler to have uniform sizes. There can be bigger ones and smaller ones, but they all have volumes that are defined that our holds are built for. And the fancier ones, if you want to invest in a more expensive container, we were considering having tracking, like Lo-Jack on it or something. But most of them won't have that. Most of them, if the cargo's floating out in space and you come across it and take it in, then at that point it's finder's keeper's unless it's marked.Obviously if you were the person that forced the cargo to be in space by illegal pirate attack and you're in a well regulated or policed areas and someone saw you do this or the ship you attacked got a distress call out, then you probably will be wanted for the piracy act.So there you are, I guess if you happen to find some cargo floating there because of some other battle, and you pick it up, you'll be ok so long as it's not tagged with the more fancy container stuff.", "published_at": "2014-03-24", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 13 (2014.03.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/IIkeFs5xubw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Garrosian", "published_at_timestamp": 1395698672}, {"objectID": "373685470", "question": "What if someone failed to board my ship?
