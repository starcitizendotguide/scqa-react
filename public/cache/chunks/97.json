A governmental body called the Protectorate or the Protectorate Council, made up of hundreds of individual Banu, maintains connections between Banu systems and manages high-level administrative tasks. Essosouli from across Banu space can be called to convene in the Bacchus system and join the Protectorate in debating issues that affect the Banu as a whole in an event known as the Gathering(eTsey\u00e6 Y\u00e6). The BP maintains friendly trade relations with most known spacefaring civilizations. </p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>Because Banu do not keep historical records, it is unclear when in their history they formed the Protectorate. The earliest known iteration of the BP was encountered in MXY III.364 (SEY 1924) in the Trise system, upon Banu-Xi'an First Contact. At that time, the Banu had already settled in multiple planetary systems, and were utilizing the Protectorate Council and the Gathering as a method of large-scale management. The BP has continued to operate in the same manner since that time. Given the current consensus among xeno-anthropologists that the Banu people are originally from the ocean world Bacchus II, it is speculated that the earliest form of the BP emerged based on alliances between the small island-nations that make up the majority of land on the planet. </p><br/><h1>GOVERNMENT</h1><br/><p>Each planet-state and city-state within the BP is governed by one or more political and bureaucratic Soulis that plan the tasks needed to keep their locales operating smoothly, and then execute them by forming contracts with Soulis that perform said tasks. These include energy production and distribution, water service, sewage processing, road maintenance, garbage collection, and many others. Compensated for their work via a complex system involving bartering combined with monetary payment, these Soulis hold a great deal of power, and are known to withdraw their services if they encounter unfavorable conditions. Conversely, if they gain a reputation for operating in bad faith, they may face retaliation from other Soulis. Although there are some truly independent groups of Banu that operate in their own unique manners, this method of governance is the most common one used in the BP.</p><br/><p>Similar to the Soulis that operate planet-states, the Protectorate Council takes care of the tasks necessary to keep Banu society functional from the top down. These include the distribution of shared currency, the management of inter-civilization trade, the negotiation of treaties, and other ministerial activity. Banu who want a seat on the Protectorate must purchase it directly from their predecessors. In some cases they are handpicked for purchase of the seat, usually from among the non-Protectorate affiliated Essosouli who attend the Gathering. The most successful members of the Protectorate are those who know how to balance the pursuit of their own agenda with the necessity of working with others to achieve a common goal. </p><br/><p>The Gathering is the most important political event in the BP. Generally held on an as-needed basis, it tends to occur two or three times per Standard Earth Year, although sometimes multiple years can pass between meetings. Issues that will affect the entirety of the BP are presented and debated at Gatherings, such as the valuation of their shared currency, the renegotiation of trade agreements, the reassessment of laws and customs, the state of the BP's borders, and others.

It was founded in SEY 2458 as a result of a merger between former news channels Sheridan Special News Television (SSNtv) and Communications Alliance (CA). It was the first news network to broadcast to all United Empire of Earth (UEE) planetary systems. While it currently has hundreds of affiliates and satellite offices, it primarily broadcasts out of Terra (Terra III).</p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>SSNtv was the first network originating from Earth (Sol III) to broadcast to Mars (Sol IV) and was the dominant news network among Humans until the discovery of the Croshaw system in 2271. As Human territory expanded to other planetary systems, SSNtv's reach narrowed due to limitations in communication technology. Content delivery delays of several days to several weeks were common between systems. Rival network CA was established on Reisse (Rhetor III) in 2398 to combat this gap. Thanks to the Rhetor system's cutting-edge communications network, CA\u2019s reach expanded more quickly than SSNtv's, and the network began to struggle. In 2458, SSNtv accepted a merger proposal from CA and SSN/CAtv was born.</p><br/><p>SSN/CAtv initially transmitted a continuous stream of news, hosted by a rotating cast of anchors. It gradually increased its focus on politics, purchasing Showdown! in 2522 as its keystone debate program. This shift in content brought high profits with it, enabling the network to open a new headquarters on Cestulus (Davien II) in 2525. In 2529, SSN/CAtv provided on-the-ground coverage of the Unified Currency Riot in Jata, Cestulus, including its quelling by the United Planets of Earth (UPE)  military. After first contact with the Xi'an in 2530 and discovery of the Tevarin in 2541, the network\u2019s content began to gradually lean pro-war and anti-alien. </p><br/><p>Upon the ascension of Ivar Messer I to the office of Prime Citizen in 2546, SSN/CAtv\u2019s content took a hard pro-government shift. The host and crew of <em>Showdown!</em> were fired and replaced after they aired a special episode urging people to act against Messer's consolidation of power. Deacon Messer II became one of the network's prime shareholders in 2601. After this point, SSN/CAtv became one of the cornerstones of the United Empire of Earth's (UEE) propaganda machine. </p><br/><p>In 2630, SSN/CAtv relocated to an expansive headquarters on Terra. The network slowly began to allow some UEE-critical content to air, while still maintaining a pro-Messer stance in the majority of its programming. For example, SSN/CAtv played a pivotal role in discrediting Terran Senator Assan Kieren's reputation during his call for Terran sovereignty in 2638, but it also allowed its pundit and debate programs to feature anti-military and pro-secession guests. </p><br/><p>During the power struggle between Astrid Messer VII and Samuel Messer VIII, reporters on multiple shows stepped too far out of line, harshly criticizing the Messers for their infighting. In 2699, Astrid Messer VII retaliated by conducting mass arrests and censoring over half the network\u2019s programming into cancellation. Samuel Messer VIII rescinded the mass censorship upon taking office in 2701, but ordered that all content aired henceforth on the network had to be approved by the Imperator's office. Those imprisoned by Astrid Messer VII were not pardoned, and were forced to serve out the remainder of their sentences. </p><br/><h1>ROLE IN THE DEPOSITION OF THE MESSER REGIME</h1><br/><p>Anonymous SSN/CAtv insiders began organizing with anti-Messer activists as early as 2702. They aided the resistance in two key ways: they allowed the rebels to pass along encrypted messages via the network's communications arrays, and fed them information uncensored by the Messer government. Once such piece of information was footage from the Massacre of Garron II. On 11 April 2792, technicians responsible for the network feed allowed footage of the Massacre, along with a message from the resistance group Tide, to interrupt a broadcast of SSN/CAtv Nightly News. This broadcast was the inciting incident of the revolution that would eventually depose the Messer regime.</p><br/><h1>TODAY</h1><br/><p>SSN/CAtv hosts a wide variety of news and news-related content. Some of their flagship programs include pure news shows Empire Report and SSN/CAtv Nightly News, the pundit-centered debate program <em>Showdown!</em> and the UEE-critical talk show Plain Truth.

It's not like you're going to do this raid and they you get this raid armour. It's a completely different type of game. We kind of, the way we're going to build armour sets and our items and our clothing. which kind of ties up to another question isl there's going to be different item slots, for specific armour and so for instance like the heavy armour will have a lot more slots, item slots compared to the medium or the light.So it all depends on kind of what you decide to wear, but the thing is, the heavier armour you wear, the slower you might be, the less visibility you'll have. So there's always a pro and con. So there isn't necessarily the best armour suit but there is the best armour suit for certain situations that would be I think, a better term, explanation of what the armour, power armour type of things.Also in terms of visuals and functions. So we currently as Chris mentioned I think two Ten For The Chairman's ago, or three, I don't know when this airs! He was talking about just the marines and having an undersuit and having items attached, I just finished, i've been working on the maries for a month or two and so without spoilering anything, we have a suit like an under suit and we have items attached to it. So pieces will literally be attached to the undersuit. So in terms of visuals I concepted it so it looks like things can come off and on quite quickly, it's almost like you're literally just attaching things. It's not like Lego.Will Weissbaum: No it's like The Centurions!JL: Right! Cause we were talking earlier...pretty much.WW: Bonus points if you got that reference.JL: So that's how I designed it, I also had to take into consideration of what type of item attachments they'll have, cause that determines the forms of the shapes and also the rigging. How the character will more I can't just put two hundred pound like shoulder pads like World of Warcraft or like the Space Marines or like. I can't do that because it restricts our movement, so I had to take those into con... So a lot of those basic anatomy things like movement can determine how I shape these things so.WW: So do you get like a breakdown from design on what a piece of armour needs to be in order to hook into item wise or carry or?JL: Well for this character what they kind of did was they gave me the basic requirements of \"This is what this suit is supposed to do\" or \"This is what the light or the medium or the heavy will have to have\" And I had to fill in a lot of those.Design they give us as much information as they possibly can but sometimes they can't give you the right answers because they don't build it and I build it myself, I look under and over and around and be like \"Oh we're missing this\".Also in terms of visuals a lot of reference. There's a lot of current day military and also a lot of cool shapes like movies like Blade Runner, Aliens some of that stuff.

How are they intended to work?", "answer": "So the escape pods will not be functional in 2.0. Longer term they will but probably not for 2.1 but I would say after that. The idea will be you should be able to... especially for the PU you should be able to get into the escape pod, seal it up and get out of there which is sort of your escape when the ship's going down. So the bigger multi crew ships when they're about to blow I think we've sort of previewed some kind of warning and damage states that you got only so many seconds to get out before the thing blows and that will be either getting into your EVA suit and trying to EVA far enough away so the explosion won't hurt you or getting into an escape pod and escaping away which will eject you and probably keep you more safe.Generally if your ship is about to ready blow in the PU especially you would get into your escape pod and the escape pod has a tracker or tag on it, so that's how you would get found and respawn and go back to sort of the last friendly planet you were on. That's how they're intended to work so if you obviously do use the escape pod that's one of the ways to save your lives so to speak otherwise when your ship blows up, then you'll have lost one of your lives and you'll wake up in the hospital after they found your almost dead body and charred and brought you back to life, so yes use escape pods when we have them working that is.", "published_at": "2015-11-16", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 70", "source": "https://youtu.be/ezrghcBRcSk", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Resk", "published_at_timestamp": 1447716094}, {"objectID": "373681070", "question": "With the plan for AC 2.0 to be a 'baby PU' are we still going to be able to bring the larger multicrew ships into the AC we have now?", "answer": "Yes, what we're basically calling Multicrew, or what we've decided, we made the switch to SC Alpha 1.0 a little while ago, but really, with multicrew, that's... that's pretty much you're going to be getting what we would consider sort of SC Alpha, because you're going to have the full sort of space experience on a huge massive scale. You're gonna have all the sort of combat FPS elements there, you're gonna have social elements, so all the things you see up until then will all be there in one package. So, then you can probably look at it and say, yeah, you could call this an early Star Citizen alpha. It still won't' have landing on planets and taking off from planets and going to different star systems, but a lot of the game mechanics will be there, it'll be sort of the test bed that will be adding into. Now, the question is, would we be able to bring large mulcicrew ships into Arena Commander, which is sort of the game within the game, AC is the sort of practice mode for you to play to make sure that you have a chance to get good at combat before you actually put things on the line with your real ship out there in space. And I would say that, that is the long-term plan. In the short term, the very first release of SC Alpha, what we're calling 1.3, which is going to be the multicrew release, it'll have FPS and social and all those things in it, we won't have the ability to bring you multicrew ships into AC as it stands. You can still do AC, still be ranked, still have the matches, but it will be the set of ships that you have right now. In a subsequent release, the next one, or the one after, we will, cause mainly the issue is there's a whole new lobby UI that you'd need for multicrew ships in an Arena Commander sort of arena battle mode where, here's my constellation, and here's who's going to be in my upper turret, here's my lower, here's my copilot, which we don't have that lobby UI, and we sort of decided because we're building the multicrew release to be sort of this 'baby PU' or 'SC Alpha', you will spawn on a space station and you and a bunch of other people will spawn on a space station like, you spawn on ArcCorp right now on the social module, and you can call up which ship you want on a landing pad that you have from your account, you go to it, and your friends can join you in that ship and then you can take off and explore around and fight other AI that are on the large map or come across other players, or sort of do what you want in a free-form fashion. So, that's sort of the initial way of using the multicrew ships. There's a lot more territory to explore, different locations to find and explore, so I think people are gonna have a lot of fun. We'll be building out and fleshing out gameplay and functionality and features in this sort of map that I think I've referred to in the past as sort of a test kitchen of all the sort of in depth gameplay, and I think when people get SC Alpha 1.3 / multicrew, and play it, that will be the experience to go, okay, I see how all of this stuff fits together in Star Citizen, and I am psyched, because I am pretty psyched. So, that's sort of the goal and then later on, like I said, we will make Arena Commander also work with multicrew ships, and maybe there's classification of you know, the best Connstelation pilot, or the best constellation combat person, because we still have plans for Arena Commander, and also for Star Marine to have more in-depth matchmaking, sort of ranking systems, so that we'll be much more akin to what you would see on you know, Blizzard do very well with their Battle.net stuff. So we'll definitely have that, but we thought the first thing we want to do is get you into this big large world map with your friends and adventure around. So, you won't be able to really do AC as sort of the game within the game with a constellation in the very first release of multicrew, but it will be in a subsequent release. THe one after, or the one after that, and it sort of depends when we can fit the time for the UI for it in, because everyone's pretty much tasked fully on everything they're doing right now.

How are these changes achieved in an engine that physically models ship movement? Do these changes affect manoeuvrability across other ships?", "answer": "Darian Vorlick: This kinda ties in with what TD just mention where centre of mass is concerned, and how there are other factors involved with how ships manoeuvre.Travis Day: Yeah, so there are different ways that a ship's manoeuvrability can be changed, so there's power available, power draw of various thrusters, the power plant itself, the thrusters themselves are unique, so changing them on one ship won't change another. So there's the Power Plant, the cooling, the thrusters, their power output, how quickly they can articulate (if they can at all). These will all affect the final \"feel\" of the ship, so those are kinda the primary things that we mess around with. Sometimes, like the mustang, it's multiple things, here its the power output, the range of articulation, the speed of articulation etc. So the Mustang was a pretty extensive modification.DV: These are all things that the tuning kit can also change or affect, we haven't really established exactly what extent the tuning kit will do things to, or even exactly what it does, but as a stretch goal we want to make it as useful as possible.TD: Some of the things you'd adjust will be derivative of the items themselves, like there might be 4 different types of thrusters you can equip, each have their advantages, one might be super quick, one might have a really wide articulation range, another might be really powerful but fixed, or more fuel efficient one. Within that will establish the basic nature of an item, then you can modify within a range each has.DV: A good example would be to take your favourite compact car and put a ford mustang or a corvette engine in it. That'll change the performance characteristics of that car, because 1) It wasn't designed for that engine in the first place, so you'd need to upgrade the suspension, the transmission etc. So if you're the kinda person that spends a weekend under your car, the same sort of things apply here.TD: And you might want to take some things BACK, for example, if you upgrade your manoeuvring thrusters and your engine, but not your cooling system or powerplant, your might want to tune your new equipment BACK to 60%, or you might be constantly overheating, or not be able to fire any time you thrust up wards.", "published_at": "2015-03-16", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 04 (2015.03.16)", "source": "https://youtu.be/lstuaA4WsVA", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "SP3CTREnyc", "published_at_timestamp": 1426543213}, {"objectID": "373676670", "question": "In regards to the PU \"Instances\", if I were stalking someone over multiple solar systems, how are we ensured that we will be instanced with that person every time.", "answer": "In that particular case, that the whole point of the \"Person of Interest\" system.

We haven't prototyped that out fully, but the concept of that is you're going to be flying down the equivalent of a huge breaking wave down off the North Shore of Hawaii. If you have to go down the funnel, essentially surf it exactly correctly down the path, as long as you keep on the path and get to the end of it, and depending on the size of it the and the length of it we'll have turbulence and all that. Once you get to the end and you've tracked that, and recorded that in your navigational computer, then you can automatically go back and do it again.

Like \"Hmm, I wonder if I should ask if he's got any work for me\" or \"Nah, I'll just chitchat,\" those would be two sort of inner thoughts that your character would have and then you pick between them and that would determine the direction you would take it.I would guess that's a little in the line of what we did in the Wing Commander stuff with, obviously especially with Wing Commander 3 and 4, but the big thing is that we're doing a lot more about the action and the body language.So where you're looking, what you're doing, what your actions are is also being taken into account in terms of how you're communicating with the NPCs when you're planet side, for a more realistic, or a hopefully more realistic feeling. I mean generally when you engage people, you'll look them in the eye, and if you look away from them and stop paying attention to them, they'll get offended.We're sort of trying to build and model all that stuff in our conversation system. I think it's gonna be pretty cool. I would say that's kind of what we're doing, I mean I don't know this question could potentially be saying \"do you want to have voice recognition or no voice recognition,\" or just menus. I would say our input mechanism is going to be either a combination of menus, or actions that you do.Like if I go up and I look at someone in the eyes, that means I want to talk to you, or if someone's looking me in the eyes and I ignore them and carry on walking on, that means I'm not going to pay attention to you.We're gonna drive a lot of the NPC interaction via your actual actions, which I think's pretty good.

I think we would probably break it out in such a way that you would see, if you encounter someone again, you would see their average rating and then also, if you had ever worked with them before, the rating that you gave them. So I guess the answer there would be yes on that.", "published_at": "2014-04-14", "title": "10 for the Chairman - Episode 16 .

I want to base the Hornets full time in my Idris. All ships are on the same account, will there be a way to part and leave fighters in the fighter bay of the Idris?", "answer": "So the answer is yes. I mean the Idris is designed to have a complement of small ships on it. I think in Squadron 42 we sort of decided that it has an active complement of two ships. So in the military it's two Hornets, then it has a back-up spare Hornet in case one gets destroyed. And that's sort of the standard core complement on a military patrol set up. So if you have say, two Hornets, you definitely will be able to have them in your Idris. Think of it like big ships have their inventories, and smaller ships have inventories, rooms have inventories. So you essentially move your Hornet from the inventory in your hangar to the inventory in your Idris which is basically the hangar there. Yes, you'll be able to do that. So you'll be well armed, and you should have able to hire either NPCs to fly it or more preferably with something like an Idris, which is really not designed to be a solo vehicle, you and your friends can have fun. As I mentioned a little earlier in the show, talking about the Hornet tracker and command and control ships, we're really doing some stuff on the bigger ships, the capital ships, that I\"m super excited by that's really going to push it. It's going to be like almost a whole game in itself running these big ships. I think you guys are really gonna like that.", "published_at": "2014-02-10", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 07 (2014.02.10)", "source": "https://youtu.be/-y0GQV_Bx4U", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Viperalpha", "published_at_timestamp": 1392073473}, {"objectID": "373686020", "question": "How will contracts work between organizations and individuals? Will there be a system in place within the game, or organization module, that will allow organizations or individuals to negotiate contracts, insure cargo or assets involved, and finalize payout?", "answer": "So we'll definitely have a system to be able to handle this kind of thing. We may even have a system where you can put money in escrow until a job is performed. Maybe someone administers that for a fee. Also we're going to have a rating system. I think we've mentioned this before, but in America there is this service called Uber where you can hire cars to take you places, and both the person that hires the car and the driver of the car rate the other person. So when you are looking at a car nearby, you can see what that driver's rating is and the driver can also see what your rating is. So you obviously don't want to go with someone that only has a one star rating, you want to go with someone who has a four or a five star rating, and I think that in that case we would definitely have both parties in some contract. When you hire someone like an employer hires someone to run a mission, both the employer and the person running the mission can rate each other so you can sort of see, ok, this is a transport pilot and he's got a 4.5 star rating out of 5, he's pretty good, he's definitely worth paying a premium when this guy's got a 3 star rating over here. So we'll have a bit of that sort of self-regulating objective ratings, and also maybe some systems like escrow and a role that someone can take as an arbitrator for a fee, to arbitrate disputes, I think we'll have system that are fairly similar to what's in the real world to make that kind of stuff work well.", "published_at": "2014-01-17", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 05 (2014.01.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/RtyZzO5OrE0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "TotkenKopf", "published_at_timestamp": 1389982600}, {"objectID": "1da456ca9cbe24_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Is a fully loaded cargo bay going to affect our ability to speed up and slow down vice our maneuvering capabilities when our ship is unloaded?", "answer": "Yes (see above) [Real inertia is used for all the calculations - the ship's computer is calculating the needed thrust based on the ship's current moment of inertia - which is re-calculated anytime the ship has a part added or taken away. So yes longer skinnier ships should roll quicker (assuming the same powered maneuvering thrusters)]", "user": "AFKeefer", "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12grru/i_am_chris_roberts_creator_of_wing_commander/c6uwzxk/", "published_at_timestamp": 1351771200, "title": "r/IAmA: Chris Roberts", "type": "reddit"}]
