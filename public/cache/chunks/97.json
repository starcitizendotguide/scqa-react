Considered a delicacy for its tender, sweet meat, it is also a popular aquarium pet, and is one of the more commonly seen animals on shipboard aquatic enclosures.</p><br/><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1><br/><p>Thorshu have long, bright orange-red colored carapaces that cover their soft inner bodies, curved upwards into a narrow crescent. They have two dactyls and six walking legs, tipped in sky blue with mottled cream accents. The dark, barnacle-like lumps that grow on their carapaces and front claws may be eyespots, evolved to trick potential predators away from the thorshu\u2019s most vulnerable spots. Thorshu that have more eyespots than others have more success in mating. On average, they grow to between 10 and 20 cm long, and live for around 20 years.</p><br/><h1>BEHAVIOR AND ECOLOGY</h1><br/><p>Though they are largely solitary, thorshu demonstrate complex social behavior in the wild. Upon meeting one another for the first time they engage in ritualized fighting, and ignore one another upon subsequent meetings. They are highly intelligent, able to recognize individual thorshu by scent and color, even if they have not re-encountered each other for several years. Captive thorshu have been known to escape their containers if not provided with stimulating enough environments.</p><br/><p>In their lifetime, they can breed as many as 30 times. Eggs are laid in burrows dug under seabed rocks. The offspring spend the first few months of their life as microscopic organisms. They molt into their adult form at roughly four months, molting again multiple times until reaching their final size in their third year.</p><br/><h1>COMMERCIAL FOOD</h1><br/><p>On Terra (Terra III), thorshu are commercially bred and raised for their meat. Thousands of tons of whole flash-frozen thorshu are shipped across the UEE every year and sold to high-end restaurants. The leg meat is especially prized for its complex flavor, and is often served hot and dipped in a drawn butter and oza sauce. On Terra, where the thorshu is a conventional catch for local fishers, breaded and fried thorshu claws are a relatively common street food, especially in Quasi.</p><br/><h1>POPULAR CULTURE</h1><br/><p>Thanks to its color, size, and tendency to stay in the open, the thorshu is a favorite denizen of cold saltwater aquariums. It became a fashionable pet in the 27th century after being used as the model for the sidekick character Waka Grey in the children\u2019s show Clawsome. However, its tendency to break out of insecure enclosures and attack brightly colored objects such as decorative glassware put an end to the trend shortly after the show\u2019s final season.

Like other detritivorous animals, it feeds on the waste and dead material that collects at the bottom of bodies of water. The tentacles on its head aid the vindel in digging through the substrate to find food. Because of its small size and the voracity of its appetite, the vindel is favored by aquarium enthusiasts to control algae blooms and consume the waste of other fish. </p><br/><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1><br/><p>A vindel can be identified by its distinctive mottled green scaleless skin and the six tentacles that sprout from the front of its flattened head. Instead of eyes, vindels have two false eye spots on their backs, which are used to deceive potential predators. The false eyes double as electroreceptors that alert the vindel if a potential predator gets too close. They have four triangular, blue-green pectoral fins, a long, thin dorsal fin, and blue-green tail fins. Over a 20 year life cycle, the vindel grows no more than 25 cm long. </p><br/><h1>BEHAVIOR AND ECOLOGY</h1><br/><p>On Locke, vindels exist in every climate except the arctic. They are highly adaptive, capable of breathing in very murky water, and have even been found in brackish water near the mouths of rivers. Water that has been purchased on or harvested from Locke must be thoroughly inspected for vindels before it is taken off world. Vindels that have made it into the water supply of spacecraft have been known to survive there for up to two standard weeks before starving. </p><br/><p>In the wild, vindels spawn in the spring and summer, or when the water that they inhabit reaches a temperature of between 21 and 29 degrees Celsius. When they are ready to spawn, the male locates a nesting area such as between rocks, in the roots of plants, undercuts of banks, or other areas in which the eggs can be protected from strong currents. After the female lays her eggs, the male fertilizes them and drives the female from the nest. He then guards the eggs, chasing off predators and fanning them with his fins to keep them free of excessive sediment. The eggs hatch after roughly 12 standard Earth days. After all the eggs have hatched, the male leaves, and the fry disperse. Vindels can spawn every three standard weeks.</p><br/><p>The fry that are not eaten by predators or otherwise killed reach maturity in about one Standard Earth Year. They generally do not breed until they have reached at least 15 cm in length.</p><br/><h1>INVASIVE SPECIES</h1><br/><p>Thanks to its hearty constitution and appetite for algae, the vindel has become a popular aquarium fish since its discovery in 2494 by United Nations of Earth (UNE) surveyors. A vindel needs little supplementary feeding unless it is the only fish in its tank, and can survive in a wide range of temperatures. However, these attributes have also made it an invasive species in many parts of the UEE. It was so successful in taking root on Reisse (Rhetor III) that it caused the extinction of 11 other indigenous detritivores before the Governors Council was able to enact measures to get it under control.

You should generally expect good communication between the fighter pilot and the Polaris crew for a smooth procedure, or the safer option would be to either slow down or stop the Polaris.

It's not like you're going to do this raid and they you get this raid armour. It's a completely different type of game. We kind of, the way we're going to build armour sets and our items and our clothing. which kind of ties up to another question isl there's going to be different item slots, for specific armour and so for instance like the heavy armour will have a lot more slots, item slots compared to the medium or the light.So it all depends on kind of what you decide to wear, but the thing is, the heavier armour you wear, the slower you might be, the less visibility you'll have. So there's always a pro and con. So there isn't necessarily the best armour suit but there is the best armour suit for certain situations that would be I think, a better term, explanation of what the armour, power armour type of things.Also in terms of visuals and functions. So we currently as Chris mentioned I think two Ten For The Chairman's ago, or three, I don't know when this airs! He was talking about just the marines and having an undersuit and having items attached, I just finished, i've been working on the maries for a month or two and so without spoilering anything, we have a suit like an under suit and we have items attached to it. So pieces will literally be attached to the undersuit. So in terms of visuals I concepted it so it looks like things can come off and on quite quickly, it's almost like you're literally just attaching things. It's not like Lego.Will Weissbaum: No it's like The Centurions!JL: Right! Cause we were talking earlier...pretty much.WW: Bonus points if you got that reference.JL: So that's how I designed it, I also had to take into consideration of what type of item attachments they'll have, cause that determines the forms of the shapes and also the rigging. How the character will more I can't just put two hundred pound like shoulder pads like World of Warcraft or like the Space Marines or like. I can't do that because it restricts our movement, so I had to take those into con... So a lot of those basic anatomy things like movement can determine how I shape these things so.WW: So do you get like a breakdown from design on what a piece of armour needs to be in order to hook into item wise or carry or?JL: Well for this character what they kind of did was they gave me the basic requirements of \"This is what this suit is supposed to do\" or \"This is what the light or the medium or the heavy will have to have\" And I had to fill in a lot of those.Design they give us as much information as they possibly can but sometimes they can't give you the right answers because they don't build it and I build it myself, I look under and over and around and be like \"Oh we're missing this\".Also in terms of visuals a lot of reference. There's a lot of current day military and also a lot of cool shapes like movies like Blade Runner, Aliens some of that stuff.

How are they intended to work?", "answer": "So the escape pods will not be functional in 2.0. Longer term they will but probably not for 2.1 but I would say after that. The idea will be you should be able to... especially for the PU you should be able to get into the escape pod, seal it up and get out of there which is sort of your escape when the ship's going down. So the bigger multi crew ships when they're about to blow I think we've sort of previewed some kind of warning and damage states that you got only so many seconds to get out before the thing blows and that will be either getting into your EVA suit and trying to EVA far enough away so the explosion won't hurt you or getting into an escape pod and escaping away which will eject you and probably keep you more safe.Generally if your ship is about to ready blow in the PU especially you would get into your escape pod and the escape pod has a tracker or tag on it, so that's how you would get found and respawn and go back to sort of the last friendly planet you were on. That's how they're intended to work so if you obviously do use the escape pod that's one of the ways to save your lives so to speak otherwise when your ship blows up, then you'll have lost one of your lives and you'll wake up in the hospital after they found your almost dead body and charred and brought you back to life, so yes use escape pods when we have them working that is.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 70", "source": "https://youtu.be/ezrghcBRcSk", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Resk", "published_at_timestamp": 1447716094}, {"objectID": "373681070", "question": "With the plan for AC 2.0 to be a 'baby PU' are we still going to be able to bring the larger multicrew ships into the AC we have now?", "answer": "Yes, what we're basically calling Multicrew, or what we've decided, we made the switch to SC Alpha 1.0 a little while ago, but really, with multicrew, that's... that's pretty much you're going to be getting what we would consider sort of SC Alpha, because you're going to have the full sort of space experience on a huge massive scale. You're gonna have all the sort of combat FPS elements there, you're gonna have social elements, so all the things you see up until then will all be there in one package. So, then you can probably look at it and say, yeah, you could call this an early Star Citizen alpha. It still won't' have landing on planets and taking off from planets and going to different star systems, but a lot of the game mechanics will be there, it'll be sort of the test bed that will be adding into. Now, the question is, would we be able to bring large mulcicrew ships into Arena Commander, which is sort of the game within the game, AC is the sort of practice mode for you to play to make sure that you have a chance to get good at combat before you actually put things on the line with your real ship out there in space. And I would say that, that is the long-term plan. In the short term, the very first release of SC Alpha, what we're calling 1.3, which is going to be the multicrew release, it'll have FPS and social and all those things in it, we won't have the ability to bring you multicrew ships into AC as it stands. You can still do AC, still be ranked, still have the matches, but it will be the set of ships that you have right now. In a subsequent release, the next one, or the one after, we will, cause mainly the issue is there's a whole new lobby UI that you'd need for multicrew ships in an Arena Commander sort of arena battle mode where, here's my constellation, and here's who's going to be in my upper turret, here's my lower, here's my copilot, which we don't have that lobby UI, and we sort of decided because we're building the multicrew release to be sort of this 'baby PU' or 'SC Alpha', you will spawn on a space station and you and a bunch of other people will spawn on a space station like, you spawn on ArcCorp right now on the social module, and you can call up which ship you want on a landing pad that you have from your account, you go to it, and your friends can join you in that ship and then you can take off and explore around and fight other AI that are on the large map or come across other players, or sort of do what you want in a free-form fashion. So, that's sort of the initial way of using the multicrew ships. There's a lot more territory to explore, different locations to find and explore, so I think people are gonna have a lot of fun. We'll be building out and fleshing out gameplay and functionality and features in this sort of map that I think I've referred to in the past as sort of a test kitchen of all the sort of in depth gameplay, and I think when people get SC Alpha 1.3 / multicrew, and play it, that will be the experience to go, okay, I see how all of this stuff fits together in Star Citizen, and I am psyched, because I am pretty psyched. So, that's sort of the goal and then later on, like I said, we will make Arena Commander also work with multicrew ships, and maybe there's classification of you know, the best Connstelation pilot, or the best constellation combat person, because we still have plans for Arena Commander, and also for Star Marine to have more in-depth matchmaking, sort of ranking systems, so that we'll be much more akin to what you would see on you know, Blizzard do very well with their Battle.net stuff. So we'll definitely have that, but we thought the first thing we want to do is get you into this big large world map with your friends and adventure around. So, you won't be able to really do AC as sort of the game within the game with a constellation in the very first release of multicrew, but it will be in a subsequent release. THe one after, or the one after that, and it sort of depends when we can fit the time for the UI for it in, because everyone's pretty much tasked fully on everything they're doing right now.

How are these changes achieved in an engine that physically models ship movement? Do these changes affect manoeuvrability across other ships?", "answer": "Darian Vorlick: This kinda ties in with what TD just mention where centre of mass is concerned, and how there are other factors involved with how ships manoeuvre.Travis Day: Yeah, so there are different ways that a ship's manoeuvrability can be changed, so there's power available, power draw of various thrusters, the power plant itself, the thrusters themselves are unique, so changing them on one ship won't change another. So there's the Power Plant, the cooling, the thrusters, their power output, how quickly they can articulate (if they can at all). These will all affect the final \"feel\" of the ship, so those are kinda the primary things that we mess around with. Sometimes, like the mustang, it's multiple things, here its the power output, the range of articulation, the speed of articulation etc. So the Mustang was a pretty extensive modification.DV: These are all things that the tuning kit can also change or affect, we haven't really established exactly what extent the tuning kit will do things to, or even exactly what it does, but as a stretch goal we want to make it as useful as possible.TD: Some of the things you'd adjust will be derivative of the items themselves, like there might be 4 different types of thrusters you can equip, each have their advantages, one might be super quick, one might have a really wide articulation range, another might be really powerful but fixed, or more fuel efficient one. Within that will establish the basic nature of an item, then you can modify within a range each has.DV: A good example would be to take your favourite compact car and put a ford mustang or a corvette engine in it. That'll change the performance characteristics of that car, because 1) It wasn't designed for that engine in the first place, so you'd need to upgrade the suspension, the transmission etc. So if you're the kinda person that spends a weekend under your car, the same sort of things apply here.TD: And you might want to take some things BACK, for example, if you upgrade your manoeuvring thrusters and your engine, but not your cooling system or powerplant, your might want to tune your new equipment BACK to 60%, or you might be constantly overheating, or not be able to fire any time you thrust up wards.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 04 (2015.03.16)", "source": "https://youtu.be/lstuaA4WsVA", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "SP3CTREnyc", "published_at_timestamp": 1426543213}, {"objectID": "373676670", "question": "In regards to the PU \"Instances\", if I were stalking someone over multiple solar systems, how are we ensured that we will be instanced with that person every time.", "answer": "In that particular case, that the whole point of the \"Person of Interest\" system.

It also goes along with the sense of in-fiction achievements and rewards, where we have a medal display case rather than an abstract achievement screen.

Then when you figure it out, and triangle in on the point of entry, then you're going to have to fly it. That's going to be a kind of skill based flight mechanic. We haven't prototyped that out fully, but the concept of that is you're going to be flying down the equivalent of a huge breaking wave down off the North Shore of Hawaii. If you have to go down the funnel, essentially surf it exactly correctly down the path, as long as you keep on the path and get to the end of it, and depending on the size of it the and the length of it we'll have turbulence and all that. Once you get to the end and you've tracked that, and recorded that in your navigational computer, then you can automatically go back and do it again. Some of those will be more difficult than others, and also the navigation computer itself, well some are better at recording than others, some don't have have the capabilities to do the more complicated ones.

Longer term, we'd love to have ways of having little robots come in and do it for you, but that'll be more post V1.0, adding the very little things like that to make an immersive universe even more-so.

Like \"Hmm, I wonder if I should ask if he's got any work for me\" or \"Nah, I'll just chitchat,\" those would be two sort of inner thoughts that your character would have and then you pick between them and that would determine the direction you would take it.I would guess that's a little in the line of what we did in the Wing Commander stuff with, obviously especially with Wing Commander 3 and 4, but the big thing is that we're doing a lot more about the action and the body language.So where you're looking, what you're doing, what your actions are is also being taken into account in terms of how you're communicating with the NPCs when you're planet side, for a more realistic, or a hopefully more realistic feeling. I mean generally when you engage people, you'll look them in the eye, and if you look away from them and stop paying attention to them, they'll get offended.We're sort of trying to build and model all that stuff in our conversation system. I think it's gonna be pretty cool. I would say that's kind of what we're doing, I mean I don't know this question could potentially be saying \"do you want to have voice recognition or no voice recognition,\" or just menus. I would say our input mechanism is going to be either a combination of menus, or actions that you do.Like if I go up and I look at someone in the eyes, that means I want to talk to you, or if someone's looking me in the eyes and I ignore them and carry on walking on, that means I'm not going to pay attention to you.We're gonna drive a lot of the NPC interaction via your actual actions, which I think's pretty good.

Originally we were thinking \"it's cool, but maybe it's too much of a pain,\" for instance to always have to navigate back, is the planet still there or not?So initially, we were leaning against it, but we're now moving to a full double precision system map, which means that we can essentially cover millions and millions of kilometers, and in that system each entity, whether it's a planet, or a sun, or asteroid field, will have their own location, and we probably will be able to, if we want, orbit them around, then you would travel locally.But we haven't made a full decision whether planets are static or they're actually running on some orbital path. Although doing the orbital thing may be pretty cool. That's definitely something we're considering, before we were thinking we weren't doing it when we had a more fixed system map set up, and now our system map is on one fixed scale and had the ability to be more dynamic, we're reconsidering that.

I mean the Idris is designed to have a complement of small ships on it. I think in Squadron 42 we sort of decided that it has an active complement of two ships. So in the military it's two Hornets, then it has a back-up spare Hornet in case one gets destroyed. And that's sort of the standard core complement on a military patrol set up. So if you have say, two Hornets, you definitely will be able to have them in your Idris. Think of it like big ships have their inventories, and smaller ships have inventories, rooms have inventories. So you essentially move your Hornet from the inventory in your hangar to the inventory in your Idris which is basically the hangar there. Yes, you'll be able to do that. So you'll be well armed, and you should have able to hire either NPCs to fly it or more preferably with something like an Idris, which is really not designed to be a solo vehicle, you and your friends can have fun.

I think you guys are really gonna like that.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 07 (2014.02.10)", "source": "https://youtu.be/-y0GQV_Bx4U", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Viperalpha", "published_at_timestamp": 1392073473}, {"objectID": "373686020", "question": "How will contracts work between organizations and individuals? Will there be a system in place within the game, or organization module, that will allow organizations or individuals to negotiate contracts, insure cargo or assets involved, and finalize payout?", "answer": "So we'll definitely have a system to be able to handle this kind of thing. We may even have a system where you can put money in escrow until a job is performed. Maybe someone administers that for a fee. Also we're going to have a rating system. I think we've mentioned this before, but in America there is this service called Uber where you can hire cars to take you places, and both the person that hires the car and the driver of the car rate the other person. So when you are looking at a car nearby, you can see what that driver's rating is and the driver can also see what your rating is. So you obviously don't want to go with someone that only has a one star rating, you want to go with someone who has a four or a five star rating, and I think that in that case we would definitely have both parties in some contract. When you hire someone like an employer hires someone to run a mission, both the employer and the person running the mission can rate each other so you can sort of see, ok, this is a transport pilot and he's got a 4.5 star rating out of 5, he's pretty good, he's definitely worth paying a premium when this guy's got a 3 star rating over here. So we'll have a bit of that sort of self-regulating objective ratings, and also maybe some systems like escrow and a role that someone can take as an arbitrator for a fee, to arbitrate disputes, I think we'll have system that are fairly similar to what's in the real world to make that kind of stuff work well.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 05 (2014.01.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/RtyZzO5OrE0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "TotkenKopf", "published_at_timestamp": 1389982600}, {"objectID": "1da456ca9cbe24_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Is a fully loaded cargo bay going to affect our ability to speed up and slow down vice our maneuvering capabilities when our ship is unloaded?", "answer": "Yes (see above) [Real inertia is used for all the calculations - the ship's computer is calculating the needed thrust based on the ship's current moment of inertia - which is re-calculated anytime the ship has a part added or taken away. So yes longer skinnier ships should roll quicker (assuming the same powered maneuvering thrusters)]", "user": "AFKeefer", "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12grru/i_am_chris_roberts_creator_of_wing_commander/c6uwzxk/", "published_at_timestamp": 1351771200, "title": "r/IAmA: Chris Roberts", "type": "reddit"}]
