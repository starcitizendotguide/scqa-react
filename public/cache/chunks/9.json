A 30k. If you load back into a new server, how does the player find their ship?", "answer": "Beno\u00eet: Right. So in the case of, so you have a ship, let's start from the beginning, you go to the ASAP terminal and you unstow a ship. So the ship lives, is first in your, in your location inventory, and it's in the global DB. You, request the ship shows up on a landing pad. That's that actually behind the scenes unstows the ship. So it moves from the global database to the shard. Now you can, you can, now it's being actively simulated by a game server. And so there's thousands of updates on it, right. To keep it up to date in the DB. You go in it, you start flying it out. You put cargo in it, you drop some items in it, whatever. Then a 30k happens, right. Server ran out of memory or, you know, something like this happens. Now when you come back to the game, the, that ship is still in that shard. All right. It's still in the persistent database of shard 24, for example. And so if you come back and you're match made, most likely going to be match made on another server because shard 24 is not available at the time, especially if you log in rapidly back in. When you enter your new shard, that ship will not be available for sure. Right. So, but it will be available for insurance claims. What we are looking at, at this moment for this problem, because we know that's a problem, obviously this is not cool, right. Is that when a server crashes, well, we have a dedicated recovery mechanism that we're actually putting in place right this moment. We're working actively on this right now throughout our current stability testing, which will auto stow back the ship into your location inventory. And so what that means is we don't want you to be stuck with your ship stuck in a shard. That's no longer available, right? You were actively playing with that ship. It's got cargo in it. We want you to be able to grab it. And so in the case of a 30k, your, your ship would get auto stowed same as your player, because there's no difference between a ship and a player in this instance. So, that's the goal that we have for 318 is to make sure that that case doesn't happen. So that in the case of a 30k, your ship is just stowed back in, in the exact state it was in at the moment of the crash. You keep your stuff, right. That's, we don't want you to be, you know, stuck with a ship that's unavailable. And then you need to find the shard again. And listen, you know, that's like a guessing game. So we don't want you to be stuck at that.<br/><br/>Paul: I do want to add though that eventually, and that's a great feature of persistent entity streaming, if that server 30ks with persistent entity stream before persistent entity streaming, that means this, this whole world would be dead because the memory is gone. Everything is gone with persistent entity streaming. However, the shard and the state of the shard still exists, right? The server crashed because it ran out of memory or there was a game code bug or whatever. It's always game code bugs, by the way. Yes. It's never the core tech. Anyways, when that happens, we can actually start up a new server, and it can load back that shard and then continue simulation for exactly where we left off. Again, for 3.18, because we don't want to address matchmaking just yet. Um, we will do what Ben just said, where we try to take, locate all the ships and we stole them into your location inventory. So you don't lose your ship and the progress on that ship. However, the ultimate goal is that when a shard server crashes, that we restart a new server for that shard and that matchmaking will allow your player to reconnect to that shard and then matchmaking will be able to do, to resolve the slot for that exact shard. So you start ultimately or not in a next iteration, you will be able to start your client. And there will be a little dialogue, which telling you, do you want to wait for your old shard to come back online? Because obviously it takes a couple of minutes before shard is back online and then you will be able to join back to exactly where we left off. Um, and then eventually the final goal, once we have, uh, complete, uh, the, the server matching and the replication layer and the gateway layers all separated at that point, when a server 30 case, you won't even notice you will still stay connected and we start a new server, or we have a fleet of servers already running, which can take over that work. But that's obviously fine in the future. So what we, uh, what, what we're saying is in this very first version to be on pause, what we have right now, server crashes, we take player and you take the ships, put them all into your inventory. So you don't lose progression. And you do, and you will get exact the persistent state back from the ship at the moment, the server crashed. So you don't lose anything. Um, in the next version, we then try to revive that shard and let you let matchmaking allow you to come back to that shart. And then, ultimately in the, in the final version, it should be all, almost transparent to the player.", "source": "https://youtu.be/jXvIO8vJkgI", "title": "Star Citizen Live: Persistent Entity Streaming", "type": "youtube", "published_at_timestamp": 1663350921}, {"objectID": "191e0131eedbe8_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The Liberator has \"extreme\" range by virtue of the capacity of its hydrogen/quantum tanks compared to other ships of its size class.

The other thing I saw which isn't sci-fi but Battlefield One looked very cool to me because I like World War I so I'm kind of partial to World War I and things like the Red Baron and so, it was kind of cool to see that.I'm sure I'll play it cause I'm a bit of a Battlefield fan but I think you guys will be seeing some stuff from us on the FPS stuff, not too distant future and I think you'll like it cause there's some stuff we haven't shown or shared where we'd made some really nice breakthroughs in how our FPS sort of movement mechanics work and it's playing really nice and smooth internally.

You've talked about consulting linguists for alien languages, are you talking to exobiologists, exoplanetologists, and exo-climatologists for direction and help in designing the ecosystems and climates of alien planets?", "answer": "That's a good question. I, we have done a certain amount of working with a local school here in L.A. actually. So UCLA we've been dealing with some astrophysicists and their ilk, in terms of laying out our star systems and what kind of planets would be what distance from the stars. That dictates the type of planet. To a certain extent what we do is we say \"Well we want this kind of planet\". Then we talk to the folks that really know and say \"So what situation could we potentially get this planet in?\". And they'll say \"Well then maybe it needs to be this distance, this many Au from the star and ...\".And that's so how we on a macro side have been doing the star system map and some of that will filter into the procedural tech. But it's still early days on the, kind of figuring out the ecosystems of the planets and the weather patterns and all the rest of the stuff. I would guess that we would tend to go a little bit more towards a designed approach where it's like taking a look at Hoth. It's an ice planet and it's cool, but is the whole planet covered in snow or is it..I mean it certainly looks like when you watch the movie. Would that be realistic? Would there ever be life on a planet like that? Maybe, maybe not I don't know.But you very much define the planets like, using my Star Wars reference here: Hoth is the ice planet, Tatooine is like a desert planet and so you got, you go to the Dagobah system and it's all like this swampy jungle thing. Very much in Star Wars they focus the planets to feel like it's a type, it's a jungle, or it's an ice planet, or it's a desert planet.So we'll probably do a little bit of that, maybe not quite as much of that. But we'll definitely do some of that, 'cause I think it really helps in terms of identifying the planets and stuff. So there'll be a combination of a little bit of science and what we think fiction or lore wise, kind of gameplay wise would help. So there you go.

We may, let's look at 2.3 or 2.4 and beyond, we may have a rough idea of what we want to be in those patches and ultimately Chris is going to dictate we want in those patches, what content we want to deliver, so it is up to Production to be able to pre-plan all these schedules out.

How is that decision made?", "answer": "Travis Day: For the record, I really like this question because this is a debate in the industry as well.Eric Kieron Davis: Yeah. For me, a lot of times is just comes down to: How much time do you have for the project? How much money do you have for the project? When does the project need to be out? Those will obviously guide the quality of the project. But once you understand at least one of those three - or as many of those three as you can - it helps you make a better decision., right, so you take into consideration hiring people locally versus hiring people regionally or nationally. You look at - for a lot of things in pre-production it's a big ramp up, you're building a lot at the beginning but you're not necessarily at the end, so it does make sense to staff up but it does it make sense to staff up for permanent staff, forever? Not necessarily. So, I think the idea is to try to get as many people in the game industry jobs and to keep us all employed and to have a great time making great games. But the realities do come down to: How do we make this for the best price possible but hit that quality bar we really want?TD: Yeah, and I do think outsourcing gets kind of a bad rap in our industry because it's like: \"They took our jobs!\" or \"It means lower quality\". And actually there are a lot of super talented people out there that do outsourcing work and so it doesn't necessarily mean lower quality. The taking of the jobs thing is the other one that I wanted to address too which is: If you have a guy like Chris Smith. Chris Smith, Lead Vehicle Artist, makes some beautiful ships, made a lot of the beautiful ships that we have in the game - to ask him to make 34 variations of boxes, barrels, and potted plants is... you know, maybe he'd dig it... I don't know, I'm not going to speak for Chris, but it would be a misuse of his talent. Right, because you can't get anybody to make one of the ships that he makes but you can get a lot of different people that can make those potted plants or those boxes.EKD: And for me, giving somebody with more of a junior... or just getting into the industry, the opportunity to work in a game - that's perfect for them.TD: Exactly.EKD: It gives them a sense of: How does it plug into the game? How does it fit in the master system?TD: What's the pipeline... yeah.EKD: Yeah. Right out of school or just looking for a job or somebody between some work... absolutely. Trying to balance giving as many jobs as we can but also the realistic goals of the project without getting this ballooned... anything, budget or schedule, right? It's a balance.TD: Right. That's another thing that a lot of studios struggle with, I mean in this industry for longest time it was just feast or famine, right? So you ramp up, up, up, up, up... and then you finally have enough team to ship the product... and then a quarter to everybody gets laid off because you can't sustain that. And then there was a popular idea: \"Oh, we'll have two teams simultaneously at a studio so that when one project is in pre-production the other project is in full blown production and we've rolled most of team 2 on to team 1 and then once team 1 ships then everybody will roll over to team 2 and we'll do pre-production on team 1. And that one actually worked for quite awhile and that has gone better, I think, but one of the things that outsourcing allows us to do - and this has been really important to Chris - is that you want everybody that you hire to know that you've made a commitment to them. The company has made a commitment to them to take care of them, to nurture them, to grow them in their professional career and in exchange we get this beautiful art, we get beautiful code, whatever it is that that transaction is. And you want to be able to have people have security and trust and faith in the job and outsourcing is a tool you can use to scale without risking not being able to make good on that contract.EKD: Yeah, I think to talk to outsourcing for a second longer: When we say outsourcing we don't just mean taking jobs away from people locally or whatever word you want to use because I think that it gets negatively branded. The outsourcers we use - some are local. They're just called outsourcers because they're not in-house.TD: Yeah. Guys like ?Ether?.EKD: You got it. There's full teams out there that work with multiple studios - they hire on artists and programmers or whatever it is and then they work with companies like us to build their games and it's actually a very large industry. A lot of people are getting jobs because of that outsourcing opportunity.TD: That's the other thing to point out is that their entire business model is predicated on... they make a social contract with their guy that may be a freelancer otherwise which is really feast or famine and unstable and he gets a regular full-time job and they're going out and they're hunting for work basically... getting 20 projects at once and that's how they maintain their company's stability. It's an interesting ecosystem. You know, I never realized how much of a business/production nerd I was until I started getting these kinds of questions that get me super excited.EKD: That's what we get excited about. To kind of go back to your original question, we look at all of those factors and then whatever makes sense for the project at the time. Because no project is the same, even when you're making... I'll throw out Madden 25... there may be some kind of formula but it's still a new project, new tech, new artists, new players on the field. There's still new stuff to it, so it all depends on the project.TD: That's gotta be horrible. They've gotta remake those jerseys every time.EKD: Every time... new pipeline, yeah. Horrible... or you know... fun if you love jerseys.TD: Yeah. I just like to think that somewhere out there is a guy who did nothing but make hubcaps for GTA.EKD: [laughs] Sure did. And he loves it. Full time job is making real hubcaps, part time job is virtual ones.TD: And on the weekends... he installs hubcaps on his car.

I wish I could take that one, I'm actually, well, I can't.  I don't know the answer.  But I want to know too!LP: Okay, so the long and short of it is, the alien races are being fleshed out as we speak.  Their home planets are being fleshed out by the writers as we speak.  The details of those alien races are they're...they're as complex as I think you'd expect them to be, given the scope of the project, but... by that I mean, every alien on Star Trek comes from the same gravity style planet.  In our world, we've got a handful of races that come from heavier G planets, so that impacts the way they look, some come from lighter G planets, which affects how they look.  Something we've been kicking around for a while, and is starting to reflect the way that they look is the Vanduul, they operate on much higher spatial function than humans.  They think very 3D, they operate very 3D, their entire environment's very 3D, and by that i mean we walk on a 3D plane.  We usually drive on a 2D plane.  Everything we do tends to be very 2d.  If you remember the Wrath of Khan, the way they beat him, is, the guy operates 2d, in other words he's going to attack, and then circle back and attack again, and they went in depth.  So these things are starting to manifest right now.  Plants are being worked on by the PU team, which is manned by Mark Skelton, and we should start seeing some of the PU stuff come on-line within the next month, month and a half.  PU and, I'm drawing a huge blank on the other component of the game which is the...Social module.

It will be very fun, it will be very fearful, and we ARE going to do that. I've actually talked about this before, it's one of the best parts of Star Citizen being first person and not tied to your ship is that we can do things like this, so really we're a space-first-person-adventure-simulation game. It allows for a whole range of things, and because we're spending a lot of time building these systems up front in a holistic fashion, there are a lot of things like this we're going to get to do besides just the simple \"Ok, lets fight someone in space\" or \"Beat off the pirates\" or \"Escort this ship\" or \"Collect this bounty\". So we can do things like EVA over to derelict ships, explore them, get attacked by NPC alien creatures that jump down from the ceiling. We're going to do a lot of that in space, or even planetside.

How strictly will they be \"enforced\"? My DUR Freelancer has a stated capacity of 148 freight units. Let's say that I accidentally (or deliberately) try to load 148.5 freight units of cargo. Will there be flashing red lights and warning sirens telling me that I can't load that much cargo or will I be allowed to load it anyway?", "answer": "Well actually the way that our freight units work, is they're actually volume units. So originally we were talking about how many tons of cargo you could carry, but we sort of quickly realized that at a certain level, the tonnage is much less important than the volume, in terms of us building the ships and what they can fit inside. So we came up with a standardized container system at different levels, and so when it's 148, or 20, or 40, or whatever... that's actually talking about the units that can fit in the cargo hold. And so if the DUR Freelancer can fit 148, it won't be able to fit more than 148 - that's the most you can fit. Now of course, how much each one of those units weigh will be an issue, right? So if you're trying to fly with solid gold instead of, I dunno, 148 pieces of... err... whatever would be light - your ship would fly differently in space. And I don't know if we'd have a maximum takeoff load criteria that would prevent you, saying \"oh no, you can't actually take that much mass,\" but basically the freight units is all about the volume and whether you can fit those pieces of volume in there. But in terms of the mass, maximum takeoff, all that stuff, we haven't really figured that out yet. So I don't know - there probably won't, but if there was that's where they would sort of, \"hey, you can't take off with that level of mass.\" I mean we could probably just have you take off with whatever the mass stuff is, and then you're just a really slow ship, which is probably what the solution is as the moment, and we'll make it more sophisticated going down the way.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 34 (2014.08.18)", "source": "https://youtu.be/y4wAP1fWe8c", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Space_Lawyer", "published_at_timestamp": 1408399954}, {"objectID": "124fad58839ae1_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Can you expand some on the options for ship tender on the RSI Constellation?
