Founded in 2409 by Tromo Nivelin, it started out specializing in scouting and prospecting remote areas for viable claims and taking control before the arrival of potential competitors. It began extracting resources from the Pyro system in 2493, shortly after receiving the green light from the United Nations of Earth (UNE). The profits from this venture allowed the company to quickly expand its operations in Pyro, constructing countless bases and space stations throughout the system. In 2516, the company suffered a heavy financial blow when it overbid on what turned out to be a worthless mining claim on Terra (Terra III) that was later revealed to have been based on faulty data. It faced another massive loss in 2539, when the discovery of the Hadrian-Gurzil jump point caused it to lose access to its claims in the Hadrian system. Valuable resources in the Pyro system became harder to find in the 2540s, and the company truly began to struggle. Although the development of improved shielding technology in the 2550s allowed Pyrotechnic Amalgamated to expand into previously unreachable areas, the company was eventually forced to declare bankruptcy in 2563, when increased outlaw attacks and the cost of maintaining their equipment completely eclipsed their bottom line.

With our old system, we had this, it's called lifetime management, and it would arbitrarily remove entities once they hit a certain cap. And we realized that's not really great for play experience. For example, I think at the moment, players can only spawn up to three ships. If they spawn another ship, the old one gets removed. For persistent entity streaming, we actually revisit that problem. And we decided, okay, how can we make this a nicer for the player, but also be how can we make this actually work good for persistent streaming and also for server meshing, where maybe it doesn't make sense if if a player has five ships spawned and they're all separated in open space and streamed out, they don't really cost us performance. So why do we still need to arbitrarily limit that? And for that, we have the guys in Frankfurt developed a new system. It's called density management, and it operates on relative cost of an area. So the idea is that instead of just taking arbitrary numbers on objects, we look at areas and we look at the amount of items in that area. And we only start to remove items the moment the relative cost of that area becomes too high. So as long as you spawn your ships in different locations and they're all spread out, we will never touch them or remove them. However, if like now everyone goes to the same spot and you start spawning ships and spawning ships at the same location, that's when the system will find out, OK, now the performance goes down because our relative cost in that specific area goes too high. And then we will start deleting items, which also follows a certain rule set. So we will delete oldest items first. We will also have a relative priority on items. So a player ship, for example, is a very high priority item. So we would not delete a player ship versus a coffee cup, for example, would be the first item to go away. And then with that, we try to get the game to where it's not very invasive to you. So you don't just see stuff disappearing out of the air. Exactly like the approach we're taking is that most of this cleanup will happen during stream out. So if an area streams out, that's when the density management will make a first initial pass and will say, hey, in this area, we had 50 coffee cups and that's too much. So we start removing them. And then we only go into the more aggressive policies once it's really becoming maybe an area never streams out or whatever. All players decided, hey, I mean, I kind of expect that right once we go get PSL probably everyone will like, let's all go to Port Olisar and drop all our coffee mugs on the floor and keep doing that. That's what you guys will do anyways. So basically the system will take care of this, but it will be a smarter system. It's a smarter system than what we have right now.<br/><br/>Beno\u00eet: One thing to add to thedensity management too, is that it also has this concept of references. And so for example, if an entity, because this also covers NPC entities, right? So like AIs and whatever else. And so if a specific entity is actually being referenced by a mission, active mission or active player, for example, then there's a ref counting, a reference counting system that will prevent those from being actively reaped. So that, again, I think the goal with density management is really to make sure stuff doesn't pop out of your view and break your game experience. But we still need a density management system to prevent overloads. But that's the approach in general.", "source": "https://youtu.be/jXvIO8vJkgI", "title": "Star Citizen Live: Persistent Entity Streaming", "type": "youtube", "published_at_timestamp": 1663350921}, {"objectID": "6fe9e33419e1c_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The HoverQuad was designed to comfortably fit in the back of the Nomad as a companion vehicle.

That- the ships are a very exciting pipeline for Star Citizen. It was one of the earliest- we knew we were making spaceships, obviously (laughs). So that was one of the first things we developed and focused a lot of time on. And as time has gone on, we\u2019ve grown a lot better at making them. We\u2019ve gotten the right amount of staff and talent, which is an incredible talent here at Cloud Imperium, that is all focused on making ships not just match the design of that ship and how it fits into our universe, but also we some very invested, very smart, and very talented engineers on our staff, and Chris himself, all of whom understand what it takes to make you feel like you\u2019re flying an actual spaceship. There are very few people in our world who actually know what it feels like to fly a spaceship- <br /><b>\u2013 yeah, maybe a couple hundred!</b><br />\u2013  Yeah! So we\u2019re working within the boundary of physics. Space physics tend to be easier than atmospheric physics. But we have a couple, we have several developers and engineers that are focusing on how to make this feel like a simulation- how would it feel if I got into my cockpit and flew off this planet, any planet, and enjoyed a space flight? So in the designing aspect, everyone\u2019s involved from start to finish. We\u2019ve figured out what ship and manufacturer makes the most sense, and what kind of ship should go with what manufacturer. You know, like you buy a Mercedes-Benz when you are looking for something, but not a Chevy, they\u2019ll all have different aspects to what they are. We want to do the same with our manufacturers of the future. So we start with the designing idea of that ship, and we have our pipeline set up and established, it\u2019s a very clean pipeline that we are all very proud of. And so it goes to the pipeline- art, tech design, engineering, gameplay implications, the features, systems, how they all interact. And we\u2019ve got IFCS, which is our intelligent flight control system. That is essentially driving- you know, you tell your ship to do something, and then IFCS reacts, as it should in a simulation.

Close to perhaps 25% of our staff are from the EU and given that we support a global community, the language skills they come with are also very beneficial to us.", "title": "The Star Citizen Exclusive Interview: Erin Roberts", "source": "http://wccftech.com/star-citizen-exclusive-interview-erin-roberts/", "type": "article", "user": "Adrian Ip", "published_at_timestamp": 1487289600}, {"objectID": "373674830", "question": "What do you do on a day to day basis to help keep things moving within CIG and what are your responsibilities as Global Head of Production?", "answer": "[Special Episode with answers from Erin Roberts]So there's a couple of things I do because there's one is. Obviously as you say i'm Global Head of Production so that involves a lot more travel in terms of going around the different offices coordinating with the different production faults and making sure we have our plans for what we're delivering and the different masters not only for Squadron 42 but also on the Persistent Universe there's a lot of planning and we're just making sure we have the right resources in the right places and the right, the ownership of which studios and so forth. So there's a lot of that level of things.But also I directly run the UK office and so there's a lot of stuff I do on that side and also when i'm travelling i'm very fortunate to have some very good support staff in the office which keep things moving while i'm away. So there's basically two levels there's one that's a much more global level and there's also just the, much of a micro level on the office level in the UK. So that's basically the two different responsibilities that I juggle a lot. As well as the Frankfurt office is actually part of Foundry 42 and although that's managed by Brian, who does an awesome job over there as well, I have some responsibilities for that side as well.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 80", "source": "https://youtu.be/zvm1jW_Xp_8", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Josh", "published_at_timestamp": 1459202407}, {"objectID": "373675640", "question": "This question concerns mostly Squadron 42, but, in some extent, may also concern Star Citizen: can we expect dogfights inside huge structures (like space stations) where the piloting skills will be the only things that will keep you alive (basically, like in Star Wars, when they fly into the Deathstar)?", "answer": "So that is a good question and I, that is absolutely a goal for, there will be gameplay that will give you that kind of close in dogfighting skills. So in Squadron 42. The Shubin Mining Station is about six kilometres long and there's lots of structure stuff on it and so part of our plans is to have some low flying combat that's happening there. So if you're going after an OMC Outlaw you'd have to go close to it and plan and fire and so have that flying close to the structure. There's other plans to have similar things like in asteroid fields and i'm pretty sure we will also work in that kind of stuff in some cases in the persistent universe 'cause it's just really cool game play and it rewards good piloting skills.The issue with it is mostly is just getting the AI to fly smart enough. They go close and they just whack into it and it just defeats the whole purpose. I think there was one time the asteroids in Vanduul Swarm weren't really on the radar of the AI and so you could just get all the Vanduul to basically ram into asteroids and kill themselves. So the AI's really the hold-up and AI is a big thing for us. It's a big focus right now for the project because there's a lot of AI dependencies in Squadron 42 that we need to finalise up but we want to roll out more AI into the persistent universe.So in Crusader we have some basic space flight stuff but we also want to have folks on the various space stations going about their daily lives and a higher degree of that and also have some AI on FPS combat and stuff like that. Encounters that you could maybe go to a location and maybe clear out some outlaws or something like that.

I mean it's applicable it's exactly what we're working on right now.FS: It's a great question. So our writers went through and they did create clothing manufacturers. So that's something that allowed us to we have nineteen planetary stereotypical locations. Earth, Terra, and so on and so forth.Within that we have the sub-categories which is like the blue collar, the white collar and the kind of the more rebellious ones. Then we have Frontier and we have other stuff and categories. Under that we have specific clothing line manufacturers now.So it works exactly like the ships.EKD: The Writers all established a whole backstory, explained what they were, it helped inspire the look of them.FS: Where they come from and so you're going to be able to play the game and find manufacturers that you enjoy because we have style guides that are associated with each manufacturer of clothing lines and you're going to find like in real life there's certain clothing lines that you like and you're going to want to collect all the clothing.There's going to be different stores across the galaxy that fit the lore of why those stores would be there. So it's kind of a fun mini game in fact. Wear these clothes and go explore and find new clothes It'll be exciting. \"Oh I just found a new shirt from that manufacturer I like\" Stuff like that. It is pretty fun. We have 36 manufacturers, right now for clothing.EKD: I'm sure it'll grow cause it's a whole galaxy out there. The thing is we've got to discover the other planets to figure out what the other manufacturers are. So we'll get more as they come online.FS: Yeah exactly. We want you to discover these manufacturers involved. We don't want to give them all to you right off first. And we just got all our new logos made for all the manufacturers. So we'll have signs.

We're definitely gonna have melee, so in the very early stage of the FPS, it's just straight-up brawling, but in the long term plan for melee, you'll have some basic punch/duck moves. But then you'll be able to different places around the universe (like a Tevarian dojo) and learn some Tevarian martial arts, so then you'll have extra moves to use.From there, when you engage in hand to hand combat, the more moves you use, the more options you have against someone and the more defense you have. And if they haven't had the same level of training, they'll have fewer options to use against you. So it'll be cool &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; if you spend a bit of time, you can pick up some combat moves around the universe. So we'll definitely be having that on the melee basis.For weapon options, we definitely have knives, not really sure about swords or hammers. So in the short term, probably not, but in the longer term, why not? It's not all that different than a knife or some of the melee stuff I'm talking about. Although it probably won't get to the point where two sword wielders can fence, who knows &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; in the long, long, long term future...  :)But generally, I would say you could expect the melee stuff you'd see in a modern world setting.

When it comes to making missions or things to do in the PU, do you create the stories for them first or do they get built based on gameplay requirements?", "answer": "Will Weissbaum: Well, we'll start with the first part. How do you feel writing has changed since we have begun this crazy journey called Star Citizen?Dave Haddock: It's certainly become much more interesting because it's-... now that we're having things come online - conversation systems and actual mechanics and stuff like that - you get more of a direct plug-in of like, you need to write something for this, that needs to accommodate for this system. Rather than before, where it was-... for the early news updates we were trying to write about what the plan was for game design aspects, and now we can actually kind of write about game aspects.WW: The project has definitely gotten to the point now where we're starting to really focus on specific content, and churning out scripts, and getting things done for moving into recording stuff, and really heading into the production phase of things, and moving out from more of our kind of brainstorming and dreaming-of-lore days. So that's kind of fun to see that switch happen - get more focused and lot more panicked... panicked all the time.So the second question - when making missions and things do we create the stories first or do they get based on gameplay requirements?DH: I think at this point we're still building a lot of the mechanics around the PU, so we haven't gotten into specific mission stuff. We're sort of-WW: Tony and the guys have been doing a lot of experimentation with figuring out, like - without story applied on top of it - just how the missions work from getting the player from \"here to here\". So, we're gonna - once they sort of have a handle on that - we'll be able to dive back in and start building up with stories, and how to tie it into this bartender and going to this system, and you know, what are you carrying that's interesting?DH: And yeah, maybe one the process gets equalized it might be a half-and-half type thing. If we come up with something - because we have a better understanding of how it could be implemented - we could theoretically pitch ideas and they could just pitch stuff back to us and go, \"hey we have this new thing - could you do a mission for us?\". So it's probably gonna be a bit more even. Right now we're sort of taking cues from them as to how they wanna-, how they see that sort of mechanic working out.WW: Yeah. And we'll come in more, definitely, on those missions that are gonna be designed to kind of twist your expectations or be a spin on the normal everyday missions. That where we'll come in and-... Squadron 42 - even though you didn't ask - with that it's kind of more we start a very high-level story that sets the initial road map down of where we're going narratively, and then the designers take that and plan locations and more specifics of gameplay. And then they pitch that back to us, and we take it and we start saying like, \"oh, well that's interesting! If they're gonna be in a fight right before they have this big heartfelt talk then maybe we can adjust the fight. Maybe we can, rather than being a big battle, we make it just a one-on-one fight with this guy cos it'll be more impactful,\" and Design says, \"no, that won't work - how about 3 guys?\".

I know I saw a few comments thinking the ships weren't actually flying that fast, but they actually are flying pretty fast.So when you're doing a head to head pass, a lot of times you have to watch it 'cause you're far away, then all this sudden it's right there and you're like \"Oh no,\" and pull up, and if the two people pull up in the same direction, boom.We're gonna tweak that damage, but there's definitely damage that gets sustained in collisions in the dogfighting and in general in space.", "title": "10 for the Chairman Episode 19.

It won't be anything that will happen before the Dogfighting Module, but I think you could see us making some announcements after the Dogfighting Module.Long term we definitely want to do that.We've been talking to the various peripheral manufacturers, and quite a lot of them are keen to do stuff with us about making some sort of Star Citizen themed controllers, and also have say a HOTAS that is specifically configured to work really well with Star Citizen. So you know we map all the keys and all the buttons and the joystick to everything that's happening in the cockpit. That includes being able to have an analogue look around like say on a hat and stuff like that.So we're definitely working on that, and that will be pretty cool.I mean we'd enjoy our official Star Citizen game pads and t-shirts and hoodies, and we'd definitely want our own official joystick and mouse and all that kind of stuff.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 09 (2014.02.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Q4OB9Yfo-0Q", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Dragonfiremalus", "published_at_timestamp": 1393282759}, {"objectID": "373686170", "question": "In the Dogfighting Module, how will you balance ships by class/size?

They both have different pros and cons, so depending on how you're fighting and what you're doing, it may be a closer fight than you think. But we're going to have various categories in the matchmaking. We've been playing with various matchmaking set-ups. One of them is you assign points to ships, so an Aurora would be something like one point, but a Constellation could be five points. Don't quote me on these points because this is just for illustration purposes. Then each team gets to have 30 points or something like that. So you can make the trade off between lots of little ships or a fewer smaller-bigger ships. Then we'll probably also have matchmaking that just Hornet v Hornet or Aurora v Aurora.
