The 89th UEE Navy Logistic Support Squadron were the only military forces in system at the time of the attack. They managed to hold off the Vanduul for two days, allowing much of the planet's population to escape at the cost of nearly the entire squadron. Naval reinforcements arrived on the third day to engage the full Vanduul fleet, but they were unable to hold out against the onslaught. On 23 July 2884, after heavy casualties, Crion and the rest of the Caliban system were lost to the Vanduul. In honor of their sacrifice, the 89th Squadron was retired, earning them the nickname \"the Lost Squad.\" This battle marked the last time a Kingship was spotted by United Empire of Earth (UEE) forces until the Battle of Vega II in 2945.</p><br/><h1>PRELUDE TO BATTLE</h1><br/><p>Small Vanduul raiding parties first began attacking Caliban in 2739, during the latter years of the Messer era (2546 - 2792). While the initial raid sparked fear in the system's inhabitants, causing a brief population drain, the skirmishes were largely casualty-free. As raids continued to occur at a steady rate of between two and five per year, the UEE installed a small naval presence along with system-wide perimeter sensors. The people of Crion saw this response as inadequate; political activism spiked among the populace, but the Messers sent no more aid.</p><br/><p>During the fall of the Messer regime in 2792, the military presence in Caliban was pulled away from the system to repress mass civilian uprisings elsewhere. A medium-sized Vanduul Clan launched a raid on the largely undefended system, which claimed over one hundred lives. The newly formed post-Messer UEE government ordered the 31st Battle Group to Caliban to fend off the invasion. Their efforts were successful in stopping the raid from spiraling into something much deadlier.</p><br/><p>Subsequent Vanduul raids dropped down to previously established levels of roughly five per year, finally peaking in 2859 when a single large Clan clashed with the 31st Battle Group in the system's asteroid belt. This was the last Vanduul raid until 2884. By 2870, the 89th Logistics Support Squadron was Caliban's only protection. </p><br/><h1>THE ATTACK</h1><br/><p>At 04:43 Earth Standard time (UST), 7 July 2884, a Vanduul Clan led by a Kingship slipped past the system-wide sensor beacons. Two pilots of the 89th, on patrol near Caliban IV, spotted the Clan. Both of them fired off a distress signal, but their messages were cut off before they could be completed. </p><br/><p>Not comprehending the scope of the threat they faced, the bulk of the 89th mobilized against the invading Clan. Four ships were lost to advancing scouts before the Kingship was in sight. At the sight of it, CO Commander Sylvie Randall made two snap decisions; first, to send out comm drones requesting reinforcements, knowing that it might take up to two days for reinforcements to arrive; second, to retreat back to Crion to organize and defend civilian convoys. It was this decision that allowed over three million inhabitants to escape with their lives.</p><br/><p>By the time the 2nd UEE Naval Fleet arrived, 49 SE Hours later, there was nothing left to do but rescue any remaining people and abandon the system. The 89th Squadron, along with the Caliban system, were lost. It is estimated that over five and a half million people died, though no official numbers have ever been released.</p><br/><h1>AFTERMATH, ANALYSIS, AND IMPACT</h1><br/><p>No attempts were immediately made to reclaim Caliban. Though the Kingship responsible for the bulk of casualties in battle returned to Vanduul space soon after its victory, UEE forces held off on moving in until casualties could be assessed. The UEE announced in 2891 that there were no active plans to retake Caliban until the Vanduul threat could be fully neutralized. In 2945, military strategists began to discuss possible future campaigns into the system to rout the Vanduul encampments. </p><br/><p>Historians believe that the decades of Vanduul absence in Caliban, combined with a thinly-spread military, poor system-wide sensor maintenance, and an incomplete understanding of Vanduul intentions were what led to the invaders' decisive victory. Though the Tiber, Virgil, and Orion systems had already been abandoned to the Vanduul, military strategists did not foresee an attack of that strength on Caliban. The 89th Squadron was there in full force, but one squadron was not enough to stand against the firepower of a Kingship. In honor of their sacrifice, Squadron 89, redubbed the Lost Squadron, was officially retired from the UEE Navy.</p><br/><p>Vanduul Harvesters are actively consuming what is left of the Caliban system.

Right now we aren't conceiving of same company synergies bonuses. There certainly could be a case where there will be some equipment that say an Aegis ship works has and the only kind of cooler that fits is an Aegis cooler, which is the case in the real world in some cases.So there's that but I would say that in general you would look at the stats of the component and its quality level and that would dictate how it performs and how it would help in your ship. And whether or not there was a bonus because Aegis works better with ... an Aegis component works better with an Aegis ship, I don't know yet, and that's actually something that I will actually bring up because we are in the middle of finalising a lot of our component stats so could potentially be a cool thing.Like maybe there's an extra feature that you get with an Aegis cooler in an Aegis ship. It will still operate as a cooler on another ship but you just wouldn't have the extra, I don't know, fidelity or reading. Which can happen sometimes where you have a cooler, like on a computer, and if it works ... put the Corsair cooler in the Corsair case it's like built for it.

It's probably something we'll start to work on with Craig Grounsoll who's done the sort of landing systems. Still got some landing system stuff that he's wrapping up for Squadron 42, and some enhancements for star citizen, and this will probably be the next task to get this working.It's not that difficult. Basically you just kind of want to get, it's just like the landing system really. You get in a certain area and you say \"ok, dock\" and we just sort of bring you in and connect you, and the merlin would be attached to the constellation, and then hopefully you get out and should just be able to enter into the back of the Constellation.So I do want to get it moving 'cause it's actually not that difficult, technically, to get working. It's really just people have had a whole bunch of other things they are working on first. For instance, you know, we, ah haven't shown it yet, but you know we have an Idris flying around and you can land inside it, and take off inside it, and walk around it, and it's pretty cool.So, that was sort of the higher priority, and we've still got some to do on the bigger ships in terms of building it out, like we have this object contain system which we detailed in our February monthly report that just came out, and you know that's kind of how, well, all the future sort of big stuff like big space ships or space stations and, you know, even the landing areas will be taken care of.It's sort of like containers of geometry and objects and stuff that can be nested inside each other, and sort of stream in and out depending on the situation, and that's how we'll bring in the interiors of the bigger ships and stuff like that.

I've stated from the beginning I want the game to be controller agnostic so I do not want there to be a super class of user that because of their controller they can be better or beat everyone else.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; We do have inherent problem controllers in that some different controller interfaces are good for different things. So, a joystick or HOTAS is much better for flying precisely than a mouse, but a mouse if using a gimballed weapon is better for precise aiming. For the same reason a keyboard/mouse on a PC can school anyone using a gamepad in an FPS shooter.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; So, they have different strengths and I think the right answer in this is to allow complete option, player can have whatever they want, and to make sure the strengths of one thing are countered by a con. Like... yes, you have aiming if you have a mouse and gimballed weapon but your flying's not so good. If you have joystick and you're flying, your flying gives you an advantage that you can use over someone with a mouse.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; We haven't got that balanced properly yet so that's where we've been working on stuff, 1.1.5 patch that's coming out we've still been playing around with some of the stuff.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; One of the big things, we'd announced awhile back was gimballed weapons...the gimbal itself takes up a size class and you have to drop down a size for a weapon&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Problem in the past, the size 1 weapon damage output compared to the size 2 damage output, there was maybe a 20-30% increase between size 1 and size 2. That doesn't make much sense, it should be closer to say twice that much.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; I'm not saying it's twice as much but if you get my drift you have a real pro and con there. The guy with the joystick, he might want to go with fixed weapons so that's more difficult to put on target but when he does, he's doing twice as much damage as opposed to a mouse who's easier to put on target but doing half the amount of damage.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; You've got other things, the bigger the gun gets on the gimbal, maybe the slower the gimbal reacts.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Those are things we are actively wanting and trying to balance. The biggest problem is we have so many things going on and we also have other considerations.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Right now you're just playing AC with single seater ships and dogfighting and the full game(PU) is not going to be all about that.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Multicrew ships are going to be one of the big things. Flying with NPCs or friends and there's going to be a whole different variety of different piloting styles.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; You can't take a Constellation and dogfight the same way you can in a Hornet but other things in a Constellation you'll have an advantage with.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; There's also other things like in AC, there's that respawn mechanic, people fire a bunch of missiles then they kill themselves so they can fire more missiles.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; That's not going to happen in the real game, first you won't want to kill yourself cause that's a pain in the ass. Second, missiles are going to cost credits that you're going to have to earn so you're not going to spam them like that.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; There are certain play styles right now that happen in AC that won't happen in the final game, that can give you an impression that one controller can have an advantage.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; We want to make AC itself a fun experience for everybody using their controllers and each one having their pros and cons.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Also be aware that there are other considerations we are just coming into so in some ways we don't want to be definitive, like, this is what it's going to be like. We have to get the multicrew ships in and a bit more variety happening before we have a good sense of the full picture.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Figure out how to best give each controller it's own pro and con and make them feel sorta equal. Not to say we don't experiment and play around with stuff, I think one of the problems is we held off on an AC patch because we thought FPS was going to be sooner so we haven't really patched anything in AC for quite a few months. That was our sorta balance iteration.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; 1.1.5 has some balance iteration stuff that will hopefully make this a little better, maybe it won't.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; I've made a real sorta commitment now and focus on the team and say, 'No matter what, we're busy trying to get things out like say multicrew, FPS or SQ42.'&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; We can't constantly be iterating on AC and trying to improve that and balancing that and taking people's feedback.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; If I go take a look at being away and come back, it sorta feels like there isn't a lot of new things to play with, at some point everyone gets bored and it becomes more about arguing about things then playing stuff.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; We're trying to get back onto the content and delivering and taking people's feedback and adjusting.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Be patient with us, we're committed to make it a fun experience for all.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; For all means, beginners playing the game have it fun. Then there's detail and depth that more experienced people can get into. You sorta grow with it.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; My goal, so easy to play but hard to master. It's a cliche in the game business but it's a very true mantra of what would make a good game.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; We are focused on that so don't worry the way the controllers are aren't the way they'll continue to be.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Our plan is not to gimp things but to really try and make things have their pros and cons. It will take time to get there and we'll need your feedback.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; BL &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; So to speak directly to the controller balance thread, you would say gimbals are here to stay but we want to balance them in such a way that folks more skilled with a joystick have an advantage over someone using mouse.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; CR &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Yeah, 100%. I can't see any version of the future that you wouldn't have some level of your weapons gimballed. Like Star Wars, there's guns on turrets and stuff but there needs to be a con to that, to a pro on someone's that flying.....Luke and his X-wing didn't have gimballed weapons and he seemed to do pretty good.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; BL &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; He had a magic force.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; CR &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; The Millennium Falcon had it's little turret on it. So, obviously gimbals and turrets for the same multicrew vehicles are super useful cause they won't have the maneuverability that a single seater fighter will.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; We certainly don't want it to be that someone with a gimbal has all the benefits and none of the downside, that's kinda the goal.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; We're committed to making it as balanced as possible. I would say in general, you would see more turrets and gimbals on bigger ships to make up for the maneuverability.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; The smaller ships we're going to try and balance in such a way that you can put a gimbal on it but you're kinda nerfing your ability to do damage.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; We have all this tweaking for power, distribution of that and shields. We've only scratched the surface of that and the physical based damage will also help alot with the balancing. It's early days, ultimately with your help we'll have something maybe not everybody's 100% happy with but I think it'll be good enough for everybody and I don't feel like I'm unfairly hamstrung", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 60 (2015.07.20)", "source": "https://youtu.be/e1Mkcq160cE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "[Uncredited]", "published_at_timestamp": 1437427065}, {"objectID": "373675470", "answer": "Matt Sherman: Yeah.

Ways that we'll do that are still something that we're trying to perfect.Travis Day: And there's a couple of avenues. You've seen the first iteration of what we called ESP, giving people with sticks the opportunity to have a little bit finer control as you move closer to your target, so we can do things like that, attenuating the acceleration curve on the movement of the ships themselves, we can also do things from a game design perspective, like the refactor to gimballed weapons and sizes, so gimballed mounts and the more they gimbal having lower sizes that they can accommodate, so sure you can move around with a mouse and have pretty good aim with the gimbals, but then we'll reduce your ability to do damage based on the size of your weapons, so there's a couple of different avenues, and one of the things I've seen a lot of talk on the forums about, specifically mouse vs. keyboard, and I know we did that... on Around the 'Verse... there was like a controller summit with some of our designers, and one of the things I want to make clear to everybody is that it is super important to us that everybody is able to enjoy the play experience, so everyone can participate and be competitive no matter what peripheral device they choose to interact with the game. That said it is a work in progress, it's still a pre-alpha, controls are normally something you wouldn't do until right near the end of the game, where you start to refine and hone, right near the Beta phase, so while we are actually making efforts on this balance ahead of time, because we are released with Arena Commander, it is something that we will have to continue to balance and continue to tweak and tune, and we do have some ideas about doing more community involvement about that, so stay tuned for that. A little too soon to say, but we have an idea for how we'll actually get you guys to participate more in helping us to tune control devices.RJ: Yeah, and you guys have been really good so far, giving us your feedback and everything you've listed out. I've seen so much detail from the backers already on what they believe should be default configurations, and different types of preferred control types, so yet againTD: And we're listening. Cause how many times have we gotten emails from Chris, cause he's reading the forums, and he's like...'hey, is this real? Is this really a thing? Can you verify cause we've got to change this!'RJ: Yeah, those are... something... those emails. Good to read. But it's good cause it keeps us on our toes, and it makes us believe that hey, we're looking at sometimes a particular feature in the game, and it brings us back to controls, so it's like how can we do better to balance.TD: Exactly, helps us keep focused better.", "title": "10 For the Producers Episode 07", "source": "https://youtu.be/_4Ml0-EedyU", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Alan Parsons", "published_at_timestamp": 1432581761}, {"objectID": "17d189be6aeeb1_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Absolutely!

Is it possible for the pirates to decide getting the extra manpower in is worth the cost, at the same time generating a mission for a player to assist in an attack, and at the same time, could two missions interact causing a PvP engagement to happen?", "answer": "Travis Day: Yes, the idea behind the economic system is that this will be the driver behind what you see when you fly around. CR gave a talk about it a little at PAX East, but basically that system is what is driving what's happening in the space between planets. It determines where trade routes are running, and what they're carrying. So you may see an increase in pirate activity if all of a sudden ships are carrying a more valuable commodity, like unobtanium ore, say, which is currently experiencing a price spike. So this will attract more pirates that are trying to... obtain unobtanium. This all flows back and forth driven by the economy. So if this unobtanium example was the case, if you were flying along those trade routes near a source of the stuff, you'd see a lot more traders as demand is high, and the supply is unique to this planet, say. You will probably also over time see more pirates coming in. That pirate activity will mean more job boards coming up to protect those traders. There'll be player pirates and NPC pirates all there for the exact same reasons. You may then end up in a situation where somebody has a job to protect a convoy and you want to attack it, presto, PvP conflict.Darian Vorlick: Or there might be a job coming up to protect a convoy, and so on a pirate board there might be one saying, hey this convoy is coming through this system soon, and we as a crime syndicate will pay for the cargo they're carrying. Think of the gold rush in the 1800s in California, someone found gold, so many people flocked there, which meant an increased amount of gold out, but it also meant an increased amount of banditry in the area with so much of the stuff being carried.TD: I also like the idea that a pirate syndicate or anybody could post a job listing, and you might not be the only person to take that job, so you might get there and have to fight for the opportunity, or just miss out and be penniless.

Do you see them as viable exploration, mining or trading vessels, suitable for diverse uses, or will they be strictly combat oriented?", "answer": "I think it depends on how you want to use it! Obviously some of the more combat-oriented capital ships are ideal for that role, but they also have cargo holds for trading, and exploration functions as they're armoured and are fairly self-reliant etc. So I definitely think you'll be able to use it for various purposes. Mining might be difficult, but seeing as they have their own hangars you could have smaller mining ships on board to do the work and just offload the cargo into the capital ship. You never know what add-ons we'll do, for the modular systems on the capital ships are huge, so there might be a mining laser and a processing plant or something.At the moment the Retaliator is serving as our modular prototyping ship, it's been built in such a way that you could maybe get rid of one of the torpedo rooms and change it to, say living quarters or cargo for example.

So at that point if there was cargo floating around in it, it would go away. So if you barely survive, or if someone else came along before the instance is shut down that cargo would be there, but once it closes it'll be gone. But we can't really start to simulate every piece of cargo and have it have it's own persistence to keep these instances open independent of you, because that could get pretty sticky pretty quickly. In this case I'd say if you decided to \"hide\" it somewhere, try not to die or perhaps have some friends nearby to come and grab it for you before the instance closes.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 38 (2014.09.22)", "source": "https://youtu.be/hkZG9cNyuAY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "SilentRuin", "published_at_timestamp": 1411423420}, {"objectID": "373683200", "question": "Will players be able to rent out their ships to other players, and if so, how would that work?

You definitely will be able to hire other players to fly your own ships, and so I would think that there probably would be a case where you could rent out ships. We're thinking about some other options like being able to finance a new ship you want to buy, inside the universe, just like you can in the real world. But I would think if you were renting out ships, basically the way it would work would be not so much a used ship lot - although that would be the way, if I'm a player and I just have lost my ship and I don't have the money buy a new one I can go to a, sort of NPC lot and say \"hey, I wanna rent this,\" and they say \"well, you've gotta give us so many credits for a month,\" and you could deal like that. But for a player I would think that it would be brokered on our, what we call sort of a \"mission board\", because that's where you put out requests for people to fly missions for you, or to do things for you, and also offer services. So that's what you'd do. It'd be kind of like the \"craigslist\" of space, which is... \"Okay - have hornet - good condition. Willing to rent for so many credits per... game-turn-kinda-thing.\" But we haven't implement, obviously that yet into Persistent Universe, but that would be kinda how I think it would work.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 31 (2014.07.28)", "source": "https://youtu.be/QWWhhg56IoM", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Dag", "published_at_timestamp": 1406584832}, {"objectID": "373683570", "question": "Are you reworking the Constellation like you did the Avenger?", "answer": "The answer is yes.We are reworking the Constellation like we did the Avenger.We are doing some design modifications to make loading and unloading cargo much easier to maximize the cargo space, and also not have it conflict with the entrance and launching of the Merlin.We're also considering moving the living quarters to the front, near the piloting section, so the back is just cargo and the engine room.I think there were a fair number of threads about that a while ago.

What you have to do to fix them is you would have to take them to a cybernetic repair facility, so there'll be some of those that will be on planets.Potentially there could be equipment for that on a bigger medbay on a bigger capital ship, but it would be sort of like the mechanical version of what you have to have to do for your arm or limb if it wasn't mechanical and we have the same sort of mechanics, like doctors you can go visit on planets, or maybe there's a medbay on a big ship.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 24.
