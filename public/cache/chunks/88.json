Because of the scarcity of records on Banu history due to their cultural practice of not documenting the events of the past, little is known about the origins of their food preparation methods. In addition, their vast trade network, love of experimentation, sensitive palates, and ability to digest almost anything have led Banu to integrate ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures into their cuisine over time. There are nevertheless distinct traits that are typical of Banu cooking. Most crucial are the melding of many flavors and textures in a dish, the importance placed on utilizing the entirety of each ingredient in a meal, and the taboo on food waste. </p><br/><h1>CUSTOMS</h1><br/><p>Typically, Banu have one big meal that is eaten alongside other members of their Souli, and then snack throughout the day. The meal is expected to be a show of abundance, with more food than can be eaten in one sitting. Using their hands, each Banu will take food from the display and place it on plates for ease of mixing constituent parts of the meal to personal taste. The meal is then eaten while sitting partially reclined. </p><br/><p>At the end of a meal, the remaining food is left out, and Banu will come back to it during their work shifts to pick up snacks and maintain their energy. Any food left at the end of the day is then added to the <em>onjussu\u00e6</em>, or \"all-flavor\" stew, a dish that is featured at almost every big meal and is normally eaten as an appetizer. It isn't unusual for a Souli to keep a simmering pot of <em>onjussu\u00e6</em> that is rarely emptied all the way, and is replenished with liquid and ingredients as needed. If properly maintained, <em>onjussu\u00e6</em> can be perpetually cooked for decades. </p><br/><p>Serving utensils are not common; food that cannot be grasped is scooped with personal plates or cups that individual Banu are expected to bring to the table. These plates often have handles attached and are wide, round, and slightly bowled so that flavors can mingle at the bottom. Banu take pride in using beautifully decorated plates and cups.  </p><br/><h1>THE NINE TASTES</h1><br/><p>Banu have a very sensitive palate and can detect a wide range of flavors. When filling their plates at the family meal, they seek a balance of what they refer to as <em>biki ndzotayu</em>, or the Nine Tastes: salty, savory, sweet, pungent (acidic/spicy), bitter, hot, cold, soft, and crunchy. The more tastes included in a single bite of a dish, the better it is. One example of this is <em>ofasa</em>, a popular fried treat and staple of Banu food markets. The outside is hot and crunchy, the inside is soft and cool, the <em>ibifissa</em> meat is sweet and salty, and the <em>angafede</em> is bitter and pungent. Having all nine flavors in one bite is seen as efficient and is highly prized. </p><br/><h1>FOOD WASTE TABOO</h1><br/><p>Banu do not have a notion of food waste. Whereas Humans will peel an orange before consuming it, Banu will eat the entire thing, savoring the bitter rind as a part of the experience. A Xi'an will discard the hard shell of a <em>klom.e'a</em>, but a Banu diner will leave it on, enjoying the mouthfeel of crunchy chitin breaking apart against soft, sweet flesh. It is seen as extremely inefficient and wasteful not to use the entirety of all ingredients. If any part of an ingredient doesn't work in a particular meal, it is saved for later and used elsewhere. </p><br/><h1>FOOD AND EATING SOULIS</h1><br/><p>There is a prevailing cultural attitude that things made by expert artisans are superior to anything that can be made by a hobbyist, and this includes meals. Outside of the maintenance of the pot of <em>onjussu\u00e6</em>, there is a strong preference among Soulis to procure ready-made or easily reheatable meals and snacks from Food Soulis, which specialize in making a handful of dishes designed to produce maximum flavor efficiency and very little waste. These meals are either delivered or picked up at large markets.</p><br/><p>Some Soulis have been known to indenture Banu from recently-dissolved Food Soulis to keep everyone fed. Larger Soulis will typically form partnerships with Food Soulis to keep all their members fed, whereas small Soulis will have their members procure food on a rotating basis and contribute to the pantry. It is considered a caring gesture for Banu to pick up a treat for their fellow Souli members and add it to the pantry. Essosouli are expected to provide their members with especially nice food from time to time, particularly if it has been sourced from distant locations.  </p><br/><p>Dining out is very popular among Banu. Eating Soulis operate public dining halls where they prepare and serve freshly-made food, generally buffet-style. Members of Soulis that have signed long-term contracts with Eating Soilis are among their most common guests, but most will welcome individual paying customers as well. Just as Banu bring their own plates to their meals at home, they are expected to do this at Eating Soulis. Those who come to an Eating Souli without a plate can often purchase one from a nearby Dishware Souli. Rarely, an Eating Souli will keep emergency plates in stock, but having to use one is seen as uncouth.

I like the visual stuff. So, from the standpoint of the way we\u2019re going to run it is there\u2019s going to be a visual indication in the appropriate sort of commodities places, not all commodities places necessarily will have a warehouse window you can see. A lot of them will and I really want that sort of feeling that maybe you had a privateer when you went to the commodities exchange and you can see crates or boxes of the things that you can buy. Now, of course, if we\u2019re on a planet and there\u2019s ten thousand tons of something we obviously can\u2019t fit it all in your view of the storehouse. So what it really is is representation of the general inventory that commodities warehouse, TDD, broker area would have and it actually not dissimilar, in fact it is going to be exactly the same system that runs the shops.<br /><br />So, the shops themselves have an inventory, obviously they\u2019re probably going to have a lot more guns or armour or weapons in the back room then they do on the showroom floor. What you see on the showroom floor even when you go into a shop now is a representation of what the inventory that shop is holding and the same code that runs that is essentially the code that would run the visual representation of a storehouse. In fact the commodity exchange and brokerage is underneath it all, there\u2019s no difference between that really and a shop you might buy weapons or armour or anything else. It\u2019s a place that can buy or sell items, it has X number items and in the case of commodities area the price of it can fluctuate based on quantities. Price may or may not fluctuate so much in shops cause they tend to have smaller amounts. You will be able to get a visible representation in a lot of cases and that\u2019s very much consistent with our feeling of a kind of visceral \u2018what you see is what you get\u2019 world, which is\u2026 cause anything about Star Citizen we\u2019re very keen on that.   <br /><br />TZ: I would just add in that there are a few practical limitations once you start talking about ship shops and some of the larger weapons and stuff. Actually putting them into that area and still giving you a significant selection becomes problematic, so we may give you representative samples of some of the smaller weapons and the bigger ones are basically, pick the size you want via the automated kiosk. Insofar as having that visual element, that\u2019s actually something that you\u2019ve always been very consistent on and that permeates a whole lot of what we\u2019re doing over on the design side. Like one of the more recent examples would be the shopping where some of the initial design actually went more to a minimalistic design where you basically selected\u2026 more like a Grand Theft Auto thing where you\u2019re selecting from a list and one of the things you specifically wanted was to actually be\u2026 it\u2019s that\u2019s tangible aspect of being able to touch, see the white t-shirt, the red t-shirt, the shoes that look like this and not just selecting it from a list of things. So, we\u2019re basically trying to implement that concept throughout the entire interface for the game.<br /><br />CR: Yep, that\u2019ll be good.

The reputation system will hopefully be able to have NPCs respond to players based on how their reputation in the universe, that's kind of the idea behind it. So yeah I think the way NPCs treat you, when it comes to maybe I'm not sure yet, that's what something we have to figure it out but maybe certain missions will become available to you if you have a certain reputation, if you have a certain renown that might open a few extra things for you. It'll be interesting to see once we dig into it how we can integrate kind of like the lore that you're building around yourself into actual missions for ya.Will Weissbaum: Yeah and with 2.0 coming online we're starting to work with designers to dip our toes into the mission structure and think about how your reputation might tie into that and I think it'll be nice if we can get it to a way to where NPCs are omniscient, like there wouldn't be a reason why a shopkeeper would know on site that you're a world class bounty hunter, he's not connected to that world so you wouldn't be queued into that.Hopefully the reputation will make sense that alright maybe advocacy agent would recognize you if you have a strong reputation as an outlaw and now would tie or other outlaws would recognize you on sight and kind of respect you and open up doors that way. But like a random NPC's wouldn't so much know on sight. So kind of figuring out that balance and because there is so many different layers of like winding through different elements that it'll be important to kind of, minimize the options while maximizing in how much impact they have.

It does relate to outside aspects of game development. Which is ratings system such as the ESRB and which rating does our game fall into.

Haha, sorry...So, \"given how many features are planned for the product, how do you make your choices on what will be in launch and what will be in a future patch?\" ... Basically we have product roadmaps for each of the modules, and that lays out our plan - in addition to teams like the core tech team, the graphics team, so I would say \"non-module teams\" that are working on maybe the core engine technology - we lay out all of our roadmaps for each of these teams. We kind of line up these nexus points where there are things we'll be releasing at the same time, there are features coming online at the same time, and as for which features are attacked first, it's kind of the same way that you'd build a house, right? So you build a foundation first, and then you start putting up all of the... uhhhh... oh I've never built a house before... but you start putting out the outside, and then you start building the inside - you know, it kind of follows the standard paradigm. And to that end, I think when you start seeing the base and the core gameplay come online, then you start adding the additional features. It's like, \"okay, you can move now! Where do you move? You can shoot now! What do you shoot?\" and things like that - it's just kind of organic. So while we will not have ALL features that we've been talking about, and all the stretch-goal features that we've talked about, at launch, there's a pretty long-term plan in place for getting all of these things along the way.DV: Even though we have roadmaps laid out for each of these different features, it's also good to understand that these things are moving targets sometimes, based on and adapting to the needs of the company. We may push back a feature based on whether we suddenly encounter an obstacle that we realize that requires more resource and more attention, or we realize that it's a feature that the players may not want right now, and therefore they want something else instead. So we have the ability and the luxury of being able to move these around based on the needs of the game, and what the players are gonna want, and what we'd like to see in the game.TD: That's a good point too, about the constantly changing nature of it. Alex has something he's very fond of saying and is very true, which is \"by the time that you've taken the time to write your schedule, it's out of date and it's wrong.\" So the schedule, the roadmaps, everything is a constantly evolving process - which is good, because it keeps employed!DV: And in a perfect world these are the goals and timelines we'd like to meet, but we don't live in a perfect world, and things require changing on the fly sometimes - and sometimes by the seat of your pants! Sometimes we can-... or at least... a good producer would like to be able to forecast problems down the road, but you know, real life happens - Murphy's law likes to show it's ugly head every now and then, and we need to adjust things on the fly.

The hard part creatively is infusing my feeling/idea/vision of the game across a large team. Since we've been backed to a level that we weren't expecting originally, we've been able to do a lot more of what I'd imagined might happen down the track sooner, but that introduces the challenges of building and growing that team, figuring out how all our groups and studios work together economically and to generate the best content we can.

So I think it will be more along those lines.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 33 (2014.08.11)", "source": "https://youtu.be/XBVkhXGX8iI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Sheppard22", "published_at_timestamp": 1407796258}, {"objectID": "373684960", "question": "Will Squadron 42 or the Star Citizen PU contain content that pays homage to some of your past games (Wing Commander or Freelancer) that fans will pick up on in NPC dialogue, UEE news bulletins, hidden easter eggs, or the like?", "answer": "So all I can say is yes in fact. If you've noticed, we already done it.If you look at the Squadron 42 cinematic trailer we did back in 2012, there's lots of Wing Commander homages there. We've definitely got some. Even in the dogfight that's coming up, we have a homage to Wing Commander.You'll see in the virtual network that you join to do the dogfighting simulation, the company that has created it in 2944 is all kind of a homage. We'll definitely continue to do that, and it will be fun.", "title": "10 for the Chairman - Episode 14 .

The dogfighting module that we're going to be releasing a little later on this year is exactly that.Essentially that is the precursor to the final arena mode that will happen in the game that will allow you and your friends to practice, practice against bots, and have competitions, in a much more arena, respawn model than the full Persistent Universe that has real consequences for losing your ship, but also upsides and benefits.If you want to make money in the universe, and build an empire or even buy a new ship, you've got to be flying real missions where you earn real money because you don't be able to do that in the arena mode with the exception of a \"pro-sports\" level of it. But I'm sure there will be a lot of competition and that won't be where most people are able to earn money, you'll have to do that in the persistent universe.The simulator/arena mode is where you would practice before you go out into the big, scary, wide world of nasty NPCs or nasty other players.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 09 (2014.02.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Q4OB9Yfo-0Q", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "AndiTheKas", "published_at_timestamp": 1393282759}, {"objectID": "373685770", "question": "But what module do you plan next (after dogfighting)? Care to share what you're planning?", "answer": "I'm guessing Naktabar's first language isn't English, but that's cool 'cause we have lots of great supporters from around the world.So the module we're planning to do right after dogfighting is the Planet-Side Module and that one is the module that's more focused on down on the planet-side environment, it's going into say a space bar or into the shops to buy and sell items and goods or, you know, sometimes we refer to it as the social module because we're going to allow, that's one of the modules we're focusing on to let other players be in the shared space and test our MMO backend and maybe interact with other players on a sort of avatar social basis.So that will be the next module that we do after the Dogfighting Module.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 01 (2013.12.06)", "source": "https://youtu.be/QACEabB_8lA", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Naktabar", "published_at_timestamp": 1391813631}, {"objectID": "373686210", "question": "In the Dogfighting Module how big will the space be where we will dogfight and will there be empty space or will there be some nice backgrounds like planets, asteroids, nebula, etc.?", "answer": "Ok, so the dogfight map, the base one that we've built, is 20 cubic kilometers. So it's a fairly decent space to dogfight around in. If you go beyond the boundaries it will be sort of like Battlefield. It will be full of some cool stuff. So we're going to put an asteroid belt in, a nebula, some background planets, some nice background art.
