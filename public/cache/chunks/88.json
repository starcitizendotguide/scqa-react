But for items even that you legally own, that you leave, let's say I have a gun that I legally own and I drop it somewhere in Port Olisar and then I stop playing and then I come back later and I get matchmade into another shard. That gun is still in the other shard. It persists per shard. So everything that's in the game world, so unstowed items persist in each server that they're on. Right? That's why there's a mechanism like insurance to get stuff back. If something happens, that's why there's a mechanism like stowing so you can take them across servers. Obviously, that's a bit of a downer because we have a lot of shards, right, for the moment. But the intent and the goal from this foundational work is that we're going to get to very large shards. And so with the matchmaking changes that Paul hinted on related to matchmaking, then we'll be able to have shard affinity. And so the gun that you left on shard X, your chance of getting back on shard X will be extremely high. For the moment, it's not the case.

I like the visual stuff. So, from the standpoint of the way we\u2019re going to run it is there\u2019s going to be a visual indication in the appropriate sort of commodities places, not all commodities places necessarily will have a warehouse window you can see. A lot of them will and I really want that sort of feeling that maybe you had a privateer when you went to the commodities exchange and you can see crates or boxes of the things that you can buy. Now, of course, if we\u2019re on a planet and there\u2019s ten thousand tons of something we obviously can\u2019t fit it all in your view of the storehouse. So what it really is is representation of the general inventory that commodities warehouse, TDD, broker area would have and it actually not dissimilar, in fact it is going to be exactly the same system that runs the shops.<br /><br />So, the shops themselves have an inventory, obviously they\u2019re probably going to have a lot more guns or armour or weapons in the back room then they do on the showroom floor. What you see on the showroom floor even when you go into a shop now is a representation of what the inventory that shop is holding and the same code that runs that is essentially the code that would run the visual representation of a storehouse. In fact the commodity exchange and brokerage is underneath it all, there\u2019s no difference between that really and a shop you might buy weapons or armour or anything else. It\u2019s a place that can buy or sell items, it has X number items and in the case of commodities area the price of it can fluctuate based on quantities. Price may or may not fluctuate so much in shops cause they tend to have smaller amounts. You will be able to get a visible representation in a lot of cases and that\u2019s very much consistent with our feeling of a kind of visceral \u2018what you see is what you get\u2019 world, which is\u2026 cause anything about Star Citizen we\u2019re very keen on that.   <br /><br />TZ: I would just add in that there are a few practical limitations once you start talking about ship shops and some of the larger weapons and stuff. Actually putting them into that area and still giving you a significant selection becomes problematic, so we may give you representative samples of some of the smaller weapons and the bigger ones are basically, pick the size you want via the automated kiosk. Insofar as having that visual element, that\u2019s actually something that you\u2019ve always been very consistent on and that permeates a whole lot of what we\u2019re doing over on the design side. Like one of the more recent examples would be the shopping where some of the initial design actually went more to a minimalistic design where you basically selected\u2026 more like a Grand Theft Auto thing where you\u2019re selecting from a list and one of the things you specifically wanted was to actually be\u2026 it\u2019s that\u2019s tangible aspect of being able to touch, see the white t-shirt, the red t-shirt, the shoes that look like this and not just selecting it from a list of things. So, we\u2019re basically trying to implement that concept throughout the entire interface for the game.<br /><br />CR: Yep, that\u2019ll be good.

It'll be interesting to see once we dig into it how we can integrate kind of like the lore that you're building around yourself into actual missions for ya.Will Weissbaum: Yeah and with 2.0 coming online we're starting to work with designers to dip our toes into the mission structure and think about how your reputation might tie into that and I think it'll be nice if we can get it to a way to where NPCs are omniscient, like there wouldn't be a reason why a shopkeeper would know on site that you're a world class bounty hunter, he's not connected to that world so you wouldn't be queued into that.Hopefully the reputation will make sense that alright maybe advocacy agent would recognize you if you have a strong reputation as an outlaw and now would tie or other outlaws would recognize you on sight and kind of respect you and open up doors that way.

It does relate to outside aspects of game development. Which is ratings system such as the ESRB and which rating does our game fall into. Because that kind of activity is considered adult only that may bump a rating up to mature or higher. Where in-game violence because it's much more cartoony can be downgraded to like age 13 and up. So whether we'll have it in the game... we haven't really set our ESRB rating just yet. So it's kind of one of those unknowns and it depends on what kind of market you want your game primarily to appeal to. Something like Grand Theft Auto, obviously a lot of adult themes therefore it's going to have a mature rating. Do we want to have that kind of rating? I don't know, it's entirely up to Chris where he wants the game to go. But I believe mass appeal is the direction that we're going with cause we want this game to be accesible by a large audience.

Like the fact that there aren't any humans that were alive during the Messer Era speaks a very different thing about that era, because it's all through, you know, historical fact rather than personal recollection.WW: Yeah, so we're kind of thinking that human bodies have a shelf life, as much as we can extend it. But probably was tech HAS done is improved the quality of those 150 years medically speaking. Like, the senility and other kind of problems that come with old age-DH: - genetic disorders -WW: ... and that kind of stuff has probably been eliminated, so you get fuller, healthier, full 150 years, more bang for your buck kinda thing, would be one way to think about it.", "published_at": "2015-01-05", "title": "10 for the Writers: Episode 02 (2015.01.05)", "source": "https://youtu.be/kVBQxqKnakI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Ajax Wilhelm", "published_at_timestamp": 1420498846}, {"objectID": "373677670", "question": "From a production standpoint; given how many features are planned for the product, how do you make your choices on what will be in launch and what will be in a future patch? Obviously for the sake of getting the game out in a timely fashion not every feature that has been discussed will be in at launch. What kind of feature density could we expect for the first major content patch once we've launched further down the road?", "answer": "Darian Vorlick: Travis, you want to start with that one?Travis Day: Yeah, so first of all I would say that from a production standpoint, I would probably scope your question, immediately, so that we can make it for launch 'cause it's very long! Haha, sorry...So, \"given how many features are planned for the product, how do you make your choices on what will be in launch and what will be in a future patch?\" ... Basically we have product roadmaps for each of the modules, and that lays out our plan - in addition to teams like the core tech team, the graphics team, so I would say \"non-module teams\" that are working on maybe the core engine technology - we lay out all of our roadmaps for each of these teams. We kind of line up these nexus points where there are things we'll be releasing at the same time, there are features coming online at the same time, and as for which features are attacked first, it's kind of the same way that you'd build a house, right? So you build a foundation first, and then you start putting up all of the... uhhhh... oh I've never built a house before... but you start putting out the outside, and then you start building the inside - you know, it kind of follows the standard paradigm. And to that end, I think when you start seeing the base and the core gameplay come online, then you start adding the additional features. It's like, \"okay, you can move now! Where do you move? You can shoot now! What do you shoot?\" and things like that - it's just kind of organic. So while we will not have ALL features that we've been talking about, and all the stretch-goal features that we've talked about, at launch, there's a pretty long-term plan in place for getting all of these things along the way.DV: Even though we have roadmaps laid out for each of these different features, it's also good to understand that these things are moving targets sometimes, based on and adapting to the needs of the company. We may push back a feature based on whether we suddenly encounter an obstacle that we realize that requires more resource and more attention, or we realize that it's a feature that the players may not want right now, and therefore they want something else instead. So we have the ability and the luxury of being able to move these around based on the needs of the game, and what the players are gonna want, and what we'd like to see in the game.TD: That's a good point too, about the constantly changing nature of it. Alex has something he's very fond of saying and is very true, which is \"by the time that you've taken the time to write your schedule, it's out of date and it's wrong.\" So the schedule, the roadmaps, everything is a constantly evolving process - which is good, because it keeps employed!DV: And in a perfect world these are the goals and timelines we'd like to meet, but we don't live in a perfect world, and things require changing on the fly sometimes - and sometimes by the seat of your pants! Sometimes we can-... or at least... a good producer would like to be able to forecast problems down the road, but you know, real life happens - Murphy's law likes to show it's ugly head every now and then, and we need to adjust things on the fly.

I don't know, I don't have a brilliant answer, there are a lot of hard parts. Technically, there are a lot of challenges involved with taking a really robust 3D engine like Cryengine and adapting it so that it work in our setting (Much greater scale than FPS usually, and greater fidelity of network traffic handling). The hard part creatively is infusing my feeling/idea/vision of the game across a large team. Since we've been backed to a level that we weren't expecting originally, we've been able to do a lot more of what I'd imagined might happen down the track sooner, but that introduces the challenges of building and growing that team, figuring out how all our groups and studios work together economically and to generate the best content we can. The goal of the game is to not be 2nd best to anything, so we need to always be \"ON\", never getting complacent.

But, uhh, yeah we're definitely-... we have a huge corporation list. I mean, there's probably... we haven't probably fully shared it with you guys, but internally on our... umm... we have a piece of software called \"Confluence\", which is sort of a business or an enterprise version of a wiki. And we use it, we have all our sort of... well it's where we put our in-universe fiction, development stuff, design documents, technical design documents. And so we have a whole section on the various companies that are throughout the United Empire of Earth universe. So we've spec'ed out loads of them - much more than you guys have seen - and we also have a team of-... we actually have 2 graphics artists that their job is literally to come up with the logos and designs for all these companies, very much like you would on a movie (and they are actually movie graphics design guys). And it's fun, because that's part of building out the universe. I mean that's one of the biggest things that I really love about Star Citizen, is that it's a universe that is going to be real. We're fleshing out every little detail, and I can't say enough good things about the work David Haddock, and Will, and also David Ladyman, and Ben Lesnick do on building out our universe. (So and it's Will Weisbaum by the way, who's our secondary writer - so Dave and Will are the two writers. Because we also have William Lewis who's a moderator - so just not to get confused there). But yeah, we're really fleshing out a huge universe and it's fun! I mean... it's universe crafting!So, having companies that specialize in various stuff, we will always have in-fiction ones.

Not so much that you'd have to learn the foreign language, because I think in the future you would have those issues, right?
