First visited by Humans in 2531, it was immediately obvious that the system had once been home to a previously unknown spacefaring civilization that vanished after an interplanetary war. Although officially unclaimed, the Hades is loosely protected by a mixture of private security firms guarding academic expeditions and sparse United Empire of Earth (UEE) personnel protecting the trafficked shipping lane that runs through the system. </p><br/><h1>PLANETARY SYSTEM</h1><br/><p>Hades, the system's star, is an F-type main sequence star roughly five billion years old. The closest planetary body to Hades is Hades I, a mesoplanet covered with impact craters. Two of its three terrestrial planets, Hades II and Hades III, are in the temperate zone of the system's green band. Hades IV, a terrestrial planet that was cracked in half by what historians believe was an ancient weapon, is located in the green band's frigid outer edge. There is evidence that at one point, most of the planets in the system were inhabited, including the dangerously hot Hades I.</p><br/><h1>DISCOVERY</h1><br/><p>In 2515, the scanners of the tramp freighter <em>Merry Crow</em> picked up an anomaly in the Nexus system. After an investigation, the crew found that it was a previously undocumented jump point. At the time, they were in possession of several hundred freight units of stolen fusion drives, which they were smuggling to the Ellis system. The crew voted to keep the jump point's location to themselves and continue on their route rather than risk arrest by reporting the discovery. Although they planned to return to the jump point and navigate it to determine whether it connected to a known system or a new system, which would net them a much larger payout, circumstances prevented this. In 2529, the ship's navigator Jake Tapps became the only survivor of this crew when a deal went bad and the others were killed in a firefight. Tapps sold the logbooks of the <em>Merry Crow</em> to the Dynamo Corporation in 2531. </p><br/><p>After navigating the jump point, the Dynamo Corporation realized they had discovered a new planetary system and dispatched a team to survey their find. Initial scans revealed remnants of a previously-unknown ancient civilization on most of its planets. One worker commented that the desolate ruins looked like cities of the dead, and the company began to call the system Hades after an ancient Human god of death and the underworld. At first, leadership of the company wanted to proceed with terraforming in spite of these ruins, but when it was confirmed that Hades II and Hades III could not be terraformed under the limits of then-current technology, they elected to turn the system over to the United Planets of Earth (UPE) government and the collect substantial reward money it offered for their discovery. </p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>The UPE claimed the new system in light of its historical significance. Early expeditions were extensive, and xenoarchaeologists excavated and documented a great deal of information. However, the advent of the First Tevarin War in 2541 led to the UPE retracting their protection of the system in favor of directing military resources to the ongoing conflict. When Imperator Ivar Messer I took power in 2546, the newly formed United Empire of Earth (UEE) government continued to leave the system unprotected, leaving it vulnerable to grave robbers. Researchers had to hire private security for protection against these outlaws, which slowed down any new expeditions to a trickle. </p><br/><p>In 2647, the xenoarchaeological faculty of Astravin University at Cestulus (AUC) published a joint paper outlining their theory that an interplanetary war wiped out the Hadesian civilization. Imperator Corsen Messer V grew interested in the possibility that ancient weapons of mass destruction might still be in Hades, and ordered the UEE Marines to conduct a thorough search. Many building sites and artifacts were destroyed as a side effect of this unregulated hunt, erasing untold amounts of possible sources of information about the Hadesians and their way of life. </p><br/><p>It wasn't until the fall of the Messers in 2792 that Humans began to consider claiming Hades again. Hundreds of academic institutions across the UEE signed a petition asking the government to take responsibility for the invaluable system and bring it under their protection. However, the UEE's ongoing conflict with the Vanduul took priority over the safety of an archaeological site, and the system remains unclaimed to this day despite ongoing petitions. </p><br/><h1>HADESIAN CIVILIZATION</h1><br/><p>Most historians and archaeologists believe that the Hadesian civilization existed until sometime between 300,000 and 290,000 BCE. At that point, the Hadesians had colonized at least three of the four planets in the system. Hades II and Hades III were the most densely populated, and Hades I was home to a handful of settlements. It is not certain whether the civilization originated on Hades II or Hades III. Both planets have atmospheres that may once have supported life, evidence of ancient oceans and riverbeds, and are covered in the ruins of demolished cities. Fragments of writing recovered in the system are written in an identical language that has yet to be deciphered, suggesting that the planets were closely culturally related, and that there was trade and travel between them. </p><br/><p>There is strong evidence that a devastating interplanetary war wiped out the once thriving civilization. The surface of each planet is covered in impact craters and the soil is contaminated by heavy metals and radioactivity. It is likely that the atmospheres of Hades II and Hades III were poisoned either through fallout from the conflict or via sabotage. If Hades I had an atmosphere at some point, as analysis of its surface has suggested, it was annihilated during the war. In these conditions, it is very unlikely that any form of life could survive. Additionally, the bifurcation of Hades IV implies that the Hadesians were in possession of a weapon capable of destroying entire planets, which may have been the ultimate instrument of their extinction. </p><br/><p>Much of the artifacts of this civilization were lost thanks to the consequences of this war. Structures and goods that were not destroyed during the fighting were worn down by erosion, and any organic remains decayed into dust. On Hades II in some areas, a deep layer of ash lies on top of preserved buildings, offering the closest picture of daily life in the Hades system at the time of their disappearance. </p><br/><h1>HADES CRYPTID</h1><br/><p>Since the system was open for travel, multiple people have reportedly seen a creature aboard their ships. It was first sighted in 2602 by navjumper Eli Thorn. According to Thorn, he caught something out of the corner of his eye as he was climbing down a ladder to middeck. He described it as a bipedal body with exposed musculature that was covered in blue veins. When he tried to get a direct look at it, the ship suddenly rocked, and it vanished. </p><br/><p>Many such sightings have been reported since Thorn first shared his account, with several people claiming they believe the creature is one of the long lost Hadesians themselves or possibly a ghost of a deceased Hadesian. Descriptions vary; some say the creature has multiple, tentacle-like appendages, while others say it has two arms. Some report that the encounter filled them with a sense of dread, and others feel a sense of urgency, like the creature is trying to communicate with them. All agree that when they try to look directly at it, it disappears.

We don\u2019t want to gate you as a player, we don\u2019t have prerolled skills for you. This kinda comes down to the system versus different mechanics like an RPG game you would design different mechanics or sets for like, \u2018oh here\u2019s my smuggling role set, here\u2019s my cargo role set, here\u2019s my mercenary role set\u2019 and it would have all these separate things. You would be sort of I\u2019m either this or I\u2019m that whereas with us you\u2019re not, we just basically figure we try to simulate an open world. Obviously we\u2019re not simulating it to a level that real life is but we\u2019re trying to approximate it and then we let you pick what you want so really your ability to perform different professions whether you want to haul cargo or whether you want to be a mercenary is more down to the equipment you have. Then also there will be some level of access for missions like for instance, no one\u2019s going to trust you to take a whole bunch of valuable cargo until you\u2019ve done enough missions that have proven yourself as a reliable cargo hauler.<br /><br />TZ: That\u2019s the key point to me, that\u2019s the key point to me which is there are no technical limitations in terms of you doing this but we still want to have just like in the real world, we want to give players the ability to progress. By that I mean that there will usually be entryway points where you can kind of do the junior mining missions, you can do the junior security missions, whatever it is. Then you will build up a personal reputation that\u2019s global, everybody knows how good you are in general at this particular profession versus that one, etc. That opens the door to additional missions and then there\u2019s another layer beyond that which is you can be an incredibly well known criminal but that doesn\u2019t mean the mafia boss here personally trusts you.

For the exact mechanics of it that's still being worked out, but on the idea of splash damage and direct damage shields, one of the coolest things to do with it would be putting the full force of the direct damage shield to the front of your ship, and the splash shield to the back, so if you're doing a strafing run in on a capital ship, you've got the protection against their big guns on the front, and missiles from the guys chasing you on the back.CR: The Vanguard is definitely built to be versatile, the redundancy it has allows you to make decisions and combinations that you couldn't with other similarly sized ships, at the cost of component sizes.

We've now got our 2.0 Music System and this sort of positional Voice Over IP that we want to do.

We are currently tackling each of the components one system at a time. I'm sure you've noticed that we've recently just refactored the coolers that did involve resizing the components because there will be real components in the game, on the ships.Darian Vorlick: Taking up volume.KT: Yup, they'll be size appropriate for their capabilities, placed on ships, with ships that have interiors such as the constellation or the future Idiris or any of the larger ships we will have access to them from the interior so that when we implement damaging gameplay, which were still designing at the moment, you will be able to access them and have a crew member run down the hall, go down to the powerplant that has been damaged and then actually repair that by access the component from a panel say in the hall that contains that particular component. So there will be real physicalized items that are in the game.DV: Treat it a lot like Scotty from Star Trek kind of thing where someone has to go down a fix the shield generator or fix the warp core or something like that.KT: Exactly. So if the engineer does notice that, \"hey we got the coolers damaged, now we don't have cooling on the right side of the ship.\" You can send the engineer down to physically fix that component or perhaps even trade it out for a brand new component and get back instant access to the cooling capabilities that you just lost.DV: So just hope you don't have to run a whole kilometer length ship.KT: Yes, So, that may be a possibility. What does that entail? Well we're refactoring all of our component so that we actually keep in mind the capabilities, the positive and negatives of each of the functions of that particular component. Dave mentioned coolers so cooling capability, power draw, signature, these are things that are going to be integral for how the coolers will work. What we need to do then is get that system in and then take a balance pass to figure out, \"Okay we have a size one,\" let's say, drake ... I don't know if they've actually created a cooler at the moment but, Drake cooler well, where does that sit as far as its capabilities. Is it a C grade item? What does a C grade item mean?We define that and then we can place those on ships that would be appropriate for that part. Size two or a medium sized cooler would go on one of the larger ships. It has it's own determinants and positives which you can decide how you want to output your ship by the purchasing the component or when we have future gameplay which you can salvage components, perhaps you can actually pry one off a large shipment and say, \"Hey this is way better than mine, I'm gonna go and place it on the holotable and include that on one of my loadouts for one of my ships.\" Also in the future we may allow the capability of particular like craftsman to hone certain components so that they can actually improve them. Maybe the get better at improving a certain manufactures coolers and power plants.DV: Tuning and overclocking and stuff.KT: Yup and so that would be great, it would be a great career for someone to be a specialist in.DV: You're a ship mechanic.KT: Yup and then you can earn your credits or do whatever you want to do and become that go to person in the Star Citizen Universe to get better at that particular skill. What else did they ... Oh, so the tuning, So what does tuning and balancing mean? Well it means different things for each of the components. What is ultimately does mean is that we figure out what each of the components do, what their range of capabilities are for their particular stats and then we make realistic ranges for those particular values.We've done a pass of coolers, we're in the middle of doing powerplants and we are in the middle of refactoring shields as a system entirely so we will have shield emitters on the ship that are powered by shield generators. So when you upgrade shield generators by purchasing a new one, you will increase the shield capabilities of your ship. Things like, well a number of faces will most likely be tied to the ships but, the regeneration rate of the ships, the absorption of the shields rather, how quickly it can shunt power from the primary face that you set onto the ship, these will all be things you can upgrade by purchasing new shield generator components.DV: Speaking like someone in the middle of combat, you want to redirect further energy to the front or to the aft or from the you know forward starboard side.KT: So if you have a lesser performing shield generator for example, it may take longer for a shield face with zero health to recover and get back any shield capabilities. So you may consider purchasing or finding a better shield generator to upgrade that particular capability. That may mean more power draw so you actually have to purchase a powerplant that is capable of powering all the components that you decided to fit onto the ship. So that's what balance entails.We're currently, most of our components are outclassing their capabilities so powerplants generator more power than you'll ever need, coolers can cool more heat than you could ever generate. What we need to do is as we implement this components, we need to step back and take a look at what the actual values for the components that we've created, what are those ranges? What are those extremes? How do we figure out how these components fit within those extreme ranges and then figure out, \"Okay, this is the sweet spot for that particular component, and this is where it sits.\"As the player, you decide by mixing and matching the components onto your ships, how they actually work and whether they provide the desired functionality that you want to implement.DV: While still maintaining usability and functionality.KT: Yup.DV: I'm trying to remember correctly, I think Matt Sherman explained it to me. For example the ship had two shield emitters, it could be there's one in the front, one in the back or one left or right, I mean you pretty much have two halves of a shell correct?KT: Right and so.DV: One has four and you've got much more control because now you've gotten quadrants.KT: So those are faces. I want to create six because to me four doesn't quite make a lot of sense.DV: Right.KT: Front back makes sense.DV: And you've top and bottom as well.KT: Right so bubble makes sense, front back makes sense, I think six is the next logical step, but that is a function of smaller ships. Now when we get to capital ships, ultimately what we want to do is, you'll want to have say four shield emitters, one that controls the front quarter, the second quarter, the third quarter and the rear quarter. Each of them controlling their own faces, that way we'll have gameplay in which you destroy the shield emitter or the generators that are connected to the front port faces, you actually have a chance in now infiltrate the ship from the front and give you an incentive to go after the sweet spot in the front that you've dedicated so much time to destroy with a squadron of small fighters.DV: Well now let's say you have a long carrier like a Bengal or Pegasus or even an Idris I mean you set up something that long, you could even have mid bulk emitters so if one of those gets taken out you still have an opportunity to have something sneak in while one of those shields are still on before it pops back up.KT: Right, exactly.DV: We can create some really cool missions.KT: And I think it'll allow players to figure out strategies not only to attack shields, but defend themselves. If you find that you frequently outclass in the front, well let's get some shield generators and upgrade them on the front side because we know that's our weakest point of entry.DV: A very spartan type of attack. Or you can lower one of them and try to lure them into it knowing that's where your main guns are.KT: Yeah, eventually we'll get to actually figuring out how the engineer can do things like shunt power or priority to those shields and so, this is a big discussion on one of these systems and we're doing this for each of the components as we go down the line.DV: It's pretty exciting stuff.", "published_at": "2016-02-22", "published_at_timestamp": 1456181823, "question": "In regards to the component system can you discuss some of your recent accomplishments with this.

How will selecting those pads, landing, and keeping those pads occupied work? Or will you just not be able to land until there's a clear pad?", "answer": "I don't think we have ever talked about 1000 players per server. I think the number we wanted was between 50 and 100 and currently as of the social release we are at 25 and hoping to bump that up significantly with the next social release. In the game right now we have to do quite a bit of optimization on the space ships and vehicles because they are very heavy  and they are not as simple as just a player because I think just a hornet itself has 70 items that all work and do their own thing and have to be networked so they are much heavier than a person running around Arccorp but with the game we have a whole bunch of optimization stuff we are going to do next so we can have much more ships flying around. So there wasn't talk of 1000 per server instance. There was talk of something that was a longer range goal that was the possibility of multiple servers to work cooperatively on one big area or instance so if that was the case and you had 10 server then every server would handle 100 people then potentially get 1000 people but that is a long term goal and it does have some issues because at some point you run into rendering issues and all the other things that would happen. But in terms of arccorp I think we have discussed having more than one but it's segregated in such a way that the landing pad to the customs to going through the customs that is to allow us to almost instance the landing pad area so while you go out someone else could be landing in that pad while your ship was put away in its hangar somewhere. This is all stuff we want to get moving as smooth as possible.

For even a smaller ship, actually for a smaller ship, I think it would be a minimum of probably 30-40 people. And this counts everyone who is in the initial design meetings, the initial art review meetings, any concept artists, this includes the person doing the modeling and the lead who's going to be guiding them through the modeling, even if they're not doing the modeling themselves. So everyone who is going to be touching a ship or giving guidance directly on a ship, a smaller one, assuming you can keep the count down in most of the areas, like, minimum of 30 and 40, and that's before QA and that's before bugs. Usually when that comes along those numbers go up a lot, because you have a ton of people touching the ship to make sure everything is the way we need it to be. When bugs come in you don't always get the original artist or designer or programmer who worked on it, sometimes you get who is available and knows how to fix that kind of bug, so it can really balloon up at that stage.But if we're just talking about the development stage, very first draft before it goes to QA, the pre-production, the production, about 30 to 40 people for a smaller ship.That doesn't include marketing or any of that.

So, in a nutshell it's going to be a ubiquitous yes and no.Eric Kieron Davis: Sure... and I think to your first question about when you're working on something brand new or someone is working on something they've never worked on before how do you bid out that work to understand the full scope of it.DV: And how do you set realistic time frames.EKD: Yeah, that's a very very great question and it's very difficult.  Especially if, let's say you don't work in the industry and you just want to make a feature for a game that already exists or get an SDK and start building something with a designer and a programmer and an artist.  You've never done it before so how do you bid it out.  That's a great question.  The biggest thing is you try to use folks who have done it before.  Right?  We try to reach out to people who have done it before.  First within the company &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; go, \"Hey, have you worked on this before at a previous company?  Or even here as we have multiple locations.  At your location, how did you do that or what would your bid be for that?\" to kind of give us set timeframes.  If you don't have that at all, it's just kind of an instant.  Right?  It's breaking down that task with the person who is going to do the work the best they can, go, \"I think that would be this amount of days and this amount of days,\" and you just schedule that out and then you'll likely be wrong... hopefully too long so you can go, \"Look, we go it done sooner!\" but that's not always the case.  So, sometimes it's just trial and error and that's how it is when you're doing something you've never done before, right?DV: Ultimately it becomes a kind of skill set that you just kind of develop over time.  If we're developing a brand new torpedo model.  Historically you look at &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; okay, Dan developed this model in three days, Patrick animated it in a day and a half... so if this is going to be much bigger how do we scale it up?  Okay, last time it took us four days so let's add a couple extra days for QA time, some play testing... so let's make it a week.  So kinda start learning how to gauge things like that but ultimately any time you put a schedule together for production purposes &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; almost kind of a golden rule is the minute that you put that schedule out it's going to be outdated and wrong right away.EKD: That's right.DV: Because scheduling is always going to be just a series of best guesses anyway.EKD: That's right and our job is to update it every day and move things around every day and bring up red flags where we're like, \"Hey, the original idea was this.  It looks like we're not going to make that date.  Are we all okay with that?  What should we shift around to make that happen?  We do that all the time.", "published_at": "2015-07-13", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 09 (2015.07.13)", "source": "https://youtu.be/ouf5jzk9qg0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Gravy", "published_at_timestamp": 1436825509}, {"objectID": "373682380", "question": "Do you think development of Star Citizen will become more stable (better to predict the timeline) after the FPS, Instancing, Large World and AC 2.0 are finished? Or will be a lot of friction when all this is integrated? How do you balance this problem of integrating new features and stable/predictable development between the main development branch and our live/PTU branch?", "answer": "Travis Day: So, that's a good question and actually you know high five we got our first producer relevant question on the show...Eric Kieron Davis: Woohoo!TD: Yes, so to answer your question. Really some of the things you highlight in here are things like FPS, Instancing, particularly Large World, and what we're really talking about when we talk about those things are new features and they're definitely, for the CryEngine at least, new R&D features so they require a lot of work from the programming team and there's an end goal of what they want to achieve that's kinda set out from the beginning but the route there is not immediately clear from the very beginning. So, it's something you kinda discover as you go, so one of the things that you will see is that those features are far less predictable. They have a lower predictability quotient to coin a term. So, yes, that does increase our inability to predict the timelines on these things and then it cascades into other things. Well, if something relies on Large World and we don't quite know when that's going to be then we don't quite know when the dependent thing is going to be and as you get closer and closer it all becomes more clear and it's kinda our job to maintain and update, maintain and update and keep as clear a picture as we can at any given time.So, to answer the specific question of will this improve the predictability once these things are done. The answer is as we get closer and closer to the end of the project and there's less and less R&D and less and less new feature work and more just content pushing that becomes infinitely more predictable. Content is something that is much, with the exception of design content, but I'm talking raw art assets or we need to make these levels, I mean that's much more easy to waterfall and it's far less unknown, so yeah that will get much more predictable and much more quick as the project picks up and we're kinda hitting - at this point we're around the knee of the curve when we're going to start doing more just straight content production and cut down on the feature production. So yeah, I hope that answers your question and thank you it was a good one.EKD: Yeah, good question.", "published_at": "2015-06-22", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 08 (2015.06.22)", "source": "https://youtu.be/m5eFAdJXXSE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Bjoern Schwartz", "published_at_timestamp": 1435010541}, {"objectID": "1461a6da3198c1_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Yes, all Starfarer owners will have access to the VFG industrial hangar (also known as the \"asteroid hangar.\"", "published_at": "2015-05-11", "published_at_timestamp": 1431295200, "question": "Are the older Starfarer owners going to get the VFG industrial hanger too?", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/14710-Q-A-MISC-Starfarer-Part-I", "title": "Q&A: MISC Starfarer - Part I", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "1b156c1b0cc914_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "There will be room for internal options, as intended for most of our larger ships.

That said, will science-oriented vessels like the Carrack be able to use their non-combat equipment in novel ways against aggressors, beyond their standard applications?", "answer": "Good question, I think we're definitely building in the idea for electronic countermeasures etc, we have certain ships in development that have specific systems to allow that to be one of the things you can do as crew. I'm not so sure that those features will be necessary or present on the Carrack, but we are making the bigger ships capable of heavy modular customisation, so you could plug-in and use different tech on different ships etc. The two prototyping ships we'll be using for that new tech are the Avenger and the Cutlass to start with, which is being handled by the UK studio at the moment, and it's pretty cool stuff, can't wait to show you guys. Even the Hornet or the Aurora's functionality comes from the items that are plugged in at any given time, they both have a radar item, they both have CPU etc, that runs a targeting computer, lights, weapons, missiles, shield generators, thrusters, power-plant, cooling systems, all of which \"plugs in\" via the pipe system and balances between each other to create a ships's systems as a whole. The same would go for an ECM station, which might need power and CPU cycles, but would provide electronic warfare functionality. You'll probably be able to plug in modular systems like that on the Carrack, although I can't say 100%, but the general systems are there and we ARE planning on the modularity. In AC 1.0 we run signatures now, so you create these signatures based on your systems present in the pipeline, so you might be able to hide these behind an asteroid, or turning down your power etc, which will make it much harder for a radar to detect you or a missile to lock on. I think all of this will allow for much more varied gameplay options rather than just straight-up combat which'll be cool.", "published_at": "2014-12-15", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 48 (2014.12.15)", "source": "https://youtu.be/znxm9bFAH5Q", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "RandomTask", "published_at_timestamp": 1418684434}, {"objectID": "373677980", "question": "The addition of allowing users to create API's to remove or automate many pleasant/tedious aspects of gameplay have been vital to keeping previous games alive.

What we don't want to do is have an API that might allow players to run around and say, auto-mine or do any of that kind of stuff because it sort of defeats the purpose of existing in the world. We are placing a lot of emphasis on not making the player do tasks that would be considered tedious, doing the same thing over and over again that doesn't have much challenge, so I would say, we're not going to allow automation of any gameplay.", "published_at": "2014-11-17", "title": "10 For the Chairman: Episode 45 (2014.11.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/qXwybQaAbbs", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "ChronicSilence", "published_at_timestamp": 1416257116}, {"objectID": "373678420", "question": "Could you explain character customization?

So we are definitely looking at changing the face up, having a combination of morph targets, and having different chins, and noses, and eyes, and foreheads and all that kind of stuff. We've been debating about how we can do a technique that can sort of prevent people from making, like obviously non-realistic-looking people. But in general I think it's gonna be inline with a lot of stuff that you would see in other MMOs, although we're hoping to try and do it in a more sort of in-fiction way that keeps you in the world. And then of course you can put all sorts of manner of different clothes on - so that's a huge amount of customization, in terms of just the clothes you wear, or the armor you're wearing, or the spacesuit you're wearing. Various different sort of eye-wear, 'cause we're gonna go with the augmented reality, so you can have the equivalent of Google Glass or even a contact lens, or sort of a monocle. Different hats, helmets, all the rest of the stuff. So I think there's a... you know... you will be able to be pretty customizable. We're even considering putting... sort of potentially allowing you to do some level of tattoos, although that's still not 100% been decided. But I would say that, I dunno whether you wanna say \"near infinite\" but definitely as many options as you would get on a traditional MMO.

Will the market carry most/all items in the game? Will prices be player driven? Can players only make profit by transporting goods to another system or can they buy low/sell high right where they are?", "answer": "So the market and what's available will depend on what people want to sell and what people want to buy on each different planet/landing location/city. It'll be very unlikely that everything will be available in all places, in fact that definitely won't happen. Some bigger places like Earth/Terra will probably have a wider selection, places like Earth probably have a lot of demand for manufactured things, but much of that manufacturing will have moved off-planet. Terra is probably similar but has more manufacturing capability etc. One of the keys to trading in SC is buying or making stuff and taking that to a place that might need it to sell higher. I want to enforce the mechanic that makes you fly around and visit the universe, so you won't be able to get every thing at any store, so there might be a really great manufacturer of ballistic weapons at this one particular planet, you'll have to go there to get that brand. Perhaps there's a business opportunity in buying a lot from that place and maybe selling them on a place like Terra, where prices would be higher. The economy will be partially player driven, so if you DO buy a lot of these weapons and sell them on Terra as the supply increases and demand is satisfied prices will change to be lower to reflect that. So there will be an effect of player actions on the economy, it won't be OVERBOARD, we have a large universe simulated with millions of NPCs and the player base will be a portion of that, so there's no way (hopefully) that players could completely unbalance the market, as the plan is for them to make up about 10% of the market where the rest is AI. So a large enough portion that they will definitely be able to affect local economies/prices. Generally you'd have to transport stuff to another system to turn a reliable profit, though that doesn't mean you'd have to do it yourself necessarily, you could hire another person or NPC to do it for you and just stay on a planet and run a trading empire without going anywhere, but probably a little boring.", "published_at": "2014-09-22", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 38 (2014.09.22)", "source": "https://youtu.be/hkZG9cNyuAY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Hux1ey", "published_at_timestamp": 1411423420, "time": "6m35s"}, {"objectID": "373679230", "question": "In the long-range plans for development do you think there will ever be an opportunity for players to join the game without a ship package and take part in the ground activity, travel via shuttle/liner, take jobs on ship-owner-operator's crews? I think just letting those folks into the universe would win them over into the game as well. Perhaps even a guest account option?", "answer": "Yep, Strad, that's a really good suggestion. It's actually something we've discussed that perhaps maybe instead of a trial period where someone gets to try out a ship, they can maybe enter the universe and then they can take a job for hire, or be hired by someone, and then if they want to migrate onto things like ship ownership then they would have to sort of pay their \"ship license fee\" - which would be your initial package to get into the game. So we sort of considered those structures for the longer-term stuff, and also like if you lose all your credits and you don't want to put more money in then of course you still should have ways that you can work for other people to earn enough money to get a ship back. And so we're going to have all of those mechanics in the game anyway, so I think long-term that's a potential way to maybe get some friends in, and get other people to play. Short term it's not gonna be there, but definitely I think our systems will allow it, so it is a pretty good idea.But I think first off we'd want to get the game working for everyone that backed it, making sure it's all good, and then we could see about how it would get expanded.", "published_at": "2014-08-11", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 33 (2014.08.11)", "source": "https://youtu.be/XBVkhXGX8iI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Strad", "published_at_timestamp": 1407796258, "time": "4m55s"}, {"objectID": "373683190", "question": "Currently the player's interaction with the world is through a large \"Use\" icon appearing for vague activation zones and non-detailed input panels.

We've definitely talked about the need to have a more sophisticated, higher fidelity... because we are planning on having you, like, if you want to turn on your engines, and turn them off, and turn on your HUD, you have to hit the switches to turn the stuff on on your dashboard. So we sort of need a little better idea that just \"use\" when you're generally in the area. We're sort of thinking about things where like, maybe the object gets slightly brighter, or has a shine on it, or you know the default would be it would have an outline around it - so you know which it's telling you you can use, and go from there. But that's still in development in terms of how that would work or what it would do, but that's definitely part of our plans to be able to do that, because we want you to interact with the world, and use and turn things on, and not have it be as imprecise as it currently is.", "published_at": "2014-07-28", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 31 (2014.07.28)", "source": "https://youtu.be/QWWhhg56IoM", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Nobyn", "published_at_timestamp": 1406584832}, {"objectID": "373684900", "question": "There has been some talk about gravity generators being part of the ship mechanic.

This is actually something we've been working on.The first person shooter team has actually gotten zero-g movement to a nice stage. We're gonna add more stuff, but you will essentially, if the gravity system gets turned off in your ship...By the way, this is something you could use to mess with borders. Borders come in and you turn gravity off, then you're in zero-g. So unless you've got magnetic boots, which we're also gonna let you have, you'll float around. When you're in zero-g, we're also gonna let you push off walls and other elements, and certain suits will have thruster sets that will let you maneuver in zero-g.So it's gonna be a whole level of extra gameplay that's gonna be super cool, that's pretty different than a lot of the first person shooter gameplay that you're aware of. If you've seen Gravity with the pushing off, we're gonna have all that plus the thrusters maneuvering, which I guess you also saw a little bit in Gravity when they're outside, and you can use the gravity/no-gravity as a sort of a defense mechanism.And if you're storming a ship, it may be a good idea to have magnetic boots that you can turn off and on. When you want to be walking around, you use the magnetic boots, when you want to get into zero-g, you just turn off your electromagnet and then you're floating if you push yourself off.", "published_at": "2014-04-07", "title": "10 for the Chairman - Episode 15 .

Not all TR1's are the same. Ones by a better manufacturer, ones that are overclocked, ones that are slightly higher grade couldprobably put out more thrust than say a cheap, low-end TR1. But you are pretty much guaranteed that a TR2 will be at a higher \"band\" than the TR1. So if you step up to a TR2, even the low end of that will put out more than the highest end TR1. Also when you go from TR1 to TR2 to TR3, don't assume that it's a linear progression. Especially on some of the later thruster ratings, those can be geometric. So when you're moving up to the capital ship sizes, a TR6 could be double what a TR5 is for instance. So you should think of TR1, TR2, TR3 more like a car engine where you have a V8, a V6, a V4, or a V12. Obviously the ones with more cylinders probably put out more power. They can easily put out more power than a 4-cylinder, but a 4-cylinder can still be fairly powerful and obviously there is a lot of variety in the power 4-cylinder engines can put out. That's kind of the idea with thruster ratings. A TR1 represents a band of thrusters or a certain level, TR2 is a step up, and TR3 is beyond that.", "published_at": "2014-02-07", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 02 (2013.12.13)", "source": "https://youtu.be/qwbU9FG5XlQ", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Princjeps Trajan", "published_at_timestamp": 1391813687}, {"objectID": "c5db40a694ea7_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Again, if so, will there be a Black Market for pirates or people wanting to buy higher gear than they can buy legally?
