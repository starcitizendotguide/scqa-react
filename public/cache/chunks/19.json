That's all you need. I definitely think there are some people out there who just like the idea of supporting this. For them it's their hobby. I have friends who aren't necessarily into computer games but maybe they're into golf, which can be a pretty expensive hobby. I like to play games, I don't buy antique cars and restore them, or play golf, or any other middle-aged person's hobby. So I figure I'll spend a couple thousand dollars on games, I'll budget where I'm going to spend that, on World of Warcraft or EVE Online or whatever, because I like what's happening and I want to support them. It's nice to have that level of support, but by far the majority of the people who have backed it have paid $40. What happens is, it's much more of a headline to write about a person who's spent $100 or $1000. Longer term, people who have spent a decent amount of money in the game will have more value than if they'd spend $1000 or $10k on a Kickstarter and got to have dinner with a developer. Most of our stuff is related to the ships you have, and dollar to the actual in-game cost, the money cost is significantly less than the in-game cost. Some of these ships, like the Idris, are massive capital ships. As an individual, maybe Bill Gates could afford a carrier. Nations buy those things, not individuals.

Or is it purely a trade item?", "answer": "Will Weissbaum: We've been talking about how various narcotics and medicines are going to work in the game and it's something we have to develop a lot further with Design. The Endeavor was a great first step in talking about how that awesome science ship is going to tie into hospitals and creating medicines and stuff.We already have a great example of a light narcotic use, when you go to your fancy bar in your hangar and you drink some booze you'll start to see your vision get all blurry and stuff, so I think that's a first indicator of how we'd like to see narcotic use progress in the game. That if you go through the effort of taking a drug it should have some fun, weird effect to some extent. To what extent still has to be figured out: I could see taking a stim that lets you run for slightly longer time because you're all jacked up and then maybe afterwards you crash and you can barely move, or stuff like that.Or maybe it will just be recreational drugs that make things go crazy for a little bit: that could be really interesting too. So definitely things we want to explore in having that kind of gameplay balance will be important to work out with the designers.As far as manufacture that would also be really neat. Hopefully we'll allow players to produce medicines and what are drugs other than than ...Adam Wieser: ... illegal medicines that you take to feel good.WW: [faux serious] That you shouldn't do!

What we are doing with procedural generation is that it's deterministic and deterministic is that it will always deliver the same outcome every time that you visit that location. Now normally how it is, for instance is that you have a planet and that planet happens to be in this 3d location well that 3d location can be used to be sort of the magic number you use to generate that surface of the world and so that planet will always be in that 3d location therefor it's surface will always be the same because you are putting in the same magic numbers to the procedural system to  generate that. And that is the key to the procedural generation system so when you look at something like no mans sky you can go and come back and go and come back and it will be the same sort of planet when you do that because it's based on all sort of maths and magic numbers and planets here in this location or whatever particular seeds they are using for the procedural system in general. So yes that is the case and generally things could change on it but you would same the delta and changes on it on that procedural location so if it was an asteroid and you came and mined it, mined some of the voxels we would have an asteroid with sort of it's starting state the delta of the voxels get taken away and that sort of determine the current state of that asteroid.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 65", "source": "https://youtu.be/sw5N3ivfkds", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Xanik", "published_at_timestamp": 1441674839}, {"objectID": "7750f82bed035_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The Vanguard is designed for landing rather than on-orbit rendezvous.

Could I become a project manager in my current company and one day take the jump to becoming a videogame producer?", "answer": "Eric Kieron Davis: Great question!Darian Vorlick: It is, and there's a lot of yes and nos to that.EKD: I think the reason this one's so tough is because there are so many intertwining responsibilities for these two roles.DV: Yeah, they have a lot of overlaps.EKD: The term gets bandied about differently based on region, based on organization, based on company, based on people's previous experience.  There are a lot of similarities.  There are a lot of crossover.  We do budget reviews, we do schedule building, we do team management, we do personnel management and even within CIG we have some project managers and some producers and we are overwhelmingly intertwined quite a bit.DV: Yeah.EKD: So, to your first question, yes there are a lot of similarities between the two and it's a lot of preference based on the company itself and based on what their previous experience has been.  And then to your second question, could I become a project manager in my current company?  Yeah, totally.  Absolutely.  There are skills that you would learn at a regular software company doing project management, specifically project management...DV: There's even certifications.  Like PMP certifications on Scrum.EKD: Absolutely.  These are all techniques that would help you understand what it would take to get a project done within games.DV: A good example of this is my brother.  He is a technical project manager for another video game company and he actually doesn't actually touch the games himself which is why he's not considered a producer at that company.  He is an internally-facing producer.  So, in that company, he is considered a project manager because he deals a lot more with the console side of the technical aspects of it.  Where people on his team who are actually game-facing, they are considered the producers at that company.EKD: Yup, totally.  You've seen it where some companies will deem somebody producer because they may have a little more creative input, let's say, than a project manager.  So, it really does depend on the company and it's more important to look at the job description more than anything else, or what the person's looking for, if you're going for a job as one of these two roles.Both:  Good question!", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 09 (2015.07.13)", "source": "https://youtu.be/ouf5jzk9qg0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Wintermute", "published_at_timestamp": 1436825509}, {"objectID": "1535d07204504b_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "At the moment we're envisioning only one type of fuel.

Particularly because as things come online asset-wise, we're sort of jumping around - we're not writing it from start to finish. Whereas something like a news dispatch for example, which we sort of alternate on, week in and and week out... I mean sometimes we'll sort of say, \"hey, I got an idea. I'm thinking about doing this for Tuesdays's thing. What do you think?\" and maybe talk it over, and other times it's just sort of a, \"hey, I wrote this out. What do you think?\" type thing. I mean, we review all of the stuff we write.WW: Yeah, Dave definitely reads pretty much 99% of everything that goes on, so he takes his Lead Writer position very serious.

In reality-...Darian Vorlick: Interesting analogy!TD: Heheh. I would say the thing that we spend a lot of time on, and Chris is very adamant about, is making sure that we have one consistent design that works for everything. So (just because it's top of the mind for me, it's recent) the FPS for example having been heavily designed out of the Illfonic office - huh, that's weird I can \"Illfonic\" now and it's okay! I'm used to saying \"redacted\". Being heavily designed by Kedhrin and his team at the Illfonic office, one of the things that's always been very important to Chris is making sure that that design is thoroughly reviewed by the Squadron 42 designers, and by the Persistent Universe designers, and making sure that those designs work for them. And if there are things that don't work for them, or need to be changed, or added, making sure that's all part of the conversation at the inception of the FPS modul, so that it's all going to be consistent throughout the entire game. He does not want to have things that play differently in single player versus multiplayer versus the PU, and so that has been a very important thing to do, and we do that basically by constant communication between all the studios. I would say a large part of our job is basically communication of information and dissemination of information.DV: I mean that's pretty much the job of a producer, is maintaining open communication between department. Whether it's nightly hand-off emails because everybody's in a different timezone - when the UK is getting out for the night we're just getting in, and vice versa, so there's always this constant overlap of duties. With a constant stream of communication that makes sure, \"alright, here's where we left off. This is what we need you guys to pick up on,\" so there's always some kind of consistency in everything that we do.TD: Actually that's a good point to bring up too is that, even though this is \"10 for the Producers\" this is really \"10 for Two Producers\". It is a global team effort - we've got producers in Foundry 42, in Austin, Texas, in Montreal at Illfonic. We've got a lead programmer that works as a producer at Moon Collider. I mean there's people all over the world who are involved on the production side, so big props to the whole team on that one, 'cause its an ongoing effort.DV: On top of that, if it was \"2 for 10 Producers\" it'd be really crowded.TD: Yeah. We'd need a bigger camera.DV: But more to point, also, it's asked that \"when different producers working on separate modules-\". There is a lot of responsibility overlap. We don't have a producer who is dedicated specifically just on \"this item only\". We have the luxury of being able to be involved in various projects, so for example, my contribution is Arena Commander and also the spaceship missile system, and a few ancillary responsibilities here and there. But those responsibilities overlap with some of the stuff that the UK is working on, and what Austin is working on, so we have our fingers pretty much in everything. So on top of that it also helps kind of maintain that overall consistency between the different projects and different modules.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 01 (2014.12.08)", "source": "https://youtu.be/8Vjztd8mgjw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "SmartAce", "published_at_timestamp": 1418080393}, {"objectID": "373678120", "question": "The current lore is quite the web of things to keep in mind.

What's being done to make it feel different from cargo shipping?", "answer": "Well I think the biggest difference on the 890 is there's a focus on sort of communal areas, and being able to fly around with other players, and not necessarily have to be performing a role. So you could just sort of hang out. I mean I'm actually kind of big on the idea of providing a sort of virtual space or area, whether it's in your hangar or on say, a big ship like the 890, where you can wander round and you can go from a destination. Because you're not going to be able to just instantly transport to a different planet - you're gonna have to travel there - and so I actually long-term like the idea of even having, like, passenger ships! And, you know, \"okay, I've got to go pick up my ship and it's on Terra, but I'm on Earth,\" and you don't have a ship to fly there or don't wanna fly there, perhaps you'd board a passenger ship and take that journey. Or perhaps some other player takes that mission on to take you to another place, and you play as a passenger.I just think there's so much more possibility and depth with us having all these different roles you could do. And that's kind of what I thought the 890 would fun for, is sort of like a ship for you and your friends, maybe your organization, and, I dunno... it could be the pimped out version of the organization headship if you don't have destroyer or an Idris frigate. And it's definitely cruising in style! And we definitely want to have some stuff where it can be about sightseeing or, like, pulling up in your big yacht and watching a Murray Cup race. I dunno, just for me personally I like the idea of sort of doing different roles, different things that simulate various aspects that you actually would see in real life, and you get to live a bit of a fantasy, 'cause you know, who wouldn't want to be Paul Allen or Larry Ellison pulling up in their massive yachts to the harbor of Monaco, watching the Monaco Grand Prix - it's pretty cool!So that's kind of the idea. I mean of course the 890 will do other things - it will be able to carry some cargo if you want, you can ship around your M50, or your X85, or another ship down in that hold... and it's pretty well armed so you can certainly defend yourself. So anyway, there you are.

Probably third week of May I would think would be a full roll-out, but we'll see. We could be doing a slower roll-out second week onwards, just to scale it.But in the case of the Dogfighting Module, at the beginning you'll be able to join, if you're in a ranked match you automatically get matched to other people, and then if you want to set up a private game, you can say \"Here's my private game\" and give your code out to your friends and they can join. You could tell the members of your organization or friends to type this code in and this is how you'll join my match.So that's the basic stuff that will be in the Dogfight v1, but there is Dogfight v1.1 and 1.2. We have a plan for a full lobby system where you'll be able to do pretty much everything you can do in most multiplayer games in terms of lobby systems.So yes, you'll be able to set it up for anyone in your organization can join, you can launch it and make a private match, public match, etc. To be in one of the ranked matches, you have to be part of our matchmaking system, which means you basically get what our matchmaking server does.Obviously we want to make sure that when you're getting ranked it's against random opponents, not people who you've set up to be able to beat easily.", "title": "10 for the Chairman Episode 18.

Which won't necessarily be the case. Some of the exploring stuff is gonna be off the beaten path, and therefore won't be somewhere that everyone will naturally go to.So in certain cases, in the exploration mode, we're probably going to have it tuned in such a way that the ability for a PvP encounter in that exploration mode wouldn't necessarily be as high as being in a notorious, lawless, pirate system.Now that's not to say there won't be any chance of it at all, 'cause there definitely will be. There has to be some risk, there has to be some tension when you're in the unknown, you don't know who you're gonna come across.I think that's definitely gonna add to the game experience, but the goal would be to balance that. There's a whole bunch of things that we're gonna try and do. I know we always have raging debates between PvP and PvE on the forums and everyone's pretty much dug in. It's intractable, it's like an argument on religion or politics, but my naive hope is that I have pretty good system that will hopefully make both sides pleasantly surprised and deal with most of the issues that everyone's worried about.But we'll see, we have to wait until we get there. So I would ask everyone that you wait until that happens and also we do key balancing. We've got some tricks up our sleeve, I think we'll make it work well, and everyone's got to remember there's gonna be a huge amount of people from both sides, PvP and PvE, playing this game.I know that everyone on the PvP side feels, \"Well if there aren't PvP people there that I can fight, then who am I going to be able to take out easily?\" Which doesn't make much sense, because there's no reason why NPCs aren't going to be as tough as a normal player, and vise versa on the PvE, \"Well if everyone's PvP, they're just out to gank me.\" Which also I don't think is necessarily true.But we certainly can make sure that people that have a preference one way or another tend to be grouped together when they play, and that effects what they're doing in the game.It's sort of a delicate balancing system, there's a lot of metrics that will go into it. I have some pretty good strong ideas, I mean all I can say is that people should take faith in the fact that the game will be balanced in the way that I'd like it to be played, and the way I'd like it to be played is, I'm not extreme on either side. Some days I like to be competing doing PvP, and some days I like to be doing PvE and I don't want to be dealing with other people.So the game is going to allow you to have those experiences in such a way that it won't be detrimental to the other experience.There you go, I'm sure there will be a massive forum war raged on this right after this episode.", "title": "10 for the Chairman - Episode 14 .

So it's going to be pretty cool, we've actually expanded it more than we were conceiving because of the needs of Squadron 42. I think the Corvette owners will be very happy when they finally get their hands on one.Although it's taking a while, it's a big ship. It's the first one we're building the full insides out properly, which we didn't even do on the Bengal carrier when I was first doing the prototype. We did the bridge on that then the landing deck and the exterior, but we didn't do all the interior rooms and corridors.So we're doing that on the Corvette, but the default equipment or ship load out on the Corvette is gonna be, they fly with two active Hornets, which run the patrols, then they have a third Hornet which is in reserve in case one of the others gets damaged.That's how the military one's set up, so I would say generally you could assume you can fit three ships, Hornet size or smaller, aboard the Corvette, and probably fly two, maybe if you want to get pushy, fly three off.But really the flight deck is built to retrieve and launch two at a time and the third one goes into a storage area.I hope that helps answer on the Idris Corvette.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 09 (2014.02.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Q4OB9Yfo-0Q", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Khastor", "published_at_timestamp": 1393282759}, {"objectID": "373685780", "question": "In the dog fighting module, how will ammunition and missiles be handled if there is no store or economy to reload?", "answer": "Ok, so the idea with the Dogfighting Module is that you'll start in the hangar and in the hangar you'll be able to load up the holotable and then you'll basically use that to decide what your loadout is on your ships, what ammunition you've got, etc. and then you get into the cockpit of your ship and you fire it up, and then the outside of the cockpit sort of turns into the holodeck and now you're in space and then you fight there.But when you're flying in the Dogfight Module actually out in space, you can't reload your missiles or anything like that, but between battles you'll be back in your hangar and you can adjust your loadout.That's kind of the fiction, the fiction is you climb into your cockpit and it goes into simulation mode.

I just feel like that's a much better test of the ultimate game situation we need all this code in, and we've actually been working pretty hard on that and we've actually made some really great progress. We're ahead of where we thought we would be, which is really good news. I kind of want it plugged in because it's the glue, the persistence, that goes between the Dogfighting Module and the Hangar Module, and the future things like planet-side and the Boarding Modules, and that also moves in with chat and like we talked about with the organizations, how those are getting set up. The chat channels we even have on the website, player chat crosses into the game. So we'll definitely have the chat channel between dogfighting and the hangar. That's why I made the delay. The idea is you'll start in the hangar and then you'll equip your ship, and you can even chat with friends and organizations in the hangar, say \"Hey all, let's get into a battle.\" Then you can equip your ship, jump into your ship, fire up the hangar, and go to the matchmaking screen, which is basically a HUD element that you'd be seeing in your ship going in to simulation mode, and you'd have chat available to your friends list and all the rest would go in there. That was one of the major reasons why I just felt like it was better to do it right, take the time and have the proper system in there rather than put a mid-way solution in, which would be using the existing CryEngine back-end tech which we would then have to throw away.
