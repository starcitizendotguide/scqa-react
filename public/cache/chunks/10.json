Discovered in 2493 by Pyrotechnic Amalgamated, it was not claimed by the United Nations of Earth (UNE) due in part to the dangers surrounding its star. Instead, it was exploited by corporate interests until the 2560s, when the potential resources extracted from the system stopped outweighing the increased cost of maintaining equipment under a volatile sun. Pyro became a haven for outlaws by the early 2600s. Today, it is mostly populated by criminal factions that frequently struggle against one another for dominance. In 2947, extremist group XenoThreat seized control of Ruin Station, making them the de-facto leaders of the Pyro system.</p><br/><h1>PLANETARY SYSTEM</h1><br/><p>Pyro, the system's star, is roughly 11.3 billion years old. It is classified as a flare star, or a variable star that undergoes dramatic increases in brightness within a few minutes, releasing powerful bursts of radiation. The closest planetary body to it is Pyro I, a terrestrial planet with a dense atmosphere and a silicate crust. Of the other terrestrial planets, Bloom (Pyro III) is the only one with naturally habitable conditions. Monox (Pyro II) has enough oxygen in its atmosphere to allow a person to breathe without protective equipment for only a short time before deadly health consequences set in. Those who visit the surface of Terminus (Pyro VI) can breathe there for long periods of time, but not comfortably. The gas giant Pyro V has six true moons. The planet Pyro IV, which was likely knocked out of its original orbit around the star by a massive celestial body, now circles Pyro V as its seventh and outermost \"moon.\"  </p><br/><h1>DISCOVERY</h1><br/><p>In 2463, the watch officer of the Earth-flagged tanker ship <em>Roustabout</em>, Raj MacEwan, detected a strange signal in the Cano system. He conducted an analysis and compiled his findings into a detailed report, which he sent to the owners of the ship, Pyrotechnic Amalgamated. The board of directors chose to take no action at that time. In 2493, CEO Cecile Uchiha ordered that legacy flight records be reassessed to factor in advances in jump point detection technology. MacEwan's original report was found during this review, and the company dispatched an exploration ship to the region. After careful investigation, they discovered a jump point at MacEwan's coordinates, and entered it to find what would later be named the Pyro system on the other side. </p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>Pyrotechnic Amalgamated celebrated the discovery until surveys revealed the existence of the flare star. Although scans of Pyro II had found valuable mineral deposits, the unpredictable bursts of radiation from the system's sun would make their extraction with the technology of the day a costly endeavor. The company made the decision to report the discovery to the UNE, planning to collect government subsidies that would fund their operations and guarantee future profits. Uchiha personally reported news of the discovery, and Pyrotechnic Amalgamated was granted first crack at the system when the UNE opened it for commercial activity.</p><br/><p>While the UNE gave corporate interests like Pyrotechnic Amalgamated the green light to enter Pyro, they held back on allowing full colonization. The flare star presented a completely unknown quantity, one that could have disastrous effects on Human life. Government officials elected to conduct a voluntary ten-year pilot program that would document the effects of the star's flares on Humans. If the conclusion of the study was favorable, they would sanction colonization and officially claim the system. However, the program became one of many that were cut short in 2499, when Project Far Star located the Magnus system and the Senate voted to channel all possible resources to the terraformation of Magnus II and the construction of a new center of shipbuilding for the UNE Navy. In 2516, when more funds might have become available, the discovery of the Terra system funneled any available capital towards the development of the naturally-habitable Terra III. 2523 brought the advent of the United Planets of Earth (UPE), and along with it, a complete reorganization of the government. The question of what to do with Pyro was put on indefinite hold, and the system remained unclaimed.  </p><br/><p>Over the next few decades, commercial interest in Pyro waned as valuable minerals became thin on the ground and government subsidies dried up. After the end of the First Tevarin War (2541 - 2546), improvements in shielding technology allowed the few companies that remained in the system to extend their operations to previously unreachable areas, but this also increased the presence of outlaws as they too gained access to this tech. Eventually, bandit raids made turning a profit impossible. Some companies were forced to declare bankruptcy, including Pyrotechnic Amalgamated. By the end of the 2500s, almost all corporations had pulled out of Pyro, paving the way for outlaws to become the dominant force in the system.</p><br/><h1>CULTURE</h1><br/><p>Instead of having formal, organized government, competing gangs rule over the Pyro system, creating a series of fiefdoms that are subject to change if the local dominant faction is ousted from power. Gangs that hold particular strategic points are seen as more powerful than others, especially those who control Ruin Station and the drug labs within it. Many gangs maintain strongholds on the surface of Terminus, the planet the station orbits, that they use as launching points for attacks. </p><br/><p>Outside of its criminal organizations, Pyro maintains a moderate population of mostly Human inhabitants whose main occupation is survival. Monox's mining infrastructure, long-abandoned by its former owners, houses squatters who will fiercely defend their right to live there in spite of its hostile environment. Those who live on the naturally habitable Bloom have an easier existence, but still struggle day to day. Joining a gang and attaining its protection is largely seen as a way of attaining a better life, and many choose this path if it's made available to them. Still, numerous others refuse the option, preferring the known risks of subsistence living over the constant dangers associated with gang membership.

Which will probably be the hardest nut to crack, except the new item system.", "answer": "Sean Tracy: Are you serious?Forrest Stephan: Except the new item system.ST:  He put that in there, the guy new, the guy new, he's like they're gonna answer item port system.FS: Of course it's the new item system.ST: So I wonder is the guy's name Drew or Drug? Or Droogah?FS: Druh, Drew, Druff.ST: Druff.FS: I don't know, I can barely read.ST: Awful. Okay so which feature beyond Item Port because the Item Port one is really tricky and yeah I'm trying to answer with the Item port.FS: Well I'm just gonna go ahead and do it. It's the Item Port system and we can go into other things, but I'm gonna talk about it anyways because it is the biggest headache so far because we're working on it all the time and you're working on it constantly.ST: Mhm.FS: So the biggest thing that we're dealing with right is all the characters for example are going through a major transitional phase. They're going from what, CryTek uses CDF's which is a type of XML where you tie all your items together, into a sophisticated item port system.ST: Yup.FS: And you've currently been working with Engineers on building this tool and so now we're going to be able to build characters as items with this new item port system which is super helpful, but at the same time it's difficult because you're trying to support everything that's previously existed because you don't want to break everything for design.ST: Exactly.FS: Cinematics, but yet you want to push forward and use the new tech so like it's difficult to support both, but you do have to make the transition.ST: Yeah, it's one of those infamous problems where you've done everything right when you have exactly what you started with.FS: Right.ST: Which seems to make no sense. So visually right and Forrest hits the nail on the head with this one. Again the CDF setup was great for Crytek, it's really hard to maintain hundreds of characters with that sort of system. The other thing that didn't work for us on a coding... programming side is every independent piece of the character, actually needs some component code to go with it.FS: And it needs persistence, right?ST: And it needs persistence, exactly. So because of the new item layout we can actually have different code running, different functions running on different pieces of the character itself rather than you being one character as a whole, you're actually a collection of a lot of different gameplay components that are being updated differently than other things. We kind of didn't really answer is question except the new item system.FS: Yeah and..ST: Beyond the new item system, what else hurts us? Like the character one is a hard one.I would honestly say just the full scale because we're' doing the full scale solar systems now and that's something that I really think is gonna end up out to the community sooner rather than later, is the full size solar system itself. I think that's gonna be the hardest nut to crack. We've already got all the support in it, but it's all the extraneous stuff that we haven't thought of yet or haven't even seen. So we've got QA starting to run it through these full scale tests and then not only will we have full scale, but likely at some... I don't know if it's gonna be at the same time, I'd like to see this happen all to together, is we put one of the \"procedural\" planets within there.FS: Right.ST: Now I call it \"Procedural\", it's gonna be the designer controlled planet. So we put one of the planets into the full solar system scale and then we see all the problem that, that brings.FS: Yup.ST:  Right and then we've got to start fixing these..FS: We're combining these fulls systems or full solar systems with procedural planets,ST: Exactly.FS: With the player customization and the backend.ST: Yup.FS: The persistence so your character is your character going forward and all these things come together which are all 100% necessary for  this project.ST: But how awesome will that be because that is the last piece.FS: But how great is it gonna be because that's really.. We've done so much of the development for art and the content and figuring this stuff out.ST: Sure we're always doing a smaller scale version right, smaller scale and this is finally everything.FS: And this is what brings it together right? It takes all these things we've been working on these past couple years and finally puts these final pieces together.ST: Exactly. So it's Large world, item port, planets working.FS: It's super exciting, but like anything we know it won't be easy, it will be a headache and it will be difficult, but we will achieve it and it will be conquered and it will be awesome, but you know there will be problems.ST: But yeah you guys will see this sooner rather than later.FS: Oh for sure yeah.ST: Because we're doing the testing now.FS: We're doing the testing now,  Awesome. Any chance.. How did they know about that new item system, I wanna ask, I'm gonna ask you first.ST: I bet you Chris talks about it all the time.FS: You think this is one of our internal employees asking this question just to mess with us?ST: Oh you think so?FS: Maybe?

Exactly and I don't really know the goal of the restructure it's definitely not to take away from that it's actually to just keep enhancing that.FS: It's to concentrate the disciplines.

So basically what we primarily want is people to be concise, clear, clear steps running through things you started doing but also include ... sometimes you're only reporting the thing that you saw and what you were doing when you saw it, but sometimes what you were doing before that impact things.Like we had certain situations where people were getting disconnected while joining Crusader they would just tell us \"hey, I got disconnected when joining Crusader\" but, you know what, it was because they were joining Arena Commander before they transitioned to Crusader and their tokens weren't getting cleared and that was the issue.So as much information as possible they can provide is usually the best for us because then we can pick through all that information and get really good steps for the developer so they can actually get a fix in.RV: So I know with like release notes and stuff we have ... do you guys set the release notes?VS: Yeah.RV: So maybe in there we can be like \"hey guys, can you focus on this?\" Do we do that right now?VS: We don't do that right now.

Once we have multicrew ships and FPS combat working, we're going to move to bring the two together and in what we've always called Arena Commander V3.0 which is \"Capture the Idris\".

So the opportunity go and hang out with everyone at Gamescom at the big 2000-full event and all the rest of the stuff - that's all great. We've got PAX Australia coming up a little later this year... so those are all kinda the fun things, and it's kinda fun to share and reveal stuff as we work on it, and get people excited by them.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 34 (2014.08.18)", "source": "https://youtu.be/y4wAP1fWe8c", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "G.C.G.B Nash", "published_at_timestamp": 1408399954}, {"objectID": "373685600", "question": "You still have the complete OoB for the Battle of Austerlitz in \"glorious 15 mm hand painted miniatures.\" How many men per figure? How many figures per regiment? ... And did you paint them all yourself?", "answer": "Not really a Star Citizen question, but... Obviously I can't put the entire order of battle, but yes these are some of the miniatures. The rule set that I was having them built to was Empire 3. It has been so long since I actually played these 'cause I essentially started putting this together after my ill-gotten gains on my first Wing Commander which was 24 years ago, and whenever you're making games, you don't get to do as much game playing as you want to do. But yeah, I had a whole, in my old Austin house I had a whole room built up for battle with a whole bunch of geo-hex and all the rest of the stuff. Of course I was also making games so I didn't have as much time to paint everything. So most of this was actually painted in the UK and then shipped over to the US. Although some of it was painted by me.Here is the small Hussar regiment. They're a light cavalry French regiment. That was all done by me which I think I enjoyed a long time ago, but it's also pretty painstaking. But yeah, so it sort of sits there and one day I will hopefully play the battle again. But I haven't managed to do it for at least 20 years. Although I keep all my miniatures around which is more than this selection you can see here.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 07 (2014.02.10)", "source": "https://youtu.be/-y0GQV_Bx4U", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Dreamrider", "published_at_timestamp": 1392073473}, {"objectID": "373685970", "question": "May we disable our weapons systems in order to meet the energy requirements of a high capacity shield? In turn, if shields do go down, can we forward power back to the weapons systems on the fly?", "answer": "So yes, the answer is absolutely yes on that. That's part of the core design so that you're able to do a huge amount of energy management. You know diverting energy from powerplant to your engine thrusters, to your shields, to your weapons, and even inside you shields, depending on the shield set up you have. You'll probably be able to divert power between the different segments of the shield as well and even between the different weapons. So yes is the answer there.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 05 (2014.01.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/RtyZzO5OrE0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Commander Pika Pi", "published_at_timestamp": 1389982600}, {"objectID": "14ef4b17d5b756_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Considering the unexpected (to me, at least) high percentage of players that are interested in exploration (28%), what changes are you making to your plans on ensuring that exploration is a rewarding and sustainable career in SC?", "answer": "We probably should have let people chose multiple choices as that's what the game lets you do, as I suspect its not just about exploration.<br/><br/>But I think we'll do the obvious things like the discovery of jump points / systems, but also having hidden locations / items inside systems - maybe in an asteroid field, maybe cloaked in a nebula - that people can search for.<br/><br/>And if and when we add a new alien race beyond the already established ones, we could let first contact go to the person that first arrives in that system", "user": "MiccoHadje", "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12grru/i_am_chris_roberts_creator_of_wing_commander/c6uwq1v/", "published_at_timestamp": 1351771200, "title": "r/IAmA: Chris Roberts", "type": "reddit"}]
