The holiday involves public festivals adorned with decorations in black and green and private gatherings convened to remember and honor the dead. Celebrants dress up as people who have passed away or in other costumes and swap scary stories, especially pertaining to mysterious incidents in space. It is seen by Humans as a day that gives equal weight to the joy of life and the macabre.</p><br/><h1>The Vara</h1><br/><p>The holiday first originated around 27 October 2557 after the disappearance of the <em>Vara</em>, an exploration vessel orbiting the second planet in the then-recently discovered Hades system. Communications from the <em>Vara</em> to the Rhetor system stopped early in the morning, after captain Tisiphone Heptane sent her initial impressions of the ruined alien cities. Systems on board ceased transmitting ship status reports a few hours later. Though search and rescue teams were dispatched the next day, the <em>Vara</em> and her crew were nowhere to be found. No wreckage or remains were ever located.</p><br/><h1>Origin and Development</h1><br/><p>In the years following this disappearance, rumors spread among haulers and travelers that something malevolent lurked in the Hades system. People began to avoid flying through it on the anniversary of the Vara\u2019s demise because on that day, the ship and her crew would supposedly return from the dead and haunt the system. Stories would vary about what would happen to those who encountered the ship but all of them touched on fears surrounding space travel: sometimes the undead crew would secretly board passing vessels to sabotage vital systems; other stories had them haunt the living until they went insane and vented their own ship; in some, scavengers would happen across an abandoned spacecraft, only for the frozen bodies aboard to come alive at the worst possible moment. Horror stories like these remain a major part of Day of the Vara.</p><br/><p>One of the lighter tales that became popular involved a protagonist who disguised themselves as a <em>Vara</em> crew member, which inspired others to dress as the deceased to protect themselves from bad luck in space travel. Members of Terra\u2019s (Terra III) counterculture picked up on the superstition and threw the first official Day of the Vara event on 27 October 2593. Many attendees dressed as ImperatorIvar Messer I, who had died in 2592, ostensibly to ward off evil. Songs celebrating Messer\u2019s demise that circulated among the crows that night indicated otherwise. Deacon Messer II and the UEE government spun the footage as support for the government and encouraged more Day of the Vara celebrations in 2594, describing it as a way to \"fondly remember those who have been lost.\" The campaign was successful; today, the holiday is primarily seen as a day to dress up as and honor those who have passed. It was officially established as an annual holiday in 2595.</p><br/><h1>Celebration and Traditions</h1><br/><p>In addition to wearing costumes, remembering dead loved ones, and swapping scary stories, revelers practice traditions adapted from various other festivals that celebrate the dead, such as indulging in food and drink like spirit cakes and iced wine, lighting candles, and staying up until the first morning light. Those celebrating on space stations rely on the artificial day/night cycle to signal festivity\u2019s end. Many long-term spacers consider it bad luck to skip the holiday, lest they attract unfavorable attention from the dead. Holos of dead loved ones are often brought out and adorned with green and black ribbons, a reference to colors of the <em>Vara</em> crew\u2019s uniforms. A hauler on a job might set up a holo of a dead celebrity and adjust the colors for lack of better options.

It was discovered in 2855, when three workers assembling Providence Platform for the UEE Navy were startled by a stormwal rising from the depths of the planet's atmosphere, causing them to drop some of their tools. The stormwal is the largest known animal with the ability to fly. </p><br/><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1><br/><p>Some stormwals can reach 100 meters in length upon reaching adulthood. They are most commonly rosy-gray in color, with iridescent red fins and lightly-striped hides flecked with gold. Deep blue stormwals with blue-gray fins have also been observed. They have long, spade-shaped snouts and four eyes, two on each side of the head. Four long barbels trail off the head from the chin and the brow, which are used alongside the filaments on their pectoral, dorsal, and tail fins to sense the miniscule electrical fields of aeroplankton and kiami, their main prey. Four other elongated non-frilled fins are situated on the left and right side of the stormwal's belly. Six nostrils on either side of the snout and two enormous cavities just behind the head take in air that is internally distilled by specialized organs to contain only helium and hydrogen, which is then used to fill inner flight bladders that enable the stormwal to maintain flight. Excess air is expelled, and new air is taken in as needed. </p><br/><h1>BEHAVIOR AND ECOLOGY</h1><br/><p>Adult stormwals must eat between 1000 and 1500 kg of aeroplankton, kiami, small floaters, and other animals each day. They cooperate with their pods when hunting, flying in circles to force prey to concentrate in the center of an air vortex. The stormwals then take turns swimming into the trapped prey, taking huge gulps of air until they are sated. Solo stormwals often eat by diving into cloud formations that are densely-populated with aeroplankton. </p><br/><p>Electricity is vital to a stormwal\u2019s life cycle. To communicate, either to signal that a food source has been found, seek mates, call young who have flown too far from their parents, or simply to engage in bonding behavior, stormwals send electro-magnetic pulses to one another over long distances. When engaging in courtship, each stormwal will weave an intricate electro-magnetic pattern and transmit it to their prospective mate. This process can take several days. If either animal dislikes the pattern, they will break away from one another and seek mates elsewhere. </p><br/><p>Stormwal reproduction is a coordinated affair. Because they give live birth and stormwals do not land, a stormwal in labor must be watched by one or more other stormwals. When the squall emerges from its mother, one of the watching stormwals will catch it and let it rest, so that it has time to slowly fill its internal air cavities. Squalls that are not caught are in great danger of falling to their deaths. When the squall is finally able to float, it is returned to its mother, where it latches onto her mammary gland and feeds. It will nurse as its primary food source for up to two SEY. </p><br/><h1>IN CULTURE</h1><br/><p>Denizens of Orison consider the stormwal a symbol of their city. A large statue of a stormwal entitled \"Until Then\" by artist Biphasha Zhu sits in Cloudview Center, and the official mascot of the city, Finley the stormwal, can be purchased in plush form in local shops. Visitors to Orison can book tours to the nearby Stormwal Sanctuary, where they try to catch a glimpse of the animals in their natural habitat. </p><br/><p>In recent years, poachers have been spotted hunting and killing stormwals within the bounds of the Sanctuary, to the outrage of locals. Crusader Security has increased its presence in the area as a deterrent to further attacks.

It's also important to note that some people, or some disciplines, won't be needed all the way to the end for Squadron - they're working now but they'll roll off, so before Squadron gets officially released, they'll be able to roll over to the PU. So as they get further along they'll constantly evaluate where they are, look at the resources, see the status of everything, and most likely update the Roadmap accordingly as to whether that increases their progress on what they can provide for the PU, while the rest of the team readies themselves to jump onto Chapter 2.", "published_at": "2019-09-06", "title": "Star Citizen Live: All About Development", "source": "https://youtu.be/wENuiIcPK10", "transcript": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/d1e27o/a_summary_of_star_citizen_live_all_about/", "type": "youtube", "time": "54m22s", "published_at_timestamp": 1567797154}, {"objectID": "947639280", "title": "Calling All Devs - Mr. Steal Yo Data", "question": "Is stealing data just intercepting transitions or can info runners also hack a ship data core remotely?", "published_at": "2018-09-24", "source": "https://youtu.be/op7tLkJaTN4", "type": "youtube", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "time": "4m48s", "answer": "", "published_at_timestamp": 1537819156}, {"objectID": "17089ac4f0426f_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The medical bays can't be removed, so the maximum cargo capacity will still be 28 SCU.", "published_at": "2018-08-08", "published_at_timestamp": 1533679200, "question": "Does removing the medical modules increase the amount of SCU that can be used for cargo?", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/16705-Q-A-RSI-Apollo", "title": "Q&A: RSI Apollo", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "947638470", "title": "Calling All Devs - Parties, Scans & Cargo", "question": "What distance will players be able to detect distant contacts?

Which will probably be the hardest nut to crack, except the new item system.", "answer": "Sean Tracy: Are you serious?Forrest Stephan: Except the new item system.ST:  He put that in there, the guy new, the guy new, he's like they're gonna answer item port system.FS: Of course it's the new item system.ST: So I wonder is the guy's name Drew or Drug? Or Droogah?FS: Druh, Drew, Druff.ST: Druff.FS: I don't know, I can barely read.ST: Awful. Okay so which feature beyond Item Port because the Item Port one is really tricky and yeah I'm trying to answer with the Item port.FS: Well I'm just gonna go ahead and do it. It's the Item Port system and we can go into other things, but I'm gonna talk about it anyways because it is the biggest headache so far because we're working on it all the time and you're working on it constantly.ST: Mhm.FS: So the biggest thing that we're dealing with right is all the characters for example are going through a major transitional phase. They're going from what, CryTek uses CDF's which is a type of XML where you tie all your items together, into a sophisticated item port system.ST: Yup.FS: And you've currently been working with Engineers on building this tool and so now we're going to be able to build characters as items with this new item port system which is super helpful, but at the same time it's difficult because you're trying to support everything that's previously existed because you don't want to break everything for design.ST: Exactly.FS: Cinematics, but yet you want to push forward and use the new tech so like it's difficult to support both, but you do have to make the transition.ST: Yeah, it's one of those infamous problems where you've done everything right when you have exactly what you started with.FS: Right.ST: Which seems to make no sense. So visually right and Forrest hits the nail on the head with this one. Again the CDF setup was great for Crytek, it's really hard to maintain hundreds of characters with that sort of system. The other thing that didn't work for us on a coding... programming side is every independent piece of the character, actually needs some component code to go with it.FS: And it needs persistence, right?ST: And it needs persistence, exactly. So because of the new item layout we can actually have different code running, different functions running on different pieces of the character itself rather than you being one character as a whole, you're actually a collection of a lot of different gameplay components that are being updated differently than other things. We kind of didn't really answer is question except the new item system.FS: Yeah and..ST: Beyond the new item system, what else hurts us? Like the character one is a hard one.I would honestly say just the full scale because we're' doing the full scale solar systems now and that's something that I really think is gonna end up out to the community sooner rather than later, is the full size solar system itself. I think that's gonna be the hardest nut to crack. We've already got all the support in it, but it's all the extraneous stuff that we haven't thought of yet or haven't even seen. So we've got QA starting to run it through these full scale tests and then not only will we have full scale, but likely at some... I don't know if it's gonna be at the same time, I'd like to see this happen all to together, is we put one of the \"procedural\" planets within there.FS: Right.ST: Now I call it \"Procedural\", it's gonna be the designer controlled planet. So we put one of the planets into the full solar system scale and then we see all the problem that, that brings.FS: Yup.ST:  Right and then we've got to start fixing these..FS: We're combining these fulls systems or full solar systems with procedural planets,ST: Exactly.FS: With the player customization and the backend.ST: Yup.FS: The persistence so your character is your character going forward and all these things come together which are all 100% necessary for  this project.ST: But how awesome will that be because that is the last piece.FS: But how great is it gonna be because that's really.. We've done so much of the development for art and the content and figuring this stuff out.ST: Sure we're always doing a smaller scale version right, smaller scale and this is finally everything.FS: And this is what brings it together right? It takes all these things we've been working on these past couple years and finally puts these final pieces together.ST: Exactly. So it's Large world, item port, planets working.FS: It's super exciting, but like anything we know it won't be easy, it will be a headache and it will be difficult, but we will achieve it and it will be conquered and it will be awesome, but you know there will be problems.ST: But yeah you guys will see this sooner rather than later.FS: Oh for sure yeah.ST: Because we're doing the testing now.FS: We're doing the testing now,  Awesome. Any chance.. How did they know about that new item system, I wanna ask, I'm gonna ask you first.ST: I bet you Chris talks about it all the time.FS: You think this is one of our internal employees asking this question just to mess with us?ST: Oh you think so?FS: Maybe?

Why would we stop doing that?EKD: Right? Exactly and I don't really know the goal of the restructure it's definitely not to take away from that it's actually to just keep enhancing that.FS: It's to concentrate the disciplines.

But yes, definitely, we've been working on a back story to all the races, not sure if you'll discover a lot of it in SQ42, but you'll definitely be able to learn much more in the PU. As we know already the Vanduul are sort of a nomadic, warrior race, but that's not necessarily how they started or where they came from, but you'll find out more about that as the game and the PU unfolds.", "published_at": "2014-10-27", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 43 (2014.10.27)", "source": "https://youtu.be/phk-0zch1NI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "The Tick", "published_at_timestamp": 1414447201}, {"objectID": "373678680", "question": "Will there be a ship training school so new players can learn tips on how to fly? This may show them some aspects they may not have known about before.", "answer": "Well so, okay, the intention in the final game is that SQ42 is your training experience, which is designed to have a cool story, but there are definitely areas that are a bit like training or tutorials, introducing different flight techniques, or management of ship systems. Once you've gone through SQ42 you'll have a good background in it all. Of course there are some people that don't want to worry about the story etc, so might just jump into Arena Commander for practise, and on the website we'll have some tutorials/lessons/reading so you can have a look at, for example, advanced space manoeuvring 1, where it'll show more sophisticated techniques and so on. So yes the game will be friendly to new people, especially for those that don't play space or flight sims already. It's actually one of the best things about developing and releasing the game like we are, there is just so much feedback and so many suggestions for how to make the game as fun as possible for release. Right now we're working on targeting, especially for joysticks and gamepads. That'll all be in 13.2, which I'm pretty sure will make a lot of you happy, I used to be terrible with a gamepad and now I'm pretty good so a lot of you will be far better!", "published_at": "2014-09-29", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 39 (2014.09.29)", "source": "https://youtu.be/7mTLWkxEEeo", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "CDFWolf", "published_at_timestamp": 1412028036}, {"objectID": "373679120", "question": "As there are coming more and more ships what is right now your favorite ship and what will in your opinion the most interesting thing you will be doing with the community? Could you give us some info with your own words?", "answer": "Well, there are more and more ships... It's kinda hard to say what my favorite is, and one of the ones that I'm really looking forward to, which we're working on right now, is getting the multi-crew stuff working. So we're sort of doing the early stuff on that. So for that the Constellation has kind of been my favorite, but there's some pretty awesome stuff. I mean I love the M50 which we just brought into the hangar a week or so ago, and there's some stuff coming down the pipe that I think you're all like. The Origin 890 Jump is, err, I'm not sure I want to be flying that around in combat, but I certainly would like to be cruising in style. And there's a couple of other ones that we haven't shown yet, that are sort of more role and specialty-based that I think are also going to be pretty awesome. So they're all kinda fun.\"What will in your in your opinion the most interesting thing you will be doing with the community?\" ... I'm not sure if this is about ships, or about what I'LL be doing with the community, but in general the things that I think are fun are, you know, interacting with the community. So the opportunity go and hang out with everyone at Gamescom at the big 2000-full event and all the rest of the stuff - that's all great. We've got PAX Australia coming up a little later this year... so those are all kinda the fun things, and it's kinda fun to share and reveal stuff as we work on it, and get people excited by them.", "published_at": "2014-08-18", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 34 (2014.08.18)", "source": "https://youtu.be/y4wAP1fWe8c", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "G.C.G.B Nash", "published_at_timestamp": 1408399954}, {"objectID": "373685600", "question": "You still have the complete OoB for the Battle of Austerlitz in \"glorious 15 mm hand painted miniatures.\" How many men per figure? How many figures per regiment? ... And did you paint them all yourself?", "answer": "Not really a Star Citizen question, but... Obviously I can't put the entire order of battle, but yes these are some of the miniatures. The rule set that I was having them built to was Empire 3. It has been so long since I actually played these 'cause I essentially started putting this together after my ill-gotten gains on my first Wing Commander which was 24 years ago, and whenever you're making games, you don't get to do as much game playing as you want to do. But yeah, I had a whole, in my old Austin house I had a whole room built up for battle with a whole bunch of geo-hex and all the rest of the stuff. Of course I was also making games so I didn't have as much time to paint everything. So most of this was actually painted in the UK and then shipped over to the US. Although some of it was painted by me.Here is the small Hussar regiment. They're a light cavalry French regiment. That was all done by me which I think I enjoyed a long time ago, but it's also pretty painstaking. But yeah, so it sort of sits there and one day I will hopefully play the battle again. But I haven't managed to do it for at least 20 years.

In turn, if shields do go down, can we forward power back to the weapons systems on the fly?", "answer": "So yes, the answer is absolutely yes on that. That's part of the core design so that you're able to do a huge amount of energy management. You know diverting energy from powerplant to your engine thrusters, to your shields, to your weapons, and even inside you shields, depending on the shield set up you have. You'll probably be able to divert power between the different segments of the shield as well and even between the different weapons.
