A governmental body called the Protectorate or the Protectorate Council, made up of hundreds of individual Banu, maintains connections between Banu systems and manages high-level administrative tasks. Essosouli from across Banu space can be called to convene in the Bacchus system and join the Protectorate in debating issues that affect the Banu as a whole in an event known as the Gathering(eTsey\u00e6 Y\u00e6). The BP maintains friendly trade relations with most known spacefaring civilizations. </p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>Because Banu do not keep historical records, it is unclear when in their history they formed the Protectorate. The earliest known iteration of the BP was encountered in MXY III.364 (SEY 1924) in the Trise system, upon Banu-Xi'an First Contact. At that time, the Banu had already settled in multiple planetary systems, and were utilizing the Protectorate Council and the Gathering as a method of large-scale management. The BP has continued to operate in the same manner since that time. Given the current consensus among xeno-anthropologists that the Banu people are originally from the ocean world Bacchus II, it is speculated that the earliest form of the BP emerged based on alliances between the small island-nations that make up the majority of land on the planet. </p><br/><h1>GOVERNMENT</h1><br/><p>Each planet-state and city-state within the BP is governed by one or more political and bureaucratic Soulis that plan the tasks needed to keep their locales operating smoothly, and then execute them by forming contracts with Soulis that perform said tasks. These include energy production and distribution, water service, sewage processing, road maintenance, garbage collection, and many others. Compensated for their work via a complex system involving bartering combined with monetary payment, these Soulis hold a great deal of power, and are known to withdraw their services if they encounter unfavorable conditions. Conversely, if they gain a reputation for operating in bad faith, they may face retaliation from other Soulis. Although there are some truly independent groups of Banu that operate in their own unique manners, this method of governance is the most common one used in the BP.</p><br/><p>Similar to the Soulis that operate planet-states, the Protectorate Council takes care of the tasks necessary to keep Banu society functional from the top down. These include the distribution of shared currency, the management of inter-civilization trade, the negotiation of treaties, and other ministerial activity. Banu who want a seat on the Protectorate must purchase it directly from their predecessors. In some cases they are handpicked for purchase of the seat, usually from among the non-Protectorate affiliated Essosouli who attend the Gathering. The most successful members of the Protectorate are those who know how to balance the pursuit of their own agenda with the necessity of working with others to achieve a common goal. </p><br/><p>The Gathering is the most important political event in the BP. Generally held on an as-needed basis, it tends to occur two or three times per Standard Earth Year, although sometimes multiple years can pass between meetings. Issues that will affect the entirety of the BP are presented and debated at Gatherings, such as the valuation of their shared currency, the renegotiation of trade agreements, the reassessment of laws and customs, the state of the BP's borders, and others.

The only difference is that all entities in those shards will still be persistent. This allows us to deal with the worst-case scenario by having a really large number of persistent shards and very large replicants to test the mechanics of creating/seeding, simulation with active players, and spin down for recycling or destruction. We want shard creation and destruction in this first phase to be optimal, fast, and cost-neutral.<br/><br/>This approach has several advantages, as we can get to test shard persistence earlier and, more importantly, can measure active metrics across many shards.<br/><br/>For example (non-exhaustive!):<br/><ul>    <li>How many entities remain in a persistent shard over time (shard growth rate)</li>    <li>Size of the global graph (global growth rate)</li>    <li>How many players a single shard database can handle (player usage)</li>    <li>Effect of several gameplay mechanics on entity updates to the shard database (gameplay effects)</li>    <li>Performance profile of the write queues, mean query times of shard db clusters (shard database metrics)</li>    <li>Performance profile of the write queues, mean query times of global db cluster (global database metrics)</li>    <li>Efficiency of database sharding (another sharding level!) of the graph</li></ul><br/>While we do have proper estimates and internal measurements for these, nothing replaces real players generating representative load on the system.<br/><br/>As we get the other components of meshing into play, mainly the static mesh, we plan to gradually reduce the number of shards, grouping players into bigger and bigger shards until we feel comfortable with the performance of replicants, DGSs, and the entity graph.

Previously (or currently?) this would require having a binary file for each manufacturer, which would be a pain to maintain, but the new UI tech (as mentioned previously) will allow for only one file so that only one change would need to be made to affect everything across the board. Zane explains further that the style sheet system is kind of like having a white box outline which can then have a visual description defined and applied to it, and changing between the different styles is simple because they can just use a drop-down menu to switch between manufacturers, and then see the visual description change between them. Simon adds that once the system is in place it gives them more opportunities to hand it over to the graphic designers who can create really nice designs which would then be a lot easier to just drop into the game, as opposed to being dependent on someone going into Flash and knowing how to code within Flash. Zane adds that with these style rules there are a lot of possibilities to differentiate between manufacturers, but also there are ways to do this through changing the layout, such as Origin and MISC having more holographic UIs. They're also investigating the initial engineering requirement to make it so that they can have 3D UIs as well, which would make holographic UIs look even more holographic.

This worked great for ships and mine-ables, but not for other things like signs and cups. So the Scan backend is currently being changed to hold technically arbitrary info, which will allow for the storage of any info on mine-able rocks, info to help Players get the optimal level to mine, info on all of the contents inside a rock, info on passengers, their faction, their health, info on cargo, and what type of cargo, such as illicit or stolen cargo. They're broadening how they can store the info, and what info can be stored, into a data model that they could technically store and put on anything. With that data model, they could put it on an arbitrary item, and design could attach arbitrary info to that item, which could lead into \"random data mission access\" stuff, such as a mission that requires you to go to a specific location, or acquire someone's stolen cargo - essentially anything could be stored in that arbitrary info box. They could hook up the Mission System to install and be able to read this stuff, so that then the Mission Devs could act on this info that's now available, to create a mission that might say, \"steal this cargo, and then sneak into this area to avoid scans by authorities.\" So the entire Scanning System data structure has changed to allow this bigger and broader gameplay that they want. Regarding Exploration, if you come across a data item/device, that device could be scanned, info could be recovered from it and displayed to the Player, and that info could be relevant to a mission, or perhaps it's a note that another Player kept on them which details the location of where they've stored valuable resources and what the security combination is to access them. This will open up doors for design to make interesting missions, and will hopefully also enable the Devs to provide tools for Players to put info into scan data themselves to make interesting mechanics and gameplay. (I understand this to mean: imagine if a Player could own a tablet, such as the one featured in the Squadron 42 Vertical Slice that Trejo had before she was captured, and on that tablet the Player could store some info which could be valuable to other Players one way or another).", "published_at_timestamp": 1558137330}, {"objectID": "947639180", "title": "Calling All Devs - A Wilmslow Odyssey", "question": "How are you going to make earth work and look correct with planets at a quarter scale?", "source": "https://youtu.be/4lBmNXMxW-4", "type": "youtube", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "time": "2m14s", "answer": "", "published_at_timestamp": 1536606175}, {"objectID": "947638370", "title": "Calling All Devs - Everything Flight Control and More", "question": "What is weapons system 2.0?", "source": "https://youtu.be/2cAzagggfHA", "type": "youtube", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "time": "1m36s", "answer": "", "published_at_timestamp": 1525719425}, {"objectID": "5ade51e43ea09_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "On the other side of the cabin, you'll be able to find room for 2 SCU as well as easy access to most ship components (some less important won't be accessible without removing the SCU first).", "published_at_timestamp": 1524607200, "question": "What's inside?

Also if you\u2019re on a multicrew ship and there\u2019s other actual players on the ship, even if you logout or disconnect, the ship will still persist with the other players on it, as long as there are actual acting real live players on it.

Whether we go into natural disasters more like on the planetary scale, it\u2019s a bit more complicated. We would like to do earthquakes and all kind of random events, but like meteor showers and stuff like this. There is room for that, we\u2019re looking into it, but when it comes to you mentioned volcanic eruptions or floods, those are a bit harder to do. I mean, we would love to do them, but there\u2019s so much tech involved in having water physics wash everything or lava start flowing through the, in most games where we see lava it\u2019s very, it\u2019s either simplistic like in, I don\u2019t know, minecraft type of game, it\u2019s nice, gameplay wise, but it\u2019s not looking to the standards of where we want Star Citizen to be.

We look at the scale of what their doing and we upscale it or downscale it based on the project needs.If situations like technical blockers pop up something we've mentioned in previous Ten for The Producers videos is every time we put together a schedule and publish it for the team it soon becomes obsolete because dates and how long someone takes on a take can change from day to day we may need a programmer on a task pulled off because we've got another blocker that needs a fix and that may even become related to what he's working on. Because we are a I wouldn't say a small office but we have a  limited number of resources that makes each time how a developer spends on a particular project that much more valuable. So being able to plot out that time is a very tricky thing to do.Eric Kieron Davis: It is and how do you plan for that? It always comes down we've never done it before the teams never done it before we've talked about this before at the end of it just add five ten percent buffer they will take 2 weeks so we give them a little bit over two and a half weeks and say that's our coverage. So you'll tend to see production bloat things a little bit more but that's usually to protect the team. You want to over deliver as opposed to the other way around where people over promise. Anything that's part of our job as production is to go we're going to add a little bit extra time because even if comes down we deliver faster and then we'll know for the next time as well.DV: On top of that let's say that I ask Mark Abent to do a programming task and he gives me an estimate that it takes fives days. Is that five days from now or five days worth of work? That's something we have to be concerned with as well what resources does he have at his disposal as well?EKD: And being a live plus development pre-production plus production and you also have to add in a certain amount of bugs.

Can you speak to the intentions of how robust it will be in regards to a player's ethnicity, hair styles, colors and physique?", "answer": "So, the character creator is something that is fairly high priority for us but it won't be around for awhile because we have to resolve some issues with how we do the character heads. We have these very, very, very fancy heads, you can see a little bit of them in the game now but we'll be showing some sort of next step up stuff at CitizenCon.The concept is we've already sort of taken a bunch of scans of different people, male and female, of different ethnicities and the concept is you'll be able to morph or blend between different face types, to create the face that you want when we're ready to do that. There's some behind the scenes technical stuff that we have to do, we have to move from pre-baked animation conversation stuff to sort of run time interpolation stuff which we are working on. We have an incredibly talented animation Senior Engineer called ?Ivo Herzog? who is in our German office and he actually is the guy who wrote CryAnimation in the first place. So, that's actually his next task right after he finishes the ragdoll zero-g stuff we're working on right now. Once we get that running we'll be able to blend between the heads.So, the initial stage for customizing your character will probably just let you pick one of, I think we have right now 8 male, 8 female heads. You'll be able to pick one of these heads types. We're working to put a process in place for clothes and stuff like that so you can sort of decide what clothes you're going to wear. Right now, of course, all you can do in social module is you can be just one of the 6 characters that will be with the FPS. Light, medium, heavy marine. Light, medium, heavy outlaw.Longer term we want you to dress up in the clothes, the outfits you want to so we're just finishing off our character pipeline in terms of some of the new tech we're getting in place. The shader tech I was talking about, the process and then we're going to just try to ramp it up to generate a bunch of clothes, doing our last tweaks on our base male, base female meshes. Then hopefully we'll have a whole pipeline for clothes. This is not with this social and will probably be a few months before you see that but when we get around to activating the shops, certainly before the end of this year there will hopefully be clothes and stuff you can customize your character in. Not too long after that you will be able to customize the head. We're not sure about body type because if we do too significant of a difference in body type we would need a different skeleton so we have one standard player skeleton which I think you've seen all our updates where we've changed every one of these skeletons, seven times now. For lots of good reasons but it's a massive retarget whenever you change them so the concept is we're going to have one base male skeleton and one base female for players. We will have some specific skeletons for other characters, NPC characters, so like in SQ42, certain characters will not be the standard sizing and then on top of that we can change some level of the appearance so you can have someone who's slightly fatter or slightly thinner but not necessarily changing the general proportions or bone proportions. That's the real issue with the skeleton, if you suddenly start the length of the legs or length of the arms then you have to retarget all of the animations and we have thousands, and thousands and thousands of animations. We don't just have running around FPS combat stuff, we have all these sort of living in the universe animations. Getting in and out of your ship, sitting down at the table, taking a nap in your bunk bed in your ship. All these sort of things... dancing, which people are quite fond of doing right now in social, all those kind of things. So, that's why we can't have players decide now I'm going to have a small character, a medium sized, or tall character, for that skeleton reason. We'll do some height differentiation based on the head because that can give you.... and we'll do some body size differentiation but not general sort of proportion differentiation, that'll be more reserved for NPCs. So, I hope that answers that question. I didn't answer the bit about... ethnicities I did &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; hairstyles, colours and physiques so you will be able to pick different hairstyles and you'll be able to pick different skin colours, etc. Physique was what I was sort of talking about, like body type.

If you look back at what english was 930 years before right now, I'm not sure how many conversations we could really have that would be understood. That's our concern. We need to make a game that can be understood by everybody. Obviously English is the main language of the game, but we also have people who are playing the game who it's their second or third language, so, we need to make sure that, when we are writing stuff, that people will be able to understand it right now, even though we understand the world would be different than it is right now. So, from our perspective, we try to use flavour language when the Lore requires it. Think technology like mobiGlas, ship components, stuff like that, money, it being creds instead of dollars, the dialogue of Cathcart is distinct, and that was a conscious choice on our part, because Cathcart is a lawless system and it has a different history than the UEE, and that was a way for us to be able to distinguish that and be able to add that little flavour, so if you are on a planet somewhere, and able to hear that, it'll give you a hint to their background. And as exciting as it can be, Clockwork Orange, Blade Runner, both used mutated language to give a sense of the future and how it's changed and why it's changed, to do it on that massive level all throughout the game would be extremely difficult, especially since, accessibility issue, and there's also alien races and their dialects that I think take precedence in having to figure out.Cherie Heiberg: We don't want the humans in the game to sound like we're reading Cantebury Tales today.

So yes, it works like a traditional RPG, but with the difference being that everything is visible, perhaps not if you have something in a pocket or backpack, but things strapped on will be.

I took over the ship pipeline in late August, beginning of September, and since then we've added a ship paint which involves a second UV set to all the ships, which was a whole big thing that we had to go back and redo all these damage states. The UK team right now at Foundry 42 is working on adding a new procedural damage system for ships so you basically can eliminate the 25's, maybe 50's, maybe the 75% damage states and handle it all through procedural damage - and that all sounds really promising and cool but that will, again, impact the way that we go about making our ships.So it's a constantly evolving thing, and then on the design side, I mean if you saw the initial Cutlass release there was a lot of-... the Cutlass was done, I think it was put in the hangar... December of 2013 - just in time for Christmas around this time last year. And that ship originally, it's design wasn't fully fleshed out, the variants weren't fully fleshed out. So one of the things we've done is Foundry 42's going through and doing the white box for all these and trying to figure out more of the logistical things, like at the time we didn't have a lot of answers on, \"what is a med bay? How does a med bay work? What is the bounty hunting? How does that work? How do you capture people? How do you reclaim them?\" - Not reclaim them for resources but reclaim them as, like turn them in. Those things weren't answered, the designs weren't in place, and now that we have answers to those questions, yeah we have to come back to the ships and look at them again with a critical eye and go, \"okay, now that we've got what we think is a solid gameplay loop, does the ship actually support that mechanically?\"So yeah, it's a constantly evolving thing, but all game development is like that, right? It's a constantly evolving, iterative process, so that's really I think part of the fun of being in game development is it's always changing, it's always new there's always an openness and a quest for new ideas, and better ways to do things... so yeah, it's part of what's great about the job.DV: Even just as producers our day-to-day stuff is evaluated on a regular basis such as: \"How do we handle certain types of emails? Certain email groups? How do we send our weekly newsletter or even weekly production report?\" So we try to find ways to streamline every single thing we do, so if we find a process that is inefficient or at least could be iteratively improved, we are going to explore it. That's pretty much what we do.TD: Yeah, if you don't like change this would not be the gig for you.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 02 (2014.12.29)", "source": "https://youtu.be/QiR6yJbFCfM", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Skwisgaar", "published_at_timestamp": 1419894093}, {"objectID": "373677770", "question": "Given the ever increasing cargo holds of the newer ships, what do you see the role of the Freelancer being? For example, will be there be jump points that the smaller ship will be able to navigate that will block larger ships?", "answer": "Yes, that's absolutely the case. We're talking about having different classifications of Jump Points, the rips (like in interstellar) will have different classes. I've always viewed these as having different sizes, so there will definitely be ones that only a smaller ship can navigate, and some that capital ships can navigate. Also these might not necessarily always connect to the same system, so there could quite easily be routes that are quicker from A-B that are only suitable for smaller ships. Think of it like a mountain pass, some only allow foot traffic, others might take a car etc etc. There will definitely be uses of this in gameplay, situations where there are advantages to having a smaller ship. Maybe there's someone with a big supertanker that needs to take a more round-about route, but your smaller ship can take the faster route, just like it happens in the real world. There will be ups and downs to various ships. I see threads about how people are worried orgs are going to dominate with something as big as the Javelin. While they're good for team play and definitely have their advantages, they might not be as useful for some other roles, and might be at a huge disadvantage. That's definitely a goal of star citizen as a whole, is to have \"different horses for different courses\", where each ship caters to different roles and all have their advantages over each other. Jump Points are just another example of how we'll ensure that.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 47 (2014.12.01)", "source": "https://youtu.be/E8Euwh_fPeg", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "War Dog", "published_at_timestamp": 1417474885}, {"objectID": "373678210", "question": "With the vast and detailed universe that you are building, what place or thing are you most excited to see in the game?", "answer": "Will Weissbaum: Well right now it's really just anything.

And all the modules are coming together right now, so we're on the cusp of all this content just exploding in - so that's pretty exciting.DH: Yeah... I dunno. I'm gonna go with what most of the people in the \"Ask a Dev\" in the community are looking for - I want to say Tevarin. That's my big thing. I want to see Tevarin.WW: Ooh, the mysterious Tevarin - that's pretty good. Like, exploring the universe, what do I want to see? I think I kinda have a place in my heart that I really wanna go visit Spider. I think that'll be a really cool setting, and if it ends up anywhere near as cool as I have in my head, I think that would be a really awesome location.DH: Yeah.

What mission types are you thinking might be in the game for salvagers?", "answer": "Certainly, I definitely think it's a good resource mining mechanic, so rather than actual resource mining, like going to asteroids or planets and mining seams, this is another way to go and take the remnants of a big space battle for more raw material and resources that goes back into the economy rather than just disappear. So that's definitely a large part of it, the other thing could be stripping functioning weapons off of destroyed ships, so you might find a dead destroyer that has a working gatling gun attached, you might find what parts are still useful, which you'd store in a separate hold and could sell or be repurposed. Those are the kind of typical missions you can expect, but we're also looking at the possibility of salvage type ships being involved in fixing/repairing other ships as well, though we are looking at maybe some specific ships for that task as well. I think salvaging will be a really interesting role to play in the PU, I could definitely see an org going to battle with a big ship at the rear for command and control, plus a salvage ship to go in and recover as much of the material or undamaged weapons etc so as not to leave money on the table so to speak.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 40 (2014.10.06)", "source": "https://youtu.be/pBWJYb2Wtg0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Moose", "published_at_timestamp": 1412632803}, {"objectID": "373679020", "question": "After watching the Connie's commercial, we have been exposed to landing on an unexplored planet which is capable of being terraformed.

You won't be able to decide the fate of pre-existing life - you should've read the small-print at the end of the commercial which said that it's a criminal act to break the Fair Chance Act, which is something that was put in place a few hundred years ago in the UEE to make sure that we, or Earth, or members of the UEE didn't interfere with evolving life forms. But I think there certainly will be the ability to claim something as a discovery.

Will the skins be able to be applied to all ship classes or just the \"Original 5\"? I have all of them as another way to support and would love to have some more details.", "answer": "Yep, so ship skins are still slightly up in the air. Longer-term we have a process and we discussed some tech that we're gonna do to allow you to sort of paint and customize your ships, and obviously that is also the same sort of tech that we'll be using for the ship skins. So if we can get that tech to be flexible and more generic, then it would be actually quite... it would be easier to have the skins be on multiple ships. If it's not and we have to do a custom skin for each individual ship, then in those cases the skin would only really be applicable to the original ones that we said it would be. But we don't know yet, so we're still doing R&D. I mean our goal is to make it as flexible as possible, but that's sort of in our graphics R&D pipeline so we haven't done it yet. So it could kinda go either way right now.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 32 (2014.08.04)", "source": "https://youtu.be/NM0DVz1VcvY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "HeadlessChook", "published_at_timestamp": 1407189612}, {"objectID": "373685500", "question": "When player organizations enter into direct conflict, how will NPC organizations such as the UEE respond? Will there be a need for a declaration of war such that the UEE recognizes the conflict and does not interfere?", "answer": "That is a good question again.I don't really think the organizations necessarily have to declare war against each other because they're essentially private corporations, groups of people, or guilds, and there's always conflicts between them.Now of course depending on what happens or where the battles happen, the UEE may step in. So two organizations can not go toe-to-toe out in the orbital space of Earth. The UEE is going to say \"conflict is not allowed in this safe area,\" whereas you could probably be fighting in the outer edge of the galaxy and that would be fine because there isn't any sort of UEE rule.So I kind of see that organizations fighting each other will mostly be fighting over areas of resources that are on the fringe of the UEE controlled space. And then there will be some clandestine activity happening inside UEE space, but there won't be all out war right in the middle of UEE space because that would be problematic.Just like if you had IBM and Apple had a bunch of mercenaries and started shooting each other in the streets for dominance of the tech industry. Probably the United States of America would frown upon such action.So it will be along those lines, I mean maybe we'll find a way to allow the organizations to bring conflict on a more limited stage into UEE controlled areas, but for me I feel like I would like to see competition via industry and business, and then back-door stealthy kind of stuff where people are going after each other. Then all out warfare is on the edges of the galaxy.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 08 (2014.02.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/wE_xZdeakEw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Kommissar", "published_at_timestamp": 1392677901}, {"objectID": "373685870", "question": "Are asteroids and other space objects built in a modular fashion like the shops? It seems like you could design a few different building blocks for constructing asteroids, and then randomly assemble them in lots of different ways.", "answer": "So that is a good question. We definitely have quite a few different asteroids, but we're actually doing R&D right now into a bunch of procedural generation of asteroids and asteroid fields, so I know there has been a lot of talk about procedural stuff and crafted stuff which Star Citizen is more of a crafted experience, but we certainly are using elements of procedural generation to help us flesh out a lot of the world. So my goal is to make sure that everything feels designed and crafted, but you use elements of procedural generation to give you the variation that you need. So asteroids are a great example of that where we have certain rules for asteroids, but we may procedurally be generating the asteroid field or the asteroids themselves. So we're actually doing some pretty cool and interesting work on that and down the road w will probably be sharing that with you guys.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 06 (2014.01.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/NcRxuvQT3Ew", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Krel", "published_at_timestamp": 1390598024}]
