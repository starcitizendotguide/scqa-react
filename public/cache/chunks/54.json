In SEY 2617, Harar was patrolling the Horus system with his gunner Lieutenant Dyson, when they detected a gravitational anomaly that they determined to be a jump point after hours of analysis. Harar convinced Dyson to navigate it instead of reporting it to headquarters, arguing that this was their chance to earn a place in history. However, when they exited the jump point, they found themselves in a Xi'an-controlled system and were quickly captured. Harar and Dyson were held captive and interrogated by the Xi'an government for three full days. They finally convinced their captors that the rest of the Human military was unaware of the jump point, and were returned to Horus and told to transmit the message that any UEE vessels spotted in Kai'pua would be attacked on sight. Harar was reprimanded for failing to report his discovery to his commander and accepted a demotion. He went on to serve for thirty more years and retired as a Captain in 2647.

A thin crust of water-ice on the moon's surface is said to represent the cool demeanor of Yela, the oldest sibling in the Human children's story A Gift for Baba, after whom the moon was named. Crusader Industries security came under fire during a Senate hearing in SEY 2949 for failing to curtail criminal activity in the outpost colloquially known as Jumptown, located inside one of Yela's craters. </p><br/><h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1><br/><p>Due to its thin oxygen atmosphere and distance from the system's sun, the surface of Yela is very cold, with average temperatures ranging between -55 \u00b0C and -10 \u00b0C. The large water ice sheets that sprawl across the plains and mountains feed the water cycle via sublimation. There are no bodies of liquid water on Yela's surface, nor is there any rainfall, but snow showers, fog, and windstorms can arise when the weather conditions are correct.</p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>Discovered by navjumper Toshi Aaron alongside the rest of the Stanton system in 2851, Yela was briefly the sole property of the United Empire of Earth (UEE). During this time, the UEE Navy began to construct a base in the skies of Stanton II. It lightly mined the moons for resources, but largely left them alone. </p><br/><p>In 2865, driven by a financial crisis, the UEE sold all the planets and moons in the system to various corporations, including Crusader Industries, who purchased the parent planet along with Yela and its sister moons. After refitting the Navy's platforms on the newly-renamed planet Crusader for its own use, the company established multiple mining facilities and security outposts across Yela, Cellin (Stanton 2a), and Daymar (Stanton 2b), and offered some of the land for lease.</p><br/><p>In spite of the inhospitable environment, some Humans have made Yela their home. Wilma Ivery built the first permanent homestead in 2907, where she lived until her death in 2935 from natural causes. In 2909, the first Human was born on Yela when Albert and Nora Triolo were forced to make an emergency landing to give birth to their daughter, Erma Triolo. Outlaw group Nine Tails began using abandoned Navy facilities as bases in 2946, leading to an increase in patrols from Crusader Security.</p><br/><h1>CULTURE</h1><br/><p>Unregulated ground-vehicle racing is a popular pastime among residents of and visitors to Yela. Lakedra Walsh organized and won the first recorded ground-vehicle race on the moon in 2912. The site of this race was made into a permanent racetrack, and was named Lakedra's Lap in her honor. Many of the racing sites take advantage of Yela's terrain, and include large boulders and rocks.

I do think that that's gonna be one of the pieces we wanna do.FS: Yeah, eventually.ST: I think it would be amazing. So the second piece of this question is, do I think that the current procedural tech will be capable of generating the flora and fauna...FS: Right.ST: At the fidelity that we are? Yeah. Absolutely, that's the goal.FS: Yeah. Because the art is still making the assets. So the fidelity will be there, right? It's just a matter of this procedural tech deciding where to populate the plants and the animals. Right?ST: Right.FS: I don't see any reason that we can't have the same visual fidelity that we have for the rest of the game.ST: That's the drive, that's the direction, right?FS: Yeah.ST: All of us have worked on. We've all worked on little levels that have been hand authored so much.FS: Yup.ST: Our goal with this whole system is to be able to make an entire world at that same level of fidelity. We want to have trees that look like Crysis. We want to have...FS: Yup.ST: We want to have animals and things like that within them. Absolutely we want them to be at that exact same fidelity.FS: It's just...ST: And do I think it's possible? Absolutely.FS: I think so too.ST: With most of the stuff that we've seen in the last little while? Absolutely.FS: Just have to be smart about how you author your art. As long as you go for a very technical, practical approach and optimized approach. I think that's really quite possible.ST: No, and that's it. To be honest too, the other thing with it is generating forests, trees, even animals and things like that. Getting them all placed on the planet is difficult yes, but there's harder types of planets to do.FS: Yeah.ST: One of the more difficult, and you've worked on things around this, is like procedural city-type planet. What then do we do and how do we keep it at that fidelity for a planet that's covered in an entire city?FS: Yeah.ST: That's a lot trickier, I think anyway.FS: Yeah. Well, you know, it's just a matter of you just making everything as modular as possible and then who knows what you could do ...ST: Exactly.FS: With the right game play code.ST: I hope that answered the question. I know we're being a bit obtuse, but it's only because we want to be able to show you.FS: Well, we haven't gone into a lot of things... yeah, yeah.ST: Yeah.

That will be more us on the PU, whatever you want to call it, sort of \"game master\" side, where we'll look at what's happening around in the universe and then we'll create occasional pockets of chaos - maybe there's a famine over here, maybe there's a bit of civil war breaks out over here - that will create events and missions for the players and the AI to participate in.So we'll look at it and there will be places where people may have to give aid, or come into fight off a Vanduul incursion or all sorts of stuff, and potentially space stations or who knows, a planet, could even get raised. But that would all be, I guess overall manipulation of the full PU to riff off what all the players are doing out there, kind of what the AI is doing in it's sort of systemic way, and then we sort of - like throwing a pebble into a smooth pond - put a few pebbles here and there to create ripple effects to create a little interest.

I would love to hone my skills and test weapons on ships after other than Vanduul, and I would love to see the larger ships in solo play.", "answer": "So, Pirate Swarm essentially is what we got in Crusader.  So, we were sort of building . . at the time when it was just Arena Commander, we want to change it around and have maybe some other modes to fight some other enemies.  In reality the Crusader map, which is the mini PU map, which is really going to grow into the Stanton star system map, where we sort of decided to put these different encounters whether it was with AI or you could find other players to fight.  And so that's essentially where Pirate Swarm went.So, in the short term we are not really planning on doing a lot of work on Arena Commander, because we really want to get the base game play and functionality into the proper large world map, the proper mini PU.  Get the various rock, paper, scissors aspects, the various different professions, the various different forces in opposition, and the various mechanics that keep people aligned whether you're good or bad or whatever.  For us Arena Commander, now is a good place to test some of your dogfighting skills.Longer term we will add to it.We will probably add some more challenge modes and definitely do better matchmaking and make that more of a competitive practice area.  Of course we'll do the same thing with Star Marine, but right now we really just sort of want to get everything into the mini PU because that's sort of our foundation for the overall game.  Then things will trickle later on into features for Arena Commander or Star Marine, which are really meant to be ultimately training modes for you to train in certain aspects of the game.  Potentially also to test your skills against other players without having the same sort of risk you would have in the proper Persistent Universe because it's persistent.

As far as changing out your armor, that's something that I believe will require you to visit a vendor. You will be able to go to a planet or to a spaceport and say \"hey change out my armor\" but I don't believe it's something you will be able to do through any of the repair functions. It's a lot more involved with your direct ship structural integrity than the repair stuff is more about layering over the...  your hull is technically just armor, it serves no other purpose but as far as field repair is concerned you will not be able to fabricate high density armor vs ablative armor or stealth armor or anything like that.

The changing and narrowing tunnels requiring constant re-correction to navigate them safely. Similarly, the absolute extreme of this is Niobe's complete control of the logos in the Matrix Revolutions whilst escaping sentinels. Are we likely to experience environments like this within the PU (or missions in Squadron 42) that will equally challenge your piloting skill and the true maneuverability of your ship?", "answer": "I would say yes, definitely. I think we've mentioned before but jump points in some ways are going to be quite similar to this, not necessarily going through a death star but they are tunnels that collapse, undulate and move around and narrow and the more risky, the more unstable ones are worse that way but sometimes the risky, more unstable ones are the best shortcut to get to a location.What our plan is that navigating a jump point potentially if it's not a safe one could require some extreme piloting skills along the lines of what was described here. Then I'm pretty sure we'll have some other areas where whether it's flying inside a big structure in space or even down planetside, we'll put some challenges in there that are pretty cool. Possibilities are endless with the structure in the game we're building, it's one of the reasons it's taking so long but we are engineering it to do some pretty amazing things so I think you'll all appreciate that.

Any progress or plans on this topic?", "answer": "Well, there is some enhanced CryEngine support, and one of the key people who was working on that at Crytek is now part of our team in Frankfurt. We're just sort of waiting to integrate 3.7, and then we'll integrate 3.8, which are the two most recent releases on the CryEngine side. It's always very complicated with us because we've modified the engine so much, it's not as simple as just getting it and putting it in in a day, it takes a long time to integrate them properly, but those integrations are holding off for us to finish the Star Marine work, and the stuff that we're doing for GamesCom. We're planning on doing the integration after GamesCom, and then it would be in one of the patches that would be in the Development branch, that would then go to release branch. I think you can look forward to using, or seeing some of the results of the 3.7 integration into our code base, probably towards the end of August or beginning of September, I would guess. But yes, we'll definitely take all of the updates they have for virtual reality in CryEngine and put it in. We still want to do some specific custom stuff on our side, and that's really a matter of engineering time on our side, and that's a matter of stuff settling. There's some pretty cool new stuff like the Valve headset as well, so that was on our longer-term roadmap, but right now we're focused on getting the large world and the zone system and Arena Commander 2.0 working, which is multi-crew, and then after that's where we get back on to focusing on some other stuff, and Virtual Reality will be one of them.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 61 (2015.07.27)", "source": "https://youtu.be/f8DX2VEeREY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Admiral Schemen", "published_at_timestamp": 1438036231}, {"objectID": "373682300", "question": "Dear Producers, We have seen the process of fixing bugs on bug smashers. \"Awesome programer sits down, thinks, and magic code fixes fly out of his fingers\" Is the process of implementing a new feature similar? A lot of people seem to think so. Could you walk us through beginning to end, the process of taking a feature, from an idea out of Chris Roberts' head (or someone elses) all the way to being played on our computers, including some obstacles you run into and how you over come them? Of particular instance to me are localized ship physics-instances, GOST, or grabby hands!", "answer": "Travis Day: So lets take uh, of this, I think the best would be... GOST. GOST is a really good example and we're going through it right now. So to step through that process, is the process similar to implementing a feature as fixing a bug. No, fixing a bug is part of implementing a feature. There's a whole stage for that at the end. The reality is every feature is a package of bugs that you haven't created yet. So with every feature you have to build in a bunch of QA and bug fixing time at the end, because it will happen. Even the best engineers on the planet, it's not even that they're making mistakes, it's just things evolve over time or this thing over here impacted them in a way that wasn't forseeable.So with the example of GOST though for example, we have a need in the game or a need gets identified. And that's really when you're talking about a new feature it's either a need or a new idea. In the example of GOST it was a need. We have the need to be able to understand where the player is versus where the ship is and what their respective states are so that we can have them interact in appropriate ways. Like not being able to get into a turret when somebody else is already in that turret or being aware that the ladder is down thusly you should climb the ladder rather than playing the deploy ladder animation. Or detecting the player to turn on lights.Anyways, tons of examples I could give you. But these were a list of needs, that were identified by Chris, by the designers. And so what basically happens is they go in, they write up a list of, \"Hey here are all the needs, here are the problems that we have that we need to solve in order to accomplish these things.\" And now generally this would be described as your GDD, your game design document, or your level design document or in this case a feature design document. These are the thing that we have that are a list of problems and then you take those and you hand those over to the engineering team. And they'll tell you, \"Okay, we think the best way to fix this would be...\" And then they document their technical design document. And they all peer review it and then they sit back down with the designers. They hold the two together and they kinda say, \"Okay is this really, is this the best solution for solving all of these problems in one holistic way.\" Then it comes to the, \"Okay! Greenlit, everybody is happy. This is exactly what we want to do, this is how we want to do it, everybody is onboard.\" We have the strike team formed. Then we literally sit down and break it down from beginning to end, and some of these things take 6 months, even longer. Then you say, \"Okay well here's where we're going to start. Here's the easiest, simplest, and then build, build, build. And you usually start with the framework, the foundation, and then build and add features on top of that. And then at the end or, throughout the process, but then at the end you'll have a long kind of buffer time, for QA, testing, bug fixing, integration into whatever the relevant stream that you're supposed to be in. So for example this feature might be built on that double pyramid down in Game Dev -> Arena Commander -> subset feature branch of GOST. And then it's getting constant integrations with Arena Commander and then eventually it needs to get integrated into that, integrated into main. So you have to put in maybe a weeks time, to solve any issues.So that's really the, the super basic and I could talk about it forever but I've probably gone too long already. The super basic process of taking a feature from an idea, to getting it all the way down into the game.Eric Kieron Davis: Yeah, great question.

The PU team is working a lot at creating a huge mix of environments, spaces, that reflect various cultures.  The distance between the culture and the widely populated system so, for example, if you're from Earth, everything around Earth will be built up and bustling, the further you get from Earth you'll start feeling a little more rough and tumble, the further you are from Earth's influence you're much more on that edge.  Names of the NPC's right now that we're working with are, as boring as they are by name, 'Frontier', and it is, the types of frontier.  Are you an outlaw, a pirate type person.  A good description of Frontier could be Luke's home planet.  Serenity could be Frontier.  But it's the opposite of Star Trek, which is close-knit, the home planet which looks nice and shiny.  Graffiti is really interesting.  It's something we talked abou with one of the teams, that you wouldn't expect traditional graffiti, at least on a space station.  SO the question becomes, if everyone has these digital components, this digital stuff, where do they get the spray paint?  And then what kid is running around tagging on a space station?  So we do have a case with the Nyx space station, which is a derelict asteroid space station that's been run down, it's got a feel of Akira, the question comes back to the environment, it's where do they get the spray paint.  SO how we go forward is we have a digital spray paint, it's something we haven't really explored yet, so.

Or will that be released in the later game stages?Chris Roberts, you the man!", "answer": "All right, thank you very much for that. No, the Planet Side Module is essentially, we'll be opening up a bunch of the interactions that would happen down on the planet to everyone in the community to play with.The idea is, when you're in your hangar, there's a door in all the hangars to the outside world, you can go through that door, you would step out, and you would be in a planet side environment. We may debut with just one, or we may debut with a couple, and you can wander around in the environment, there would be shops where you could buy stuff. You could go to a bar where you could talk to people and ultimately in the game that's where you would look for missions or meet other players in the bar.The idea of the Planet Side Module is to test out and work on the functionality of all that which would happen once you land from space. So you will definitely have the ability to wander around and have some in depth interactions and do all that. Then as we go along, we would be adding more functionality and action to it, and then as the Persistent Universe is rolling out, there will be more areas to explore.The planet side stuff is one of our biggest tasks because there's a lot of them. We've got something like 450 different landing locations right now that we're talking about, and then you've got to build all the environments and the contents. So we're really working pretty hard on how to do that in a way that matches up to our quality of fidelity, but won't take 400 years to build.I think we've got a pretty good solution that uses a combination of unique stuff, some more modular stuff, and we are longer term researching some kind of procedural stuff to help build out and flesh out some environments based on criteria the economy system feeds in. And the Planet Side Module will all be testing grounds for that.

Its not a perfect process but I think it will be the bets one for the long run - and as a lot of people have noted just a sub set of some the proposed functionality will be pretty awesome and I'm not going to stop until we get it all (that makes sense from a fun / payable / balancing standpoint)", "user": "Zenshai", "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12grru/i_am_chris_roberts_creator_of_wing_commander/c6v0tmk/", "published_at_timestamp": 1351771200, "title": "r/IAmA: Chris Roberts", "type": "reddit"}, {"objectID": "128e3337563f41_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "We've all seen the amazing things Cryengine has allowed you to do graphically, but what engine related limitations have you run in to, and how have/will you mitigate these issues?", "answer": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12grru/i_am_chris_roberts_creator_of_wing_commander/c6uwk4r/", "user": "egg651", "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12grru/i_am_chris_roberts_creator_of_wing_commander/c6uwk4r/", "published_at_timestamp": 1351771200, "title": "r/IAmA: Chris Roberts", "type": "reddit"}]
