Like, do you want to commit to the empire or do you not really care about the empire but you still want to live in it?BL: As you attach it to game play, you need that lower spectrum too. People who decide to be civilians, or criminals, need to have a viable game play experience too. It has to be a choice, rather than a ladder you climb.DH: Right. Right. Also, you know, not so obviously better quality of life or something like that where it's like, \"Only Citizens can have a job\" or something like that. Yeah, as far as the specific game play stuff, I think we're still sort of trying to hone in on that.BL: I'm just imagining it's literally the same as a Senior Citizens discount. Citizens get a 1.50 USD off their egg plate!DH: You get an awesome pen.

There's actually two questions within here. Right?Forrest Stephan: Yeah. Yeah.ST: So the first one that I want to deal with is, \"Will planets have variant biomes?\" Of course! We have to. Otherwise you're gonna end up with planets that all looked rocky.FS: Yeah.ST: Planets that all looked frozen. Planets that all look...and we've got some of the best atmosphere technology that I've ever seen.FS: Oh it's incredible.ST: It's absolutely phenomenal.FS: Yeah.ST: We've got... I don't know how much we're talking about this yet, but we've solved all kinds of lighting challenges, let's say. Thing like GI on the planets. There's some good solutions already in place. I don't see any reason why we wouldn't have variant biomes. Now if he's talking about variant biomes within the planet itself. You've got a planet, up north is going to be the polar icecap...FS: Yeah, yeah, and down...ST: On the south is gonna be polar icecaps. In the middle, does it get warmer and stuff like this?FS: Yup. Desert or something, who knows.ST: Absolutely! There's no reason we can't do this. Weather regions is a bit of a different story. That's a lot harder, because sure we can do all levels of code. We know where you are on the planet, we know what sector you're in, what's around you. But how do we communicate that over to the player?FS: And how deep do you go with the design? Do you have it where, when you go to that location that it's always raining?ST: Exactly! Or is there a hurricane?FS: Or do you do it where there's actually some kind of weather happen? I think there's a lot of...ST: Right, right.FS: Things to solve with the weather.ST: To give you guys an idea, these are the things that we're thinking about. The fidelity of our planets are gonna be such that you've not seen this before. There's no question.FS: Right. Oh absolutely. I've seen it, it's awesome.ST: Now whether you have moving weather and things like that on it? That's a problem that we're not yet ready to solve. They're already taking a look at it, things like volumetric clouds and all this kind of stuff, to have moving weather patterns and things like that within the planet?FS: Yeah.ST: That will be something for another time, I think. I do think that that's gonna be one of the pieces we wanna do.FS: Yeah, eventually.ST: I think it would be amazing. So the second piece of this question is, do I think that the current procedural tech will be capable of generating the flora and fauna...FS: Right.ST: At the fidelity that we are? Yeah. Absolutely, that's the goal.FS: Yeah. Because the art is still making the assets. So the fidelity will be there, right? It's just a matter of this procedural tech deciding where to populate the plants and the animals. Right?ST: Right.FS: I don't see any reason that we can't have the same visual fidelity that we have for the rest of the game.ST: That's the drive, that's the direction, right?FS: Yeah.ST: All of us have worked on. We've all worked on little levels that have been hand authored so much.FS: Yup.ST: Our goal with this whole system is to be able to make an entire world at that same level of fidelity. We want to have trees that look like Crysis. We want to have...FS: Yup.ST: We want to have animals and things like that within them. Absolutely we want them to be at that exact same fidelity.FS: It's just...ST: And do I think it's possible? Absolutely.FS: I think so too.ST: With most of the stuff that we've seen in the last little while? Absolutely.FS: Just have to be smart about how you author your art. As long as you go for a very technical, practical approach and optimized approach. I think that's really quite possible.ST: No, and that's it. To be honest too, the other thing with it is generating forests, trees, even animals and things like that. Getting them all placed on the planet is difficult yes, but there's harder types of planets to do.FS: Yeah.ST: One of the more difficult, and you've worked on things around this, is like procedural city-type planet. What then do we do and how do we keep it at that fidelity for a planet that's covered in an entire city?FS: Yeah.ST: That's a lot trickier, I think anyway.FS: Yeah. Well, you know, it's just a matter of you just making everything as modular as possible and then who knows what you could do ...ST: Exactly.FS: With the right game play code.ST: I hope that answered the question. I know we're being a bit obtuse, but it's only because we want to be able to show you.FS: Well, we haven't gone into a lot of things... yeah, yeah.ST: Yeah.

That will be more us on the PU, whatever you want to call it, sort of \"game master\" side, where we'll look at what's happening around in the universe and then we'll create occasional pockets of chaos - maybe there's a famine over here, maybe there's a bit of civil war breaks out over here - that will create events and missions for the players and the AI to participate in.So we'll look at it and there will be places where people may have to give aid, or come into fight off a Vanduul incursion or all sorts of stuff, and potentially space stations or who knows, a planet, could even get raised. But that would all be, I guess overall manipulation of the full PU to riff off what all the players are doing out there, kind of what the AI is doing in it's sort of systemic way, and then we sort of - like throwing a pebble into a smooth pond - put a few pebbles here and there to create ripple effects to create a little interest.

So, we were sort of building . . at the time when it was just Arena Commander, we want to change it around and have maybe some other modes to fight some other enemies.  In reality the Crusader map, which is the mini PU map, which is really going to grow into the Stanton star system map, where we sort of decided to put these different encounters whether it was with AI or you could find other players to fight.  And so that's essentially where Pirate Swarm went.So, in the short term we are not really planning on doing a lot of work on Arena Commander, because we really want to get the base game play and functionality into the proper large world map, the proper mini PU.  Get the various rock, paper, scissors aspects, the various different professions, the various different forces in opposition, and the various mechanics that keep people aligned whether you're good or bad or whatever.  For us Arena Commander, now is a good place to test some of your dogfighting skills.Longer term we will add to it.We will probably add some more challenge modes and definitely do better matchmaking and make that more of a competitive practice area.  Of course we'll do the same thing with Star Marine, but right now we really just sort of want to get everything into the mini PU because that's sort of our foundation for the overall game.  Then things will trickle later on into features for Arena Commander or Star Marine, which are really meant to be ultimately training modes for you to train in certain aspects of the game.  Potentially also to test your skills against other players without having the same sort of risk you would have in the proper Persistent Universe because it's persistent.

You will be able to go to a planet or to a spaceport and say \"hey change out my armor\" but I don't believe it's something you will be able to do through any of the repair functions. It's a lot more involved with your direct ship structural integrity than the repair stuff is more about layering over the...  your hull is technically just armor, it serves no other purpose but as far as field repair is concerned you will not be able to fabricate high density armor vs ablative armor or stealth armor or anything like that.

Similarly, the absolute extreme of this is Niobe's complete control of the logos in the Matrix Revolutions whilst escaping sentinels. Are we likely to experience environments like this within the PU (or missions in Squadron 42) that will equally challenge your piloting skill and the true maneuverability of your ship?", "answer": "I would say yes, definitely. I think we've mentioned before but jump points in some ways are going to be quite similar to this, not necessarily going through a death star but they are tunnels that collapse, undulate and move around and narrow and the more risky, the more unstable ones are worse that way but sometimes the risky, more unstable ones are the best shortcut to get to a location.What our plan is that navigating a jump point potentially if it's not a safe one could require some extreme piloting skills along the lines of what was described here. Then I'm pretty sure we'll have some other areas where whether it's flying inside a big structure in space or even down planetside, we'll put some challenges in there that are pretty cool. Possibilities are endless with the structure in the game we're building, it's one of the reasons it's taking so long but we are engineering it to do some pretty amazing things so I think you'll all appreciate that.

We're just sort of waiting to integrate 3.7, and then we'll integrate 3.8, which are the two most recent releases on the CryEngine side. It's always very complicated with us because we've modified the engine so much, it's not as simple as just getting it and putting it in in a day, it takes a long time to integrate them properly, but those integrations are holding off for us to finish the Star Marine work, and the stuff that we're doing for GamesCom. We're planning on doing the integration after GamesCom, and then it would be in one of the patches that would be in the Development branch, that would then go to release branch. I think you can look forward to using, or seeing some of the results of the 3.7 integration into our code base, probably towards the end of August or beginning of September, I would guess. But yes, we'll definitely take all of the updates they have for virtual reality in CryEngine and put it in. We still want to do some specific custom stuff on our side, and that's really a matter of engineering time on our side, and that's a matter of stuff settling. There's some pretty cool new stuff like the Valve headset as well, so that was on our longer-term roadmap, but right now we're focused on getting the large world and the zone system and Arena Commander 2.0 working, which is multi-crew, and then after that's where we get back on to focusing on some other stuff, and Virtual Reality will be one of them.", "published_at": "2015-07-27", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 61 (2015.07.27)", "source": "https://youtu.be/f8DX2VEeREY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Admiral Schemen", "published_at_timestamp": 1438036231}, {"objectID": "373682300", "question": "Dear Producers, We have seen the process of fixing bugs on bug smashers. \"Awesome programer sits down, thinks, and magic code fixes fly out of his fingers\" Is the process of implementing a new feature similar? A lot of people seem to think so. Could you walk us through beginning to end, the process of taking a feature, from an idea out of Chris Roberts' head (or someone elses) all the way to being played on our computers, including some obstacles you run into and how you over come them? Of particular instance to me are localized ship physics-instances, GOST, or grabby hands!", "answer": "Travis Day: So lets take uh, of this, I think the best would be... GOST. GOST is a really good example and we're going through it right now. So to step through that process, is the process similar to implementing a feature as fixing a bug. No, fixing a bug is part of implementing a feature. There's a whole stage for that at the end. The reality is every feature is a package of bugs that you haven't created yet. So with every feature you have to build in a bunch of QA and bug fixing time at the end, because it will happen. Even the best engineers on the planet, it's not even that they're making mistakes, it's just things evolve over time or this thing over here impacted them in a way that wasn't forseeable.So with the example of GOST though for example, we have a need in the game or a need gets identified. And that's really when you're talking about a new feature it's either a need or a new idea. In the example of GOST it was a need. We have the need to be able to understand where the player is versus where the ship is and what their respective states are so that we can have them interact in appropriate ways. Like not being able to get into a turret when somebody else is already in that turret or being aware that the ladder is down thusly you should climb the ladder rather than playing the deploy ladder animation. Or detecting the player to turn on lights.Anyways, tons of examples I could give you. But these were a list of needs, that were identified by Chris, by the designers. And so what basically happens is they go in, they write up a list of, \"Hey here are all the needs, here are the problems that we have that we need to solve in order to accomplish these things.\" And now generally this would be described as your GDD, your game design document, or your level design document or in this case a feature design document. These are the thing that we have that are a list of problems and then you take those and you hand those over to the engineering team. And they'll tell you, \"Okay, we think the best way to fix this would be...\" And then they document their technical design document. And they all peer review it and then they sit back down with the designers. They hold the two together and they kinda say, \"Okay is this really, is this the best solution for solving all of these problems in one holistic way.\" Then it comes to the, \"Okay! Greenlit, everybody is happy. This is exactly what we want to do, this is how we want to do it, everybody is onboard.\" We have the strike team formed. Then we literally sit down and break it down from beginning to end, and some of these things take 6 months, even longer. Then you say, \"Okay well here's where we're going to start. Here's the easiest, simplest, and then build, build, build. And you usually start with the framework, the foundation, and then build and add features on top of that. And then at the end or, throughout the process, but then at the end you'll have a long kind of buffer time, for QA, testing, bug fixing, integration into whatever the relevant stream that you're supposed to be in. So for example this feature might be built on that double pyramid down in Game Dev -> Arena Commander -> subset feature branch of GOST. And then it's getting constant integrations with Arena Commander and then eventually it needs to get integrated into that, integrated into main. So you have to put in maybe a weeks time, to solve any issues.So that's really the, the super basic and I could talk about it forever but I've probably gone too long already. The super basic process of taking a feature from an idea, to getting it all the way down into the game.Eric Kieron Davis: Yeah, great question.

The PU team is working a lot at creating a huge mix of environments, spaces, that reflect various cultures.  The distance between the culture and the widely populated system so, for example, if you're from Earth, everything around Earth will be built up and bustling, the further you get from Earth you'll start feeling a little more rough and tumble, the further you are from Earth's influence you're much more on that edge.

Graffiti is really interesting.  It's something we talked abou with one of the teams, that you wouldn't expect traditional graffiti, at least on a space station.

Would it be safe to assume we could use this craft for applications other than just combat?", "answer": "Most ships you can use in Star Citizen don't necessarily need to be all about combat. The thing with the Khartu-al is that it's very maneuverable, and has great visibility from the cockpit. So it's not necessarily as sturdy as something like a Hornet of course, but it has the ability to change direction pretty rapidly and be fairly quick. So you could, I think, use it as a scout, would be probably a good idea. I'm not sure about long range exploring because obviously it's not equipped to necessarily be long range like some of the other stuff like the Freelancer Duration, or some of the other ships that we're looking at as being more dedicated explorers. You could definitely use it for most things, probably other than hauling cargo, cos it's not really built for that - it doesn't really have a cargo hold.", "published_at": "2014-07-07", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 28.

Will we just have the ability to land and explore the planet, or will you have in-depth interaction with the environment. ex: If it's a city environment, will there be shops/bars and such that we could use? Or will that be released in the later game stages?Chris Roberts, you the man!", "answer": "All right, thank you very much for that. No, the Planet Side Module is essentially, we'll be opening up a bunch of the interactions that would happen down on the planet to everyone in the community to play with.The idea is, when you're in your hangar, there's a door in all the hangars to the outside world, you can go through that door, you would step out, and you would be in a planet side environment. We may debut with just one, or we may debut with a couple, and you can wander around in the environment, there would be shops where you could buy stuff. You could go to a bar where you could talk to people and ultimately in the game that's where you would look for missions or meet other players in the bar.The idea of the Planet Side Module is to test out and work on the functionality of all that which would happen once you land from space. So you will definitely have the ability to wander around and have some in depth interactions and do all that. Then as we go along, we would be adding more functionality and action to it, and then as the Persistent Universe is rolling out, there will be more areas to explore.The planet side stuff is one of our biggest tasks because there's a lot of them. We've got something like 450 different landing locations right now that we're talking about, and then you've got to build all the environments and the contents. So we're really working pretty hard on how to do that in a way that matches up to our quality of fidelity, but won't take 400 years to build.I think we've got a pretty good solution that uses a combination of unique stuff, some more modular stuff, and we are longer term researching some kind of procedural stuff to help build out and flesh out some environments based on criteria the economy system feeds in. And the Planet Side Module will all be testing grounds for that. Eventually it will just roll into the Persistent Universe.Think of the hangar as the hub, the hangar will get you to the dogfight, it will get you to the planet side, and then ultimately, it will get you into the Persistent Universe.", "published_at": "2014-05-19", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 21.

What are your thoughts on the architecture of  both and how they differ from the previous generation?", "answer": "Chris Roberts: I\u2019m much happier with what they\u2019ve done with the PS4 and Xbox One than what they did in the past. Basically it\u2019s a PC and it\u2019s actually going to make it a better situation for PC gamers. Now  a game built on next gen consoles is really just a PC game and so, I\u2019m going to get half these ports for powerful games that are some dynamic technology of seven years that still work on PC. But I think it\u2019s good\u2026certainly not as powerful as a really high end gaming rig but for the money, you can\u2019t really beat that value.<br/><br/>Basically Sony and Microsoft are selling at a cost. I sort of like systems as they are focused on gaming and you don\u2019t have a whole lot of other things in the way. The power up is decent and while it\u2019s not a high end game machine, you can do some interesting stuff on it. But I\u2019m much happier with the newer consoles than the old ones. I\u2019d say the Xbox One can be used for sort of kind of TV or non-gamey stuff and the PS4 is the better gaming machine.", "published_at": "2014-02-05", "title": "Star Citizen Interview: Chris Roberts On Building A Space Simulator For The Ages", "source": "https://gamingbolt.com/star-citizen-interview-chris-roberts-on-building-a-space-simulator-for-the-ages", "type": "article", "user": "Ravi Sinha", "published_at_timestamp": 1391558400}, {"objectID": "1aeb0ebcb3193b_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "If push comes to shove and you have to cut some features, what would be the first on the chopping block?", "answer": "There will be some features that will not make it as I'm sure some of my ideas wont work out once we start testing them with real users, and there will be some I haven't talked about will be in the game that everyone will wonder how we could have ever conceived not having.<br/><br/>Part of the reason of doing this with community involvement from the start is to make sure the people that will be affected by some early choices have a voice int he process.
