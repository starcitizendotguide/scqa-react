So until then we probably will reserve the right to reset stuff, but there may very well be a case before we consider it final, \"Go Live\", that we just decide: \"no, this is it, we're switching to proper UEC, everything is stable enough, and we'll go from here.\" And things that from that point on that you build up or earn would stay with you, although, to be honest with you, that probably is a pretty good definition of \"Go Live\".That's kind of it, like I said, not a hard and fast rule but those are kind of the thinking that we have as we're approaching it.", "published_at": "2016-04-11", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 82", "source": "https://youtu.be/3stBTV7QZzk", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Blade of Akire", "published_at_timestamp": 1460414681}, {"objectID": "373674980", "question": "In the recent 10 for the Chairman, there was mention of hacking a terminal to reduce wanted level. Given that in-universe, there is no FTL communication, will there be instances where someone can commit a crime in one system, jump three systems away, and the local police will scan them, but not realize they have a criminal, until the next 'Criminal Information' update comes in via Herald or Reliant News Van?", "answer": "Yes. Absolutely, 100 percent. That is the design.So even though we recognise that players can talk to each other on TeamSpeak or Discord or in channel chat, and that's basically instantaneous so it would be faster than light if you were talking to your buddy in another system and we can't block that because you can always just run an independent program, we will make sure that all the game systems themselves propagate properly in the game. So in terms of your wanted status in the game or when you are transferring funds or transferring goods they will all have to move via locations, to different things, as you would inside the physical setup of our game.So yes you could commit a crime, jump out of there and that may not have reached the system you've got to just yet. At some point it will, because the information will travel through the UEE Advocacy network and you'll become wanted in that system, but you'll maybe be able to \"beat\" the information. But that is also one of the reasons why an info-runner has a job because on the less structured systems like ... so a more regulated police system has a lot of communication satellites and information relays that are used to broadcast stuff around and then send the little drones through jump points to the other system which then broadcasts stuff around but that's in the structured infrastructure in the core of the UEE system ... the border ones you maybe won't get that or it will only be in certain areas or patchy and so things like  info-runners will be the courier that comes and passes information.So that's a good reason: maybe you don't want the message to get somewhere. Maybe someone does. So there's cool gameplay that comes from that.And I think also I should mention that in 2.2 right now we already kind of have a little bit of this gameplay where you can adjust your wanted level in Port Kareah and it adds a goal to be in Port Kareah. Also taking down or putting up the satellites basically enables whether there is coverage in that area. So whether you commit a criminal act or not, if the satellite's down then you can do what you want, if it's up and you shoot someone that you shouldn't shoot i.e. you shoot a lawful person, that isn't wanted, that doesn't have a bounty on them, then you become wanted too.So that's the very beginning fundamentals of the mechanic that we'll implement in the bigger system, that will have a lot more details and nuance to it. So what we have right now in 2.2 is the first iteration, which I think is cool because it provide some structure to the gameplay, but obviously it's a crude first implementation. So for instance we kick you when you are killed at level five to be your big penalty from the server now that is not a long term plan at all.Long term what will happen is when, depending on side of the law you fall in, when you essentially get killed, say when you become an outlaw you'll probably respawn in an outlaw friendly area or planet or asteroid base or whatever. And at a certain wanted level when you get killed you basically got captured and you'll go to a prison. And then you'll have to get out of the prison by escaping or just serving your time or bribing someone to come out it.So we'll make it more immersive and organic to the world but short term we needed ... because we don't have any way to pay people for money in 2.2 and we don't really have any sort of ... there's no persistence so we don't really have penalties so we sort of use the penalty of either locking you in your room for a little bit or kicking you from the server.

You're doing a series of very small, condensed actions of... you know, I'm gonna go over to my broken powerplant and I'm going open it up and see that it's on fire.  So, I'm going to use my extinguisher to put that fire out.  But, identifying that as the issue is part of the gameplay &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; there's the diagnostic element.  There's the triage element.  And then there's the subcomponent replacement element.  Each of those things is a simple process and don't particularly have... there's not a high barrier of entry on that.Where there is a lot of complexity is... all of this damage gets propagated into your ship based on the actual combat and the actual events of the game and the manner in which you take damage and the ways that you're stressing your ship are going to lead to different kinds of damage behaviours that will require different paired actions to fix.  What that means is that if you lose shields, that's a problem and the quickest path between not having shields to having shields again is not going to be clear to the inexperienced repairman.  So, understanding which parts of this shield component are critical to it functioning at all versus the ones that allow it to have a lot of health or fast recharge or accommodates the coolant &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; these each function separately so you can have a terrible but functional component if you choose to repair only the critical path which could be difference between life and death in combat and then if you are noob you can work through in whatever order you discover these issues, you can work through them and solve them individually until eventually you have a working component again and through doing that you might organically begin to discover which parts of this are actually required for it to function versus which are required for it to be any good.Matt Sherman: So yeah, a bunch of plans.CR: Yeah, it's important to have both levels of difficulty by layering a bunch of simple things.MS: Yeah, it's much more approachable as a learned action so, the more you play the better you get... or the more you invest yourself into the system, it's going to reward you for that personal investment.CR: Yeah... different components are also different so there will be plenty of things to learn about.", "published_at": "2015-06-29", "title": "10 for the Designers: Episode 05 (2015.06.29)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Neo404oDUyI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Amontillado", "published_at_timestamp": 1455576909, "time": "1m51s"}, {"objectID": "373679930", "question": "Is it possible to raid a supply shipment, not for piracy, but to destroy it to possibly damage a rival orgs cargo thus it's revenue and operations?", "answer": "Yes absolutely.

So you're going to need, we've mentioned it before, but you'll need things like fuel; certain kinds of ammunition are obviously consumable, so ballistics are consumable, there'll be other sorts of consumables that'll happen. So if you're out on the frontier or you're waging a war there'll definitely be the need to rearm, restock, refuel and you'll have to get those arms and weapons: maybe someone can sell them to you; maybe your org has someone coming in with a supply ship to do that. We have a variation of the Crucible that would be a restock and supply version that you could use in the background to backdrop an offensive to bring it in.We definitely want to make that part of gameplay for the bigger organisations team play because we think one of the most interesting things is not just the frontline combat but how people work together as a team to achieve things and obviously the logistics are pretty good with that. And therefore one of the techniques to degrade your opponent is to go for its supply line.

And what happens if you leave, so.RJ: I think you do. Take him and toss him out, make his head explode.TD: Space him? Well, you know, in the longer term, I think there's been a lot of discussion about what capabilities does AI have. Like, if I own 5 Freelancers, can I have them all fly with me? They're all different AI pilots, different AI gunners, or is it just going to be the ability to say hey, take this from this planet to this planet, and I'm going to go be over here, and this is just going to happen, and hopefully it's a good AI pilot, what will their skills be, what can they get better at. These are all things that the PU team is exploring right now, and we don't have a firm solid final design on what exactly AI characters in the PU will or will not be able to do, and what kind of areas of learning that they have, but I do think there are some cool ideas floating around now, that are in the process of being locked down.

And if that's the case, that will probably show the relative positions of stars and constellations, as you would from that system around our setup. And then also when you're looking down on planets we actually do model the planet, so we will model... like, if there's a city or light pollution, we would probably put that into the planet.Not so sure about like being on Earth, looking up and seeing the Big Dipper and all that sort of stuff. CryEngine itself actually has that model for Earth itself for the first person stuff. The issue for us would be modelling what the stars would look like from various planets because we can visit hundreds. So we haven't necessarily made a decision on what that would look like. We probably will be using sky and light boxes on different locations and then they can probably be done in such a way that they would generally represent what would be in that area, so if you're like near a nebula and you're looking up from a planet you should maybe potentially see the constellations you would see from that planet.

So there isn't any one, it's not like everyone says \"this one control method is the best.\" Like I said, I myself don't like flying mouse at all, but some other people do like playing mouse. I guess it falls into are you a Freelancer player or a Wing Commander player? But we're still wanting to refine it.We're not happy with the mouse control, I don't actually like the fact that you sort of fly and look at the same time, but we do recognize that on small precision stuff, having the mouse is easier for some of the gimbaling weapons. So we're trying to balance it.We've got, like I said on the previous question, there's some stuff that's gonna come online for the joystick and HOTAS that will make that better for that side of it. Then there's also some stuff that we'll do on the mouse side that will maybe decouple the movement from the look.But it's still early days, we're still working on it, we're still thinking about different ways of doing it. That's kind of why I wanted to get it out there, to feel what worked and what didn't work for people.I know there are always camps, right. There's the keyboard & mouse FPS crowd verses the old school \"get off my lawn, I've got a joystick and I've been playing that game since 1980\" crowd, which would be pretty much me.But my goal is to balance it in a way that you have advantages with any one of the control interfaces so there won't be one that will be dominant.

I'm actually not enjoying the final stages because I like so many of the ships and I think all the teams are so talented that it kind of sucks that there's only gonna be one winner.So there may be a way we'll try to find to get more of those ships into the game, but I definitely think there should be some way that we can have where people could potentially design ships or even items, maybe to specs that we publish and we say \"we need this\" kind of like the US government says \"We need a new aircraft, well let's put it out to bid\" and they put it out, then Boeing and Lockheed, and, well they used to compete, I guess they're all the same now. But they do their designs, and get them in, and the winning bid goes on to manufacturing stuff.Potentially I think definitely that, in terms of actually manufacturing it in the universe, I like the idea that you have to go and get the raw resources to make the stuff or make sure you're sourcing the CPU components from another factory. Potentially we'll allow you to acquire, say you've got a ship factory, then maybe you can acquire a license to manufacture a certain kind of ship, and then you could be the local provider of that ship. Or an NPC manufacturing center would be. So they're kind of split.I guess it's the difference between people doing user generated stuff and then actually stuff that you sell in game. But they're both things that we're looking at, and we long term want to put in the game, whether it be from the very beginning or not, that's another question. There's a lot of things or us to do, but that's definitely a long term thing.I think the community providing a lot of the content, both in terms of adventure and action, and also things in general is super good for the life of the game. That's one of the reasons why people still play Freelancer today even though it came out over 10 years ago. It's because of the modding side, and that's why we're supporting modding. So we are gonna find a way to do that, we're just gonna have to juggle it a bit, and of course on your own, if you're modding your own stuff to play around your own version of the universe, then you can do whatever you want.", "published_at": "2014-05-19", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 21.

Whether it's a HOTAS outfit, or keyboard and mouse, gamepad, regular joystick, Oculus Rift, TrackIR, rudder pedals, that's part of the spirit of PC gaming, so CryEngine is quite good at having a lot of different inputs.In the Dogfight Module, when you play you'll be able to have your HOTAS set up, and a mouse and a keyboard, and all the rest, you can be flying them all--using them all at the same time if you want.So we'll do that. As far as the head-tracking functions for the Dogfighting Module, I'm not sure about Dogfighting v1. We'll probably have the Rift working for it, 'cause we already have the Rift working in the hangar, but we're really trying to do some extra stuff on the Rift to have proper stereoscopic dual rendering as opposed to a post-stereoscopic rendering. And there's still some head lag issues that we're dealing with. We've made it better, but there's some that we're dealing with at the engine level that we're working with Crytek on.I don't think we'll have TrackIR and stuff ready for the Dofight v1, but that is definitely on our list of stuff to work on.So you can see that come in along the line when we start to patch stuff.", "published_at": "2014-03-24", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 13 (2014.03.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/IIkeFs5xubw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Killashnikov", "published_at_timestamp": 1395698672}, {"objectID": "1264212001", "question": "We know that Star Citizen will also have a single-player component. Could you provide a few details on the same?", "answer": "Chris Roberts: It\u2019s Squadron 42, the single-player component and it\u2019s essentially Wing Commander, a next-generation Wing Commander set in our universe and it has a really great story which I think people are really going to like. But it\u2019s that style of gameplay, you\u2019re out in a military carrier, running military missions\u2026it\u2019s more linear than the open Star Citizen sandbox with the Universe but it\u2019s got characters and narrative than a sandbox game.<br/><br/>Right now, we don\u2019t want to talk much about the story since that would kind of ruin it. But I think it\u2019s pretty cool and the key to building that is our newest studio in Manchester, UK and it\u2019s my brother and all his team members and leaders that were at Traveller\u2019s Tales, making LEGO games the last seven years and before that they built Star Lancer for me and Digital Anvil and they also built Privateer 2. They\u2019re incredibly knowledgeable and they\u2019re really great and they\u2019re taking the lead on it.
