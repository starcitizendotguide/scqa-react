The majority of their inhabitants generally work for the corporate owner, with any additional population being made up of those who have set up independent businesses to supply food, clothing, non-corporate provided housing, and other necessities.

The format varies depending on the subject. An episode may present actual footage or re-enactments of incidents to examine a mystery, coupled with interviews with involved individuals or commentary from experts. Cold cases, supernatural phenomena, unexpected alien discoveries, missing persons, and unexplained historical events are the most common topics. The show's introductory monologue has become an element of popular culture, especially the final line, \"These are the universe's <em>Untold Tales</em>,\" or \"This is <em>Untold Tales</em>.\"  </p><br/><h1>FORMAT</h1><br/><p>Each episode of <em>Untold Tales</em> opens with a montage composed of footage, images, and re-enactments that will be used in the episode, over which the host recites a monologue expounding on the unexplained happenings of the universe. Usually one mystery is covered, but sometimes up to three are explored in depth. At the end of each episode, the host wraps things up by asking unanswered questions raised by the mystery, inviting the viewers to solve it if they can. If a cold case was the main focus, the host asks the audience to contact the show if they have any information that will help bring the perpetrator to justice.</p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p><em>Untold Tales</em> began as a series of seven specials hosted by Ellroy Cass and Saanvi Tejwani beginning in 2945, covering famous paranormal phenomena throughout the UEE, such as the Hades cryptid and the lost civilization of Terra (Terra III). The specials earned high ratings, so much so that the producers ordered a full-fledged series. At first, the plan was to continue with two hosts, but Cass declined to sign the contract when they accepted a starring role in the then-upcoming film <em>Crimson Tower</em>. Production continued, and the first episode debuted in mid-2945 with Tejwani at the helm. It covered the 2711 unsolved robbery of the Greater Davien Bank and Trust, the mystery of the empty starliner <em>Gisele Tamar</em> discovered drifting near Abyss (Orion IV) in 2903, and reported ghost sightings near the site of the long-since-collapsed Oretani jump point. </p><br/><p>Tejwani's grave yet dramatic narration style quickly became synonymous with the show. Apparel featuring her signature line \"These are the universe's <em>Untold Tales</em>,\" sold out in its first run on Voyager Direct. When Tejwani took a leave of absence for personal reasons in 2947, ratings experienced a sharp drop, only to recover when Tejwani returned late that same year. </p><br/><h1>UPDATES</h1><br/><p>Viewers are occasionally given updates when a case is solved. Most famously, missing person and former child star Eliu Jalan Cervantes, abducted in 2940, was found living on Delamar in the Nyx system in 2948 under the assumed name Uriel Kane thanks to an anonymous tip from viewers. His manager Liberato Kane was arrested and convicted of the kidnapping, and Cervantes returned to his family.

One of the fall outs of iCache, which we\u2019ve been working on for full persistence of state and location of all dynamic objects in the universe of Star Citizen, is that recording and restoring a building you\u2019ve just constructed is really no different to remembering where you dropped your coffee cup on some distant planet, or which shelf you placed it on in your hab.<br/><br/>Basically, iCache will enable us to allow all of you to settle the stars!<br/><br/>When we first came up with the concept of player built outposts and land claims iCache hadn\u2019t been technically designed, but now we have a system that will have a much higher degree of fidelity in remembering where each building or component is and what state it is in. So rather than just dropping down a singular Outpost, you\u2019ll be able to place down various structures and connect them to things like power generators, turrets, resource collectors, hydroponic domes and so on.<br/><br/>In parallel with this we\u2019ve been working on tools to build settlements or homestead both for our artists / designers (more of a RTS god like view) and players (a first person view).<br/><br/>With this we\u2019ve been rethinking how the Pioneer will work to make her more flexible rather than just spitting out a pre-fabricated outpost we want her to me more of a mobile fabrication facility that would be near your building site. With a Pioneer you\u2019ll be able build these structures without having to ship in the component parts as long as you have a supply of raw materials. You don\u2019t need a Pioneer to build a homestead but if you want to build a decent settlement, or you want to build something relatively quickly as opposed to having to fly in prefabricated components from major landing zones you will want to have a Pioneer, or have a friend or someone that is willing to lend their services to you.<br/><br/>We\u2019re very excited about the gameplay that all of this will provide and can\u2019t wait to see what kind of player settlements sprout up over the huge amount of land area the game has.

Really it gives them a way to scale better so that they can put more content and more features in, but not so much that there's some added behaviour or feature that SSOCS adds in that now the feature can do something that it couldn't do before. The tech that they write to create SSOCS could enable, but it's not server streaming that does it, it's more that the foundational technologies that they make in order to create SSOCS could themselves lend to some interesting future development, which is especially true with Global Persistence. SSOCS requires this to work, because they have to stream out an area and store it out, but GP is something that they really want in the game and doesn't require server streaming and could technically have it without it (although the performance wouldn't be good), but it's something that they're making that could be thought of as a feature that they made along the way in support of SSOCS.<br>Todd adds that the only thing that the game teams will be responsible for will be making sure that their game code works with SSOCS, which means that if they're doing that then they're not doing feature development, which is unfortunate but also a necessary evil.

You won't have these long, drawn out cutscenes that are noninteractive all over the place. The cutscenes were designed, written and shot in a way to give a large amount of different variety and how they play out. Some do take control fully away from the player but for very specific reason, if that makes sense. There's also a large amount that are fully interactive, and then there's hybrids that put the player in a defined path but the player still has some sense of movement and sense of control.So, I really do think once these all come together you're going to get a whole good mix and it's really going to feel very fluid and seamless. We also have added elements to the scenes where they branch, but branch in a very relaxing, casual, sensible way so the player has some choice but it's not like, you know, things pause and the AI roams until you push a button.

Yeah we've actually already started to break down from a lore perspective many different varieties of clothes. I'm sure you've heard of this mentioned before, stuff like Earth blue collar, Tera fashion casual, Frontier fashion, stuff like that. So we have all these different companies and all these different kinds of looks that we'll be able to give characters in certain areas. So you'll be able to be walking around Tera and see people in very kind of sleek and futuristic clothes with very clean simple lines and then right next to them you may see somebody in a leather duster with kind of like boots and straps and stuff like that, which would definitely fall into more of the Frontier fashion type category. So I think that'll be a way to help the different landing zones, the place you visit, feel more even more diverse just based on the clothes, the wear on that clothes and everything like that as you were mentioning before.Now when it comes to the mission system, from what I believe and again I have to caveat this because I'm not 100 percent sure on this...

If they don't like the fact that you walk into their bar in like this sharp three piece suit, that bartender may not give you a certain mission, even if you may be a criminal or do some pirate activities, just based on the look of you, they may not be able to do that and I know one of the goals is to make it so NPC's aren't necessarily omniscient as to all your actions and that's one of the ways to do that is providing a variety of clothing and clothing styles and then that becomes a very simple way that you're telling the world how you want that world to respond back to you.Omar Aweidah: That's a really good point. I think from a design perspective I really can't, again from a game design perspective, I don't know exactly how that works, but what we are doing is we are planning for some of that kind of different styles of the jackets, trench coats, that kind of thing and also make sure that they match so you don't just look ridiculous because then everyone... it's gonna be like Christmas hats and green slippers and stuff, so we do really try to stay within the manufacture and find a nice style for that manufacture and then make sure that we provide a colour palette that works really with that and where that is. How the NPC's interactive with that or the AI interact with that, I really don't know as of right now, but I mean you guys are looking into it as well as some of the game designs.AW: Yeah a lot of these things, we set this in place so the designers can pick it up and run with it, but for us to being able to be so specific will help that and give it that kind of give that diversity.", "published_at": "2016-05-09", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 09", "source": "https://youtu.be/fLMjmYvHOUk", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "AragornBH", "published_at_timestamp": 1462829402}, {"objectID": "373674490", "question": "I had my wings shot off in the 'baby' PU (ok,ok, I actually crashed into something) and my guns went with them. Will I have to buy new guns every times this happens when the game 'goes live'?", "answer": "So that is a pretty good question. These are all the \"lovely\" edge cases that come up with the lifetime insurance or the insurance set up.But generally if you damage your ship when you are flying out there and you have to go and get it repaired you're going to have to pay to repair it and typically, just like it would be in the real world if you drive and get your car messed up and the wheel goes and stuff then you have to pay to get that wheel repaired or whatever. If ... depending on what kind of insurance ... because don't forget we're also going to sell, besides the basic hull insurance, which is the normal insurance and the lifetime insurance, which covers you from catastrophic loss, there will be additional insurance you could purchase for item or weapons. So if you put a custom weapon on your ship and you take it out and you got in a fight and it got blown up, if you have the right insurance then perhaps it will pay out.But that kind of insurance will obviously act a lot like real insurance would, so it's not blind. If you go back and you make claim after claim after claim after claim after claim then your rates are going to go up and at some point they may not want to insure you any more. Because the one thing we have to juggle on the whole idea of your ship actually being something that you want to hold onto and keep and patch up and repair, and our insurance set up, is that we don't want people to abuse the system. You don't want people to just go and destroy ... like \"Oh look I've lost a wing so I'm just going to suicide into rock now so I can get an insurance claim to get a brand new ship back and not pay for the repair\".So we are going to work in systems that will try to watch out for that and people aren't going to be able to just claim, claim, claim, claim, claim, claim, claim, and get a ship instantly back. So there'll be some penalties for going ... losing your ship, and insurance covers it, but if it starts to happen too long then maybe it takes a while for you to get your next ship, maybe there's a little extra scrutiny. Because what we don't want to do is people use it to abuse the system, which you guys have come up with a thousand different scenarios of how that can happen.It's one of the good things about having the Alpha stage, it's why we're going to do Alpha UEC, sharpening the persistence up there and a lot of this stuff, is a lot of this kind of dynamics will start to experiment with the functionality of how the insurance and how you would respawn and all the rest of stuff, during the Alpha, Mini PU, basis. And of course we're going to adjust it as it develops and that's why we really want to have hundreds of thousands of you playing it. Because it is way, way, way, way better way to test it out and see what works and what doesn't work compared to just the Dev team doing it. Because you just don't have enough people and you are set in a certain mindset. And you guys can see it every time we take something to PTU, and then even sometimes Live, there are bugs or exploits that show up that the Dev team never even considered, that the QA team never came across. Mostly because we set on a certain way and the QA team, even though it's a pretty big QA team now, there's ... it's a huge game and a huge universe and lots of stuff to be done.And so we will be working on exactly these things as ... some of the key game mechanics that I've talked about, that I think can be really interesting, but I'm not stupid enough to say \"it's definitely going to work exactly this way\" because you've got to get out there, Live, and play around when it's Alpha UEC and we can reset people's accounts and no one's really lost anything at that point. So hopefully with all you guys help, and playing it, will come up with something that is a really nice balance between making you want to hold onto your stuff, care about your character and care about your ship and not sillily blow it up or sacrifice it, but also not be the other extreme where it's so frustrating that you have to start from scratch every time you go out and some pirate shoots you up.So those are all things that we will work on together.

But there will definitely probably be some things you can collect.We're thinking of sort of having gameplay on some of the procedural planets that would be things like mining or mineral collection and doing stuff like that and that's actually fairly simple to implement and so we're thinking on the PU of some pretty interesting and fun kind of low hanging fruit in gameplay for you guys to play with.

Will CIG also create new logos for fast food restaurants for the Persistent Universe, such as a pizza join, taco stand or ice cream parlor?", "answer": "Eric Kieron Davis: But the question for this group really, and it goes back to how we work together, we're going to have a lot of stuff happening in our game all over the place, we're going to have all kind of shops and things like that; what level does that impact you guys in the way that you do your job? Again this goes back to, and I'm feeding from the first question, when you see how a shop works is that more driven by you [Adam] do you come up with a name? Or do you [Calix] say \"no I think the name should be this\"? Based on a shop how does that stuff come together? How does that usually work?Calix Reneau: I work mostly with the ships, and so the ships obviously integrate with the rest of the game but as those parts come online we have things like the billboards that go on the Hull series; or the whole commercial bazar that goes on the Merchantman. So we have those things being build out and integrated into our ships and there's a back-and-forth on that: what makes for a good walkable space in your ship; what makes for a good thing to just find out in space; what's been designed to be on the terrestrial when you go down planetside. So those things definitely intersect.Forrest Stephan: It's generally a combination of art and literature because they'll put shops in the stories some time, right?Adam Wieser: Yeah, we've definitely seeded a bunch of specific locations and specific shops that are either universally around or just in a specific location so if you're going to go to this specific landing zone we probably already know the name of the shop there, who running it,  so that way when you guys get to that point of building it out. having to design it, you can come to us and we can let you know \"oh, this is going to be the dark bar where people are going to come in and do info agent stuff\".I know from our perspective too, we already have a working doc open for all the writers so that if we have an idea for a fun billboard or something that might elicit anything, and it doesn't have to be related to a product in the game it could be for like \"learn Xi'an today\" so it's like instead of \"learn Spanish\" or \"learn French\". We have a working doc, if you think of one you just drop the idea in there because we have had request from the PU Team in Austin to be like \"hey we just need stuff to be able to populate the backgrounds and the street corners and stuff like that\". So we're maybe not focusing every day on it but if you get one of those ideas over the course of the week you drop it in and you slowly build up that list so when it comes time for them needing more of them we've got already a database set aside for that.CR: That seven hour workshop, perfect for the trader on the go!AW: Yeah. Exactly. Exactly!EKD: Perfect.FS: We make sure that all the style guides are taking the literature and starting to build out these logos. You see it in ArcCorp right? We've got some logos. I'm sure we'll repeat, we're very modular, environment so I don't see any reason why we couldn't have corporate shops or a string of shops that show up in different locations.AW: Cubby Blast and Casaba Outlet and all those.

The unit space in the engine is setup on meters so one year is one meter, and the center of the solar system would be where the star that everything  would orbit around, or the multiple star systems would orbit around and so right now in terms of flying around that like locations we kind of have a debate whether or not give you set nav points, okay here's arriving at this planet, or arriving at the asteroid field, So there sort of navigation points you can enter, and then also whether you could enter random sort of XyZ position to quantum to or we make you sort of fly to a cruise speed first basically enter that location into your nav computer and then you could broadcast it to your friends and it would be an entry, which is kind of sort of one of the explorer developer options so we're sort of playing around with that concept but you know we are going to allow you to sort of set or explore or find off beaten path places but you know have pre done navigation points. So it's almost like you would on a gps I guess. Then on the galaxy wide coordinates we would specify what system you're in, so you're in Stanton System, you're in sol system, you're in Tara system, so then you know we would be potentially sol system, earth, or sol system at this XYZ location and that will potentially see how it works because we've had some debates about actually having orbital mechanics, so obviously in XYZ position doesn't really work unless it's relative, because you know if you want to go to earth it's going to be at a different point, it won't be there. So those are kind of the things we need to flesh out. Right now in the large world map and multi-crew map it's XYZ, in meters and we give you pre determined nav points and you can sort of unlock more and more of them by exploring around and doing stuff like that.", "published_at": "2015-09-28", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 68", "source": "https://youtu.be/FkjfyVDhzNs", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Doc Tari", "time": "6m15s", "published_at_timestamp": 1443477905}, {"objectID": "373681410", "question": "Can you give us some insight as to how electronic warfare will work in the PU?", "answer": "Next week I think we are going to talk about some of the Vanguard variants, one of them which will be an Ewar version and will go into some of the basic high-level design that we are thinking about for electronic warfare, that you will also be using for the Hornet Ghost that sort of has the kind of Ewar component to it. It will be pretty good, I mean there's basically sort of a couple of different ways of going about it. One we have long-range intercept and blocking of signals and transmission so obviously not necessarily when you are talking to people because you can sort of sort of circumvent that with Teamspeak and Skype but if you are giving sort of direct commands to people to attack this target or do that and also the fidelity of the targets &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; being able to scan and do all that sort of stuff. You can intercept those, you can jam 'em, you can do all that stuff. Shorter range you can, we have concepted sort of these data missiles you can send out and that will allow a connection to your target and then if you get in there you can sort of hack the systems and shut down some of the critical systems on someone else's ship. So we have a combination of sort of blocking, spoofing and sort of disruption stuff and then obviously the defenses against that plus we sort of have a kind of like hacking control component and we will go into more detail next week but I think it'll be pretty cool.

Have there been a lot of hurdles going from the DirectX 8 era where games had rudimentary physics at best, straight into development of a high end multiplayer game from the DirectX 11/12 era?", "answer": "Well, it's actually been fun.  I think some of you out there know that in the early days when we showed the prototype, and this was back in October of 2012, I was pretty much the programmer.  So, I'd coded most of the stuff that we'd shown.  I'd done a bunch of changes to CryEngine itself to enable us to do some of that stuff. I'd had some help from a few people like Paul Reindell who now works with us, who was at the time at Crytek and part of the support department they had there in terms of software engineers that supported the SDK, worked on that SDK and then worked with outside people like myself.  But, I did most of the coding.  Luckily, no one has really migrated in high end game coding to a new language so C++ was something &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; actually back in the early days, I think I was probably one of the early adopters of C++.  I wrote Wing Commander in C and then for Strike Commander &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; the engine we wrote for Strike Commander was the foundation of the 3D engine that ran most of the Origin games after that, so all of the stuff we did for the later Wing Commanders, a lot of Warren [Spector] stuff &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; things like Wings of Glory, Pacific Strike &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; and some of the stuff that Andy Hollis did was originally all based on the engine that we first built for Strike Commander.  So that was the first project I did in C++.  We built a pretty... you know, for the time if you look back on what we did, we had a whole bunch of firsts in the graphics world.  I know that a lot of credit goes to id [Software] for having 'invented 3D' but really there was quite a lot of 3D before id [Software] ever got around to doing proper 3D.  So, you know, Paul Neurath who recently has just had the Underworld Kickstarter, that was successfully funded, that he is working on &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; he had done some pretty awesome 3D stuff.  Sid Meier had done some with F19.  Of course with Strike Commander, we were first one to do proper real-time 3D Gouraud shading and real-time texture mapping and if you go back and look at Strike Commander you can actually see that we had virtual cockpits all the way back in 1991/1992 which is pretty cool.  But, that was the first project I used C++ &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; for whatever reason I always liked the brand new, shiny stuff... try out the new tech.  So, back then we worked with Borland, C &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; and C++ came out and me and Jason Templeman who was the lead programmer working with me, we dove in and learned C++ as we went along and I quite like it.  It works well for the way I think and organize things and people still use C++ all these years later.So, when I first got back into doing Star Citizen it wasn't really that different.  There's newer functions &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; some of the later stuff like the STL stuff and the Boost stuff is all newer parts of the lexicon of C++ and various stuff you do.  There's a little bit of that but the fundamentals are the same and so it was kind of like riding a bike and it was actually kind of fun because it's one of the few areas that you can sort of control what you're working on and you can make things happen.  So, it's actually quite empowering and fulfilling when you say, \"I've got an idea of something I want to see happen,\" and you go and program it and you actually see it happen that way and simulate that way on the computer you're working on... it's great.So, I had a lot of fun.  Obviously I have a physics background from a long time ago so that obviously helps.  And, to honest with you, tools you have now with modern engines are fantastic.. I mean, compared to what we had in the old days when we had to everything with a scratch writer or an editor &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; just starting out of the box with something as powerful as CryEngine was great.It's a lot of the same concepts, you can just do a lot more of it, a lot more powerful, and it's fun.  So, I don't really feel like the old guy who doesn't know how to do this stuff, you know, but I definitely think my background helped me.  There's definitely some stuff we're doing in Star Citizen that is really pushing things and it's cool so I'm having a lot of fun actually... I wish I could be doing more programming rather than some of the other stuff that I have to do but that's not always the case on a big project, having to direct and communicate with so many people.", "published_at": "2015-08-03", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 62", "source": "https://youtu.be/zt4r3ksHXng", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Oberscht", "published_at_timestamp": 1438639238}, {"objectID": "373682220", "question": "I know you have posted some about this in your feedback threads already, but could you give us an overview of this activity, especially anything that submitters can do to make the feedback more useful, as well as more details on how this feedback will be communicated to and used by the rest of the QA and the ship designers?", "answer": "Vincent Sinatra: Yeah, so basically what I'm trying to do is, because it seems like we are getting so much feedback, I mean I had pages and pages and pages of feedback ...Randy Vasquez: Which sounds pretty awesome by the way.VS: It was very awesome. I mean the community is very passionate and they gave us just tonnes of information but some of it was information overload for developers and designers who are already working hard on new things.

We still need numbers ...VS: Yeah, we're still breaking it down. Like I said, I was rapid fire, machinegun style getting that stuff out.

But as far as what details, just keep things concise; keep things clear. Try to keep things within scope: we're not always looking for \"Hey, please buff my favourite ship\" type of stuff. You want to make sure you know exactly the type of thing we're looking for. Perhaps on my part I need to be a little more clear as to what we're asking for. Now we've even had some growing pains through some of the threads wit that ...RV: Yeah. That's the thing with some of the other stuff we were talking about earlier is I would love for people to break down the feedback from different sections.VS: Definitely.RV: So even multiple post so that way like \"Hey, this is the arts posts on this\". So that way you give everything for art, break it down to design, mechanics ...VS: Exactly. Mechanics, balance ...RV:  ... to break it down as much as possible. Yeah, balance-wise like \"Alright so I'm flying a 300, I'm flying a 315, they're almost the same ship but not really\". But then just breaking it down that thing like as much as ... don't be as verbose. Clear, concise: definitely. But don't be afraid to give more examples or give, at least ... because the examples you guys give, as well as just the detail you guys can give us, anything is useful.VS: Yeah and I was pretty much amazed at the detail because we had graphics ...RV: Yeah!VS: Particularly for the 300, people were like \"Hey this is how the redesign could totally work\" and I'm like \"Is this a resume? Is this a job application? Or is this just normal feedback?\". So the detail was crazy good in some regards and then in others people are all like \"Hey, give me a buff\". For the most part. I want, I want ...RV: Make this ship the most powerful.VS:  ... I want five gimbals on my ship! Or something like that. Those we don't ...RV: I love those gimbals.VS:  Hey who doesn't? But for the most part as long as it is clear, as long as it is concise. Keep things polite in the threads. If somebody says something you don't agree with, hey we're all trying to make the best game together. That's the great thing about our community is we're working together.RV: And honestly, the pointing out that thing, if you guys have things different, varying opinions that is perfectly fine. We actually welcome that because then we see different perspectives on how people are looking at the designs, how people are looking at the ships, the role of the ship, everything. Any feedback is good feedback.VS: Yeah.RV: We can't always act on everything and we're not going to be acting on it instantly so give us time because we're still working on things. We only have so many people to actually do everything.VS: Yeah. And I'm going to try and make it easier for the devs and designers to digest when it does come in. Try to get a top 5 bullet points and \"Here's the rest of the report when you guy get around to it but these are major things that are either really bothering the community or they're really excited about getting implemented for their particular favourite ships\".RV: It would be super useful.VS: Yeah.

For example, games like CS or Call of Duty open force specific bottlenecks and experienced players learn to anticipate the most likely attack strategy; or will the design of Star Marine encourage for more free-form and unexpected strategies for both sides?", "answer": "Travis Day: It's a combination of both actually. I think choke points and focus for areas is important in map design. This is something where I really wish I was back in Denver so I could talk to Rodney about it because Rodney is our lead designer and he's very conscious of map design. One thing that's very important to him and important to us - we don't design maps that can be used for a multitude of game modes. So, in the most recent Call of Duty you might see... it's the same map but you can play all 10 game modes on it and there are some very light changes to it. But, we're really big on the idea of designing the entire flow of the map to support one specific game mode because there are a lot of little nuance things that you can change and adjust that maybe work for one game mode but don't work for another.So, for example, if I think about Gold Horizon - the two starting areas are opposing on another, this is pretty standard. There's about three, and then immediately four alternate routes that you can take to engage one another so it keeps too much of the bottleneck from happening and too much of the focus from happening. When you get into those next rooms there's a lot of verticality to them so you can go up, down, left, right, and it also makes it cool for zero-G because there is a gravity generator in there. There are a lot of options and a lot of open spaces but also narrow corridors, so what's fun is if you - for example - kit yourself out with a light marine with a light loadout but you're super quick, you can actually run down, go around, get into the main warehouse area on the bottom floor and usually get up before people who are in the heavier armour have gotten out from the base. So there's a lot of different - depending on who you are and how you kit yourself out and how you like to play and if you want to be stealthy or tanky - there's different routes that are more conducive to that style. You can do whatever you want, it's just interesting the way the different dynamics play. It's really a lot of fun to playtest... I honestly can't wait to release it for you guys so you can check it out and you don't have to ask these questions... you just play it for yourself!", "published_at": "2015-05-04", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 06 (2015.05.04)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Jmsn9aURZ4Q", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Plastix", "published_at_timestamp": 1430776682}, {"objectID": "373677820", "question": "How often do you envision average players dying and being replaced by their heirs?", "answer": "That's pretty open ended, it's kind of hard to say, how many hours do these players play? Are they regularly in combat? Or are they trading in a very safe area? It all depends, I would say that dying and being replaced by heirs I'd not want to be a very frequent event for players, but there'll be people getting badly hurt and fixed up, so I think that people would only get replaced by their heirs after 6,7,8 lives, and depending on what your play-style could be, it might not happen for a year or two, or even players that have never lost a character ever. For normal play style I'd say it'd have to be something particularly infrequent, but it's so hard to give an exact timeline because it all depends on all of these factors, just like in real life!", "published_at": "2014-11-24", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 46 (2014.11.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/FXnNwUmnl3o", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Tumoroh", "published_at_timestamp": 1416870046}, {"objectID": "373678630", "question": "In regards to mining, will we be able to refine raw materials ourselves in order to cut out a middleman or will we have to bring them to some planet and pay for someone to refine them for us?", "answer": "I would say in the mining stuff, you're going to refine the raw materials, at some point we'll likely enable players or organisations to own nodes down the chain, so maybe there'll be a specialist refinery ship, or a node in a factory on a planet. So if you owned that node you'd be able to refine and sell it on as a more finished resource or whatever that'll be. We definitely want to allow players to focus on engaging in the economic aspect of the PU if they want to, and not have to focus so much on the combat side of it. That's really one of the big things of SC, is being able to take multiple roles, and encourages people to play co-operatively together so yes, there'll definitely be head to head/pvp stuff, but one of the coolest things is that you've got a lot of opportunities for co-op play, like multicrewed ships, or a few different ships involved in a mining operation or something. It's all about who you want to be, mercenaries, explorers, traders, search and rescue, bounty hunters, pirates, all these things make the strength of SC, either by yourself or with your friends.", "published_at": "2014-09-29", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 39 (2014.09.29)", "source": "https://youtu.be/7mTLWkxEEeo", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Greenman", "published_at_timestamp": 1412028036}, {"objectID": "373685920", "question": "How will we be able to disengage from combat? Will it always require us to have a faster ship than our adversaries or will there be other ways to evade them?", "answer": "Again that's a good question, and that's a balance thing so we haven't 100% figured out would it always just be about out running, or would there be other ways? We're certainly going to allow you to control your radar image in terms of how hot or quite you are basically, so there potentially could be, depending on the situation and environment, there definitely could be places where you could essentially hide behind an asteroid field and turn all your systems off and then you would have almost no radar profile and then you would go off people's scopes and then they could potentially pass along so that would be one way to get out of it. And then of course if you had a faster ship then potentially you could get away too, and we're kind of thinking of some dynamics that would fall into the whole rationale behind whether we cap velocity at the low speeds, but we still allow you to reach much higher speeds when you're travelling between nav-points in space because in those cases you're just accelerating in a straight line. So we haven't fully figured all that out, but we're going to try to come up with some good ways, but also have it a way so you can't always run away from combat, because that wouldn't be that much fun for a bunch of other people. So again, a balance thing.", "published_at": "2014-01-24", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 06 (2014.01.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/NcRxuvQT3Ew", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Mae Linn", "published_at_timestamp": 1390598024}, {"objectID": "198bda18a4f52_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Will Star Citizen have Linux/Mac ports or just Windows only?", "answer": "It depends on Crytek and having the engine support OpenGL as well as DirectX.
