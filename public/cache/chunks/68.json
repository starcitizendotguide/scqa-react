Located at the outer edge of the system's habitable zone, microTech is mostly ice, with some cold-to-temperate areas of tundra. It was purchased from the UEE by the corporation microTech in the mid-2800s. Its capital, New Babbage, is home to many corporations and startups and is a major center for technological innovation.</p><br/><h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1><br/><p>Most of microTech is covered in mountains and ice sheets and subject to strong blizzards and ice storms. There are very few liquid bodies of water. Multiple temperate tundra zones exist in areas associated with deep geothermal activity. Camping expeditions and hikes in these greener biomes are popular vacation activities among microTech\u2019s full-time population. Cold-hardy plants such as evergreens, wildflowers, grasses, and lichen grow there throughout the year.</p><br/><p>Thawort, a lichen that grows on microTech and other worlds with arctic climates, is the subject of research for several pharmaceutical startups based in New Babbage. Its antiseptic and antibacterial properties have shown promise in the lab, though the properties are only present in wild-collected specimens. Research to replicate these traits in artificial conditions is ongoing. </p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>Discovered in 2851, Stanton IV is a super-Earth, and one of four planets in the Stanton system's habitable zone. Full development of the system would have taken funds not readily available to the government at the time. After beginning initial terraforming, the UEE announced the decision in 2865 to sell it and its sibling planets to private interests in order to help pay down its debts and provide a boost to the downturned economy.  </p><br/><p>An early terraforming error resulted in a climate far colder and harsher than initial projections had indicated, leading to multiple debates on the UEE Senate floor regarding the government's ability to sell Stanton IV. However, it was thanks to this error that founder and then-CEO of microTech Magnus Tobin purchased it as the new headquarters for microTech. Tobin sold off land his company had been using for server farms in the leadup to this acquisition. According to a contemporary press release, the \"reliably frigid\" climate of Stanton IV was ideal for keeping their expansive network of servers cool. Tobin personally oversaw the construction of New Babbage, the largest city and now-headquarters of microTech at large. </p><br/><h1>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</h1><br/><p>Planetary governance is conducted by specialized divisions of the microTech corporation. Population-sustaining departments such as water infrastructure and waste management exist alongside economic ones such as taxation, business licensing, and import/export. Former elected officials or government workers are typically hired for these roles, though those from the private-sector are not barred from selection. Upon their purchase of the planet, microTech upgraded their corporate security force to perform police actions where necessary. Wherever possible, microTech utilizes technology and custom microTech-designed systems and software to automate much of the day-to-day operations, including the enforcement of local laws. As immigration to microTech increases, leaders within microTech have debated the implementation of an eventual population cap. </p><br/><h1>CULTURE</h1><br/><p>The city of New Babbage was designed to support the creativity of the highly-skilled workforce needed to drive microTech's future innovation. Areas like the Commons were constructed as creative workspaces, dedicated to providing areas for programmers and engineers to relax, network, and plan. The city's robust nightlife provides an outlet for the workforce's high-pressure crunch times and higher-than-average salaries, and visiting financiers and venture capitalists make regular use of the high-end bars. Inhabitants also like to escape the confines of the city to take part in outdoor cold weather activities. </p><br/><p>Bleeding-edge technology is a common sight on microTech. Not only due to the company itself, but also the presence of other established tech companies alongside a constantly-cycling roster of startups. Residents who don't keep abreast of the latest advances are generally seen as gauche by their peers, though this outlook varies. Members of the upper-classes of the UEE frequent the markets to secure the newest tech before it officially debuts.", "id": "VYL46xl5Z1", "question": "What is microTech (Stanton IV)?", "slug": "microtech-stanton-iv", "template": "PlanetMoonSpaceStationPlatform", "title": "Galactapedia: microTech (Stanton IV)", "type": "galactapedia", "published_at": "2024-10-25", "published_at_timestamp": 1729823822}, {"objectID": "V8WpgA9rM1-min-1c", "answer": "Min 1c is the third moon from the rogue planet Min I in the unclaimed Min system.

I'm referring in particular to cloud movement, or something that hasn't been mentioned for a long time : the movement of stars?", "answer": "Yeah. Actually, on a technical level, we have game servers. These are the others that are part of the Mesh, the Server Mesh. We also have Replicants, which take care of networking. So at the moment in 4.0, we have a Replicant and then several Game servers that distribute the zones to each other. So the system is able to assign a server to a zone.<br/><br/>So we can make sure that wherever there are players, there's good performance, right? The further we get into implementing dynamic mesh, the more responsive it's going to be. So folks, if everyone goes off in an 890 jump, well, we're going to give the 890 jump a server. Okay, it's a bit silly, but that's it. That's what's cool, you know.<br/><br/>Now, there are other levels to this. There's what we call Star Services, which are game servers that aren't assigned to a shard, but take care of the overall universe. They run the game server, it's the same fundamental core of software, but they're only there to respond to calls for remote procedures to coordinate several shards together. So things like Dynamic Weather, for example, are something that can be put into a service and used by every shard.<br/><br/>Exactly. Everything that's VOIP is Voice Servers, everything that's social is the group manager and so on. So there are services like that. The entity graph, which handles all the game's persistence, are also services that are partly in the game server, but they're deployed as services that serve everything.<br/><br/>One of the big elements we're currently working on for 4.0, which is a hot feature, is the mission system. So, for example, the mission system in 3.23 or even 3.24, when you accept a mission or a contract, it creates a mission entity on the server. In fact, it's located at 0.0 of the universe! It's an invisible entity, obviously, that persists and follows you, but it's there. TODAY, you can't have that anymore! Because now 0,0 it's another server!<br/><br/>So now we're in the process of moving all mission systems, but into services that will be able to serve all shards. We're talking about Contract Broker, for example, which takes care of all your contracts that are available in your MobiGlass. There's also the Mission Factory, which takes care of creating missions in the game and coordinating the game servers, for example: if I have a delivery mission, we'll create an entity at the first location, and another entity at the drop location, and that'll make it possible to follow up.<br/><br/>The marker system has also been released. For example, something as simple as a party marker in another system... It's really hard to do in the old model. In the old model, you just put in a marker, but now with the new architecture, you have to have a service dedicated to that.<br/><br/>So there you have it, it's all about extracting what's in the current game server (PU) into services that will enable us to manage this more widely.", "published_at": "2024-10-20", "title": "Interview of Beno\u00eet Beaus\u00e9jour (CitCon 2954)", "source": "https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2280687172", "transcript": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1g9n68i/interview_with_beno%C3%AEt_beaus%C3%A9jour_at_citcon_2954/", "type": "twitch", "time": "4h50m38s", "published_at_timestamp": 1729425600}, {"objectID": "d8d7827281be5_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "For its initial release, the ATLS is invulnerable, but any bullets that hit the player will deal the same damage as they usually would.

There's  a lot of artist control over there and I think that's essential because we want people to come and have certain experiences on these planets.

You're going to have a tremendous amount of quantity in it and I think you're going to have so much that you're not going to see things repeat themselves: which is awesome.

The concept for the ship and the main base ship and everything that makes it up is based on the Manufacturer Style Guides. LODs are based on the actual geometry for the ship itself and the best way to optimise that down to a level where we can include it with all the other ships and maintain high performance.So LODs aren't really based on style guides. You might, you might try, you obviously want to keep the silhouette of the ship and keep it looking like, you don't want it to just look blocky. So if this ship has these nice curves along the edges you don't want the LODs to just block them out or chop them up, you want them to maintain that shape.Elwin Bachiller: Right. I mean what that does mean though for LODs there are some ship styles that are more difficult to deal with, because of that. So a very blocky ship, generally speaking a very blocky ship, would be easier to LOD because you wouldn't notice the changes in the surfaces as much as you would as a ship that's a little bit more rounded, so yeah. Style Guides don't affect it, but the Style Guide does, indirectly affect, how hard it is to make the LOD for it.PS: Correct.", "published_at": "2016-03-21", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 07", "source": "https://youtu.be/9otSsylG3OI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Amontillado", "published_at_timestamp": 1458597254}, {"objectID": "373682980", "answer": "Eric Kieron Davis: That's a good question. I think we learned a lot on the Constellation so this is I think this is V3 of the Constellation right? But we've talked about many other ship pipeline discussions. Every time you do this, you learn more about it, you get better at it, you build more to kitbash and build those faster, so I think this last one was great Josh coons and Chris Smith were leading the way on the Constellation and it looks gorgeous.We did a lot of work for it out here. Daniel Kaminsky did all that weeks and weeks of UV's that we needed, he did a great job and it made a really cool looking ship. I think we learned even more on this round that is going into the pipeline document that's massive and I think it may even be shared out at this point as it's a huge process. Then will iterations be made? We're making a game, this is creative world of course iterations will be made right? We're going to limit those iterations so we can keep making other content, but yeah you always want to go back and improve things and make things better right?Forrest Stephan: Right because I mean when we started and I was around when there were making the original constellation. The first time you build something, I mean that's almost your prototype, it's the first time you figure out how everything works. Then you kind of go and start improving it and figuring out well this doesn't work, well this works well and you start figuring out what your quality bar is and then you start getting all these assets and start figuring out in the game engine what your limitations are or how far you can actually push it.Then that's how you can really start defining your actual pipeline and defining okay, this is the quality that we can actually do, this is the amount of timeframe that we actually need to do this in and how can we improve the process to make sure that it  fits a production schedule. So the remodel of the constellation to me is the first time it was actually done once we figured out how we wanted to build ships.EKD: Yeah and I think the other part is the tech changes. The first prototype, that first one, tech was a certain way and may things may have not changed too much because the foundations there, but you improve. The same thing happens on the tech side as the art side. So when the tech changes then the art needs to change how that works and it's a constant back and forth.FS: and to answer the question, bottom turret, more in the middle of the screen. We learned a lot of things flying those ships. We learned it's really easy to make a cool looking cockpit, but then all of a sudden you don't have that field of view that you want. One thing that we realized right after those first set of ships is people want to be able to see space in their cockpit and the bigger the cockpit glass area, the better and that's one thing that was unanimous amongst fans. We were able to start removing things from the middle of the screen and started giving yourself a better view.EKD: To speak forwardly from the Constellation when we were doing the concept for the Crucible. We talked about it because it had that bar across the middle and were like \"Hey we've already done this,\" You know, let's find a better way...FS: And the character sits down you're like, bar is right in his view.EKD: Yeah, it's right in my eyes and the thing is Tony Zurovec called that out and we all were like you're right and it's just those constant reminders of improving.FS: And then how long, process to build out Constellation variants. So one thing about our variant is and building the ships is we realized we wanted to keep things very modular and reuse things and so instead of building one giant mesh, we built lots of little meshes that we piece together and and then we have these kits that we can pull from. So if you have a weapon rack it's not just a custom rack in a ship, it's a separate asset that was made and then it's placed into the ship so our ships were starting to build them much more modular, a lot of which we found was a huge advantage.When we do constellation variants we ask ourselves okay, \"How much of this ship is actually custom and what part of the ship is actually custom and what parts are already available\". SO because it's made by the same manufacture we'll be able to use kits that we've already made for these variants so it won't be 8-9 months to build a variant right? Because we're going to have the majority of it built and now that it's modular we'll be able to be like, \"Alright here's the head of the ship or here's the cockpit of the ship, lets swap that out.\" Which we've already seen with some of our ships we've been doing and have these different areas or variant will be different modular pieces that we've swapping in and out so the times are much faster.EKD: Totally, as far as exact time frames, we necessarily can't tell you for each ship what  the time frame for each of those, but it does dramatically get lower on variants, especially if there's less changes obviously right, less changes the faster we can get it done. They generally..FS: If they're custom.EKD: The more custom, the more we have to do to it. So generally faster, but not always the case so yeah with the Phoenix and with those we definitely want to get those out as fast as we can and I think we learned on the connie and we can take that onto the next variants, fo sho.", "published_at": "2016-01-19", "published_at_timestamp": 1453161882, "question": "With the recent remodel of the Constellation taking 8-9 months, can you discuss any process improvements that were made during that time and how long would a similar ship take now?

Now I do think what could happen is a player in a small mining ship, not even a big one like the orion because we've also been talking about doing smaller mining stuff, could get a contract from Shubin to start mining in an asteroid field and bring it back and they'll pay a certain amount for those minerals. You will get employed by NPC's corps well as player corps in the game, but whether you could be the security guard on a Shubin station.I don't think that's going to be something we're going to be implementing anytime soon.

I think I tried to explain the benefit, which is mostly to do with the fact that you're going to be playing and interacting with other players in multiplayer and they will be interacting with the world around you and the ship that you'll fly, and so therefore the interactions and actions you do with the environment is going to be visible from my view in first person with an other player playing a multiplayer, and I\"ll see him doing the stuff in third person, and I think I've pointed this out before but, typically when you play COD and you see all those wonderful first-person animations, where they open the hatch, and do all this stuff from first person, that's all specifically choreographed from first person. There is no third-person for that, and actually where the hand is and where the camera is is not really where the hand or the arms or the head or the eyes are of the actual character, and so it's fine when it's only from your point of view, but the moment that some other player's doing that from his point of view, and you're watching him do that, what will end up happening is his third person animation will have his head and arm and everything in a different position than it is to him in first person view which, normally if there isn't combat or something involved maybe it's okay, but if you have a lot of heavy interaction with environments and stuff, then it's going to be a problem and you can have things like, hey the arm in first person's up here, but in reality it's actually down here, so you've got collision issues where the collision proxies are in first and third person don't line up. They completely cheat in first person in most games. Most first person games, it's all faked, and that little center crosshair where you move is where they shoot, and if you actually went out to third person and looked at where your character is shooting, and where your bullets are going, you'd actually notice your bullets are not firing in a straight line from where your gun is pointing. They're probably at an angle, cause they're all being gravitated towards that center crosshair that you have in first person. And of course, again, we can't do that in our situation, cause I\"m a player, looking at another player, and you expect where his gun's pointing to be where he's going to fire. It's because we have a heavy amount of interactions between the environment outside of combat, and normally most first-person shooters, they really reduce the fidelity of the animation of other players vs. AI, and we really didn't want to do that. So that's the advantage is basically, where your hand is, where you're looking, it's consistent between first and third person. You don't have to cheat, you don't have to do special fix-ups because you're in first-person vs. third person, and vice-versa. So, long-term, if you get the base stuff to work, it makes your life a hell of a lot easier, which, for us, is pretty important because we have a massive massive massive game, and so we have massive amounts of animations, so if we have to do both first person and third person animation for all the motion sets, it's... insane. We're already thousands and thousands of animation assets, and we don't really want to double up on them. And again, in a normal FPS, you don't really have that same issue, because you're not doing something that has a variety of number of ships you can enter, the number of things you can interact, and you're not really thinking about how you're going to be building this thing over 10 years, and have you doing all these different things, and we do, so trying to simplify it to not have two parallel systems is something that, I think, long-term, definitely important. Short term, makes it hard, because most people who've worked on first person stuff, and tried to unify first and third person, will say it was a bitch, and they normally give up and cheat. So, maybe I'm just really stubborn, which is probably true, it also means I make decent games because I don't give up until I get it right. But I think long-term it's the right call.

It's not about the landing, it's about the exhilaration of the experience and that's where we can add in from a lore perspective and also...It's this really interesting triangle of development as far as kind of this in-progress works which kind of makes it a really fun project to be on where design, art, and narrative are all working... and it can start at any one of those points.

So, it kind of all feeds into each other and it can start anywhere and it's really that kind of organic creative process.AW: Yeah, it's nice to have people from other departments walk into our office and be like, \"Hey, we had a great idea!\" and kind of be able to hear that and... \"That will be perfect to incorporate in or play around with.\" So, it's good to have ideas coming from all different directions.", "published_at": "2015-06-01", "title": "10 For the Writers Episode 03", "source": "https://youtu.be/SGHW2e8BCm4", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Kommadore", "published_at_timestamp": 1433196471}, {"objectID": "1920027a8e05a2_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "This change occurred when we received the new, more detailed model to measure.

Basically, I'll call someone over and say, does this look like trash, does it look amazing, what do you think.  I may love it, and someone else'll be like, that totally doesn't work, and I\"ll be like, well, why doesn't it work?  And I'll do it to them.  So, you do it to me all the time.Lance Powell: The big thing is it's a team effort.  You know, people are kind of tired of hearing this, but you know, there's no I in Team, and the reality is, the artist in me wants to own a thing.  But not everyone's strong at everything, except for ElwinEB: [shakes head]LP: But, the idea is, you do want to play guys to their strengths.  And, you don't want to be the case all the time, ultimately you want everyone to have the same set of strengths, but given that production, that rarely ever happens, we start spreading people around and making sure that what's getting the attention is the ship, which is what the priority is on, and not necessarily the individual.  So that individual brings their best to that particular thing, and if it can't close out with that artist, we'll close it out with someone else on the team.", "published_at": "2015-04-28", "title": "10 for the Artists: Episode 01 (2015.04.28)", "source": "https://youtu.be/mODLgO4DgwY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Cyberwolf", "published_at_timestamp": 1430219413}, {"objectID": "373676130", "question": "Will I be able to search other players for weapons before they board my ship?

I don't think it would be that particularly hard to do and I think we would want that as a mechanic &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; that someone could scan someone and see if they have a weapon or not and say that you're only allowed on if you don't have a weapon. That would probably be a functionality we would want to put in the FPS module. We already have some other kind of functionality which includes scanning and looting off people and stuff like that, so I think that would be something that I think we would add to that.

It's kinda interesting because in the engine right now we allow you to switch between first and third person, mainly because we really think the ships look great and the characters look great, and we like to show off the cool graphics. The focus has been, you know, if you want to be in combat, doing action, you want to be in first person because you get all this extra information via your HUD and all the rest of the stuff you would get. And the same would go in first person combat, like if you're in a combat suit you will get a HUD in your visor, and of course if you were in third person you wouldn't get that and it would be much harder to aim, etc, etc.So I think I'm sort of leaning towards that direction so can admire you avatar and what clothes he's wearing and stuff like that. But we definitely want to make sure if you switch to third person you're not getting a tactical advantage. Really for aiming and shooting, both flying your ship and on foot, needs to be in first person.", "published_at": "2014-07-14", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 29.

I'm wondering, are those maps representative of what the PU will look and feel like, with all the rocks and debris?Or will there also be large spans of open space that we need to cross to get from point A to point B? It seems like the best way to show how big the universe is would be to have a lot of nothing.", "answer": "Yes, in the Persistent Universe, the Arena Commander maps are a sort of smaller scale map.So there's one big technical move we haven't done yet in the engine, which we're in the process of getting ready to do and be doing some early work on. Which is moving from single precision floating point to double precision floating point.Single precision floating point, once you get beyond about 8-10 km from the origin, you start to have some precision problems in small distances, like under a meter. In double precision you don't, 'cause it's obviously a much larger range.Our goal is to have a system map be one unified map, so it's not split up and the address, space, in the system is the same from one side to the other side, and that will come with the double precision. In that case, what's gonna happen is you're going to have large areas of not really a lot, and then you'll have clumps of detail like the asteroid field and the stuff that you see in Broken Moon or Dying Star.So it will be a combination of nothing and high levels of detail, with some beautiful backgrounds.There you go, and it will be much bigger. I mean we're talking about we won't go fully accurate, 'cause that's getting really big and would be boring, but we're looking at our system sizes to be +/- 1 million km verses +/- 8-10 km.", "published_at": "2014-06-23", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 26.

We're always appraised and looking at their newest stuff even some stuff that they haven't released generally to the public or shown. We have a really nice position. We sort of openly share stuff. We'll give them some of the stuff that we do, back their way, and of course we're taking their upgrades to the engine.Double precision I don't know. We haven't had that specific discussion. It is a pretty big change because the whole engine works in 32 bit, not double, and there's a fair amount of things that have to change for that. So I'm not sure they would necessarily want to take that back into their standard engine because double precision really is needed for a big space game, but not necessarily for a first person game.

John Erskin who's head of all out online operations and digital publishing works closely with Turbulent and together they've been working with Jason Spangler, our CTO, on our digital platform.We're always looking at various ways to increase our security, and thinking ahead of the game.

We've been lucky, we really haven't had much of that so far, but as you become bigger, it always happens.Luckily we've got some people who have had experience at that. John actually came to us from NC Soft, and before that he was at Origin where he was working on Ultima Online, so he's actually had a lot of big online MMO experience.So we're thinking about it, we don't have anything firm to say yet, but that's definitely in our plans.", "published_at": "2014-04-03", "title": "10 for the Chairman - Episode 14 .
