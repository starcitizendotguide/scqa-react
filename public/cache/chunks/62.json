Both for Star Citizen and Squadron are female and male, so it's 100% part of our development plan. It's just that in the early stages, the concept is to not have to be revising assets, that we do it with one skeleton, which is the male skeleton at the moment, and then we determine exactly what animations, motion sets we want, because even though we've done all this performance capture, there's still a lot of stuff where you're working on the AI, for instance, the combat AI, or you're saying, oh, I need an animation to slide in to cover a certain way. Oh, well that one doesn't work. Let's change it to work this way. And so there's a lot of iteration, especially on the combat animations that you do for the players and also the AI. So from our standpoint, we don't want to have two skeletons that then we have to fix up two of the animations. So we work it on one skeleton until we lock all the animation sets that we know we need for the player and the AI, and then we just make sure that we create the other skeleton's animation set. So definitely you'll be able to play as a female or as a male, you'll be able to customise how your character looks in Squadron, it will carry across into the PU, so you'll be able to carry your character across from Squadron into the PU, and so there you go, yes.", "title": "Star Citizen: Reverse the Verse LIVE - Squadron 42 Q&A", "source": "https://youtu.be/fS6FpCpt5m4", "type": "youtube", "published_at_timestamp": 1517055120}, {"objectID": "1029923592", "question": "Since you adopted CryEngine 3 before the free-license change, did the move to Lumberyard and its royalty free model, mean it was a cost saving for Cloud Imperium?", "answer": "Well you can\u2019t get better value than free, of course!

Perhaps on remote moons with massive warehouses full of wares for the less legal citizens among us.

You\u2019ll be able to take items, just I want to hold 500 million bars of soap because I want to be the owner of all the soap in the universe. If you can afford them, that to buy it and if you can afford the storage space because renting a storage space will cost money, the bigger the storage space, the more money it will cost; If you can afford to do that, yes you\u2019ll be able to do that. You will not be able to break the company because we are the not the 100% player driven economy where it\u2019s an economy that we control and the NPCs have a very heavy stake in it. You\u2019re just one person in the universe, this gigantic universe with billions and billions of people, they will have  a say in it, so if you start buying all the soap in the universe cause you want to hoard it there\u2019ll be a lot of companies going \u2018I\u2019ll start producing soap now\u2019 and they\u2019ll put more soap on the market, so it\u2019ll be very very hard to crash the market. \n\n-Same manufacturers maybe?- \n\nYes, we\u2019re kinda thinking of standardizing them beyond manufacturing, \nbecause it would be weird if you have an RSI ship, he has a drake ship, \nyou\u2019ll never be able to dock with each other just because it\u2019s a \ndifferent manufacturer. I mean, we're thinking a few hundred years in \nthe future, even now everything gets standardize. People would \nstandardize a docking ring so they know, oh, we\u2019re a class A docking \nring or class B, so we\u2019re definitely going to do this. As to release, if\n it all gets released as one or not, that will have to see, probably it \nwill be in stages as with everything we do. It\u2019s easier for us cause we \nrelease a small part, see how it works, then we adjust, and then adjust \nalso what hasn\u2019t been released, and keep making better and better rather\n than giving everything at once and then we have to do a big chunk of \nrework. \n\n--So you\u2019re talking about class A and B docking ports, is that something \nthat you\u2019re looking at right now, to name it like that? Class A and \nclass B?--\n\n\n\nNo, it\u2019s just an example, they don\u2019t have definite names right now, but \nthey will be, it might be that the docking port becomes a component of \nit, but we\u2019re still looking into this, because it would be weird if that\n docking port is always there on some ships, if people don\u2019t need it, so\n then it might become a component, it might not, it depends on, we\u2019ll \nsee how this works in gameplay, so lots of experimentation. Because if I\n can put the docking port there, or I can put something else instead of \nthe docking port that benefits me more cause I never want to dock with \npeople, maybe that\u2019s a better way.

The issue with being able to do that is one,  A: CryEngine is not very good at having proper multi camera views. So in terms of having a camera here and a camera over here, it doesn't really support that. Also, by the way, just to let you know on a rendering time, you just doubled your rendering time basically because you render one view and you render a second view.I think short term we're not gonna have sort of secondary camera views. Longer term it's always something we kind of like although there is some fundamental structure inside CryEngine that isn't very predisposed to it that may go away to some extent as we continue to refactor the engine, but right now that isn't in the short term road map.The other possibility and opportunity that we've talked about is potentially, which is not exactly the same, but we talked about viewer clients that you can basically log into the server and see a camera or control a camera so think of it like a traffic camera or something and so you can have a different view.Potentially, maybe something like that could help out a little bit there, but at the moment we're not planning on having that functionality right now.

And in theory making those animations emotes isn't really too difficult of a thing. We have a lot of eating, we have a lot of drinking. You're going to be able to go a lot of places like nightclubs, and there'll be waitresses there and bartenders and bouncers. We shot motion capture for people selling spaceships and stuff like that, like at a car dealership or things like that.The challenging thing is the design side of this: getting this to play well together and having a connection between the animation. So for the AI we can control the things that we want them to do, when we want them to do it, and how we want them to do it. But for Players it's really kind of restricting. So anything that we create as emotes however you could essentially use as jobs so we have an aircraft marshal ... guy that sort of goes like this [hand gestures] ... kind of like, almost like a work out right?Sean Tracy: Yeah it's almost like a work out!SB: But if we create them as emotes you could actually turn yourself into an aircraft marshal without it being an official job.

So all of our ship masses at the moment are rough estimates based on typically the general bounds the ship takes up so its volume we don't currently have solid metrics for the actual physical space therefore the mass would be represented in a ship there's also material density that we haven't quite figured out yet that is coming down the pipe but until then it's currently all eye balled so hopefully in the future we'll be able to get more concrete metrics for all of these masses and densities and what not to determine more realistic values of ships this will be especially important when balanced and especially cargo come online.Cargo itself is going to take up space and mass and they will change the flight characteristics when you're laden with a bunch of cargo especially on ships that can take massive amounts of cargo such as the Constellation. Huge cargo bay when it's full of really massive boxes of stuff the flight characteristics will change. How will they change? That's what we are determining now. That will come some day soon and when we figure that out I think we'll have a little bit more realistic values for all the masses of the ships.Randy Vasquez: One of the things you mentioned was the Constellation and one of the things is whenever we get cargo up and running and that adds extra weight and mass. The center of mass changes on the ships, the thrusters will have to be smart enough to adjust and then again going back to asymmetrical ships like Caterpillar we had talked about all the cargo would be in the front of the ship and all the fuel and everything else is in the back of the ship so when it's empty the center of mass is actually closer to engineering but then when all the cargo is there the center of mass changes by a good ten meters so it's going to be extra work to get that on board.KT: True once all the stuff is working it will help us to better design interchangeable thrusters so maybe you do need thrusters that have slightly slower attack but are able to move more mass efficiently especially across those long stretches of space that will encompass the PU gameplay for moving tons of cargo.RV: Cargo's going to be very encompassing for all the stuff we have like mining salvaging and repairing and all that.KT: Yep!", "published_at_timestamp": 1444686758, "question": "There seems to be a disparity in ship weights compared to what it's represented in the model and xml values...ie...A ship that is big on the exterior, but that is mostly hollow in the inside... but it weighs as much as it looks like on the outside. And ships that are smaller and touted to have armor ...obviously solid or densely packed that weigh less than slightly bigger hollow ship. Is there going to be a standard metric to determining ship weights based on the volume the ship takes up and possible list of materials the ship would be made of?", "source": "https://youtu.be/pigtF3Xxjfg", "title": "10 for the Designers: Episode 06", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "MtOjebogi", "time": "18m11s"}, {"objectID": "185247b2d16896_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Cargo pods from the Hull are standardized and can be stored aboard the Endeavor.

Enter alliances that give some kind of bonus or benefits? And could an entire org become blacklisted by law enforcement groups like the uee advocacy, similar to how in real life a person can be arrested for being involved with a known criminal organization like a gang,syndicate or violent extremist group?", "answer": "So yes definitely you'll be able to engage in guild wars, infact i'm pretty confident there will be guild wars considering the amount of different organizations I've seen that we have and the fact that a few of them are diametrically opposed to each other. We are building three levels of gameplay that we're focusing on, one is sort of solo gameplay, which is more atin to the privateer, freelancer game where you can do your own stuff, you could potentially do work for bigger organizations or other people. Then we've got the sort of group of friends setup so think of that like a raiding party or something in world of warcraft, you and three or four of your friends are flying a constellation and you're going off on missions and then we have the big level organization stuff where we're deliberately going to have some areas that the organizations would want to fight over or control or own and that would involve lots of people not just three or 4 people. You know, hundreds of people, maybe not all hundreds in the exact same instance at the same time but you know a bigger scale conflict where people are bringing bigger ships to the fight and working with various fighters and medium sized ships and cap sized ships, combined arms and all that kind of stuff, so we're trying to create that level of gameplay and I think it would be cool, also I think that if an organization sort of persists attacking sort of the institutions where it's the UEE or whatever then yes at that point the organization would be the enemy of the state and will have AI, say advocacy members come after that organization if they know or can detect them. and there's that organization, so we haven't finalized the reputation system that would go with that and how that gets transmitted or broadcast and how you can spoof that or hide it from people, but that would all be sort of plugged into that and I think it should make it a pretty interesting game dynamic and we'll see what happens. I know we have plenty of pirate orgs for instance, they will probably be on the other side of the law. So there you go!

What would you will like to see (or see more of) the the general community creating for Star Citizen?", "answer": "Well, to be honest with you I don't think I've seen anything I haven't liked. I'm pretty impressed by the amount of stuff that everyone does, so, just the level of like fiction that people write, things like doing their own comic strips, the sort of machinima stuff that's been pretty awesome, and there's some really great stuff that various people out there have been doing. You know, doing videos showing off the game, showing off features, that's all super cool. It's really cool seeing people build their own 3D printed ships of our ships, it's very cool people building their own sort of spaceship models and components and guns... the next great starship was something that we tried to highlight a while ago, and I'd like to try to get back to, but I'm just constantly floored by the sort of investment the community has in sort of building the world up, and that's always the things I like best, is all the sort of in-fiction stuff, so, we get great recruitment posters for the UEE navy and all that stuff is super super cool. I will say that, long-term goal is to actually have more, try and get some tools in there for some of the community generated content, cause right now it's really the people that kind of know CryEngine and they know how to strip the assets out of our builds and they use it, and there was a group of modders already built their own version of Pirate Swarm, which was pretty cool. But what I'd like to do is have proper tools so, a longer term thing would be to provide some tools to allow people to do some of that inside the game in a more formal setting. Obviously, that's... certain things we need to get out first, but that's actually something that I'm pretty keen on because I think, at the end of the day, there's a lot of creativity out there, and it's hard for us to keep up with how much everyone out there wants to consume stuff, so it'd be fun and helpful to have some of you guys out there being able to also generate some stuff that people could enjoy and play. So that will be a sort of longer-term focus for us.

For the first release it's all human, UEE weapons. As we move forward we'll begin introducing new weapon manufacturers. We want the manufacturers of the weapons to be as distinctive as the ships, both in their designs and their function. And, so as we develop out these manufacturers and we give them a wider kit of weapons - we'll get a little more background on them, some lore on them - and we'll start incorporating things, like you have with Musashi Industrial & Starflight Concern, where they have elements of Xi'An technology or elements of Banu technology. So, it's just a matter of working out the lore, working out the designs both from a creative design standpoint and also a gameplay design standpoint... but once we get there, yeah! It's absolutely something we'd love to do.

We don't have an Open GL .dll driver at the moment, crytek was working on one, but they haven't managed to get it to a state where anyone is happy with the performance being acceptable. It's also the reason we've not got working versions for mac. Longer term we're looking at openGL next and having conversations with various parties about supporting OpenGLNext such as AMD on the graphics card side. That's something we're looking at along with DX12, so OpenGLNext would allow us to consider things like Linux support as I'm sure they'll move to OpenGLNext too. And of course if CryTek manages to get their implementation of the current OpenGL working we'll look at it too. That's really what's been blocking us for the moment.

One of the biggest concerns the lack of a jump drive on the known dedicated racing ships. With racing taking place in multiple systems across the verse in the PU how will the M50, Mustang, and 350R owners get their racer from one system to another?", "answer": "Okay, well, so certain things - the 350r definitely will be able to have a jump drive... the Mustang also, like the Aurora, would be able to have sort of an upgraded jump drive. The M50 is pretty small, so it's likely not necessarily to have a jump drive. But we're gonna also have-... you know, that's kinda the idea of why you'd have bigger ships. So if you think about racing in today's world of people who go around racing, they have big 18-wheelers that they put their race cars in the back, and drive around the country. Or even in the case of high-end stuff like Formula 1 they put them on planes and fly them around. So we'll definitely have transporter ships that you'll be able to take your smaller, something like an M50, in. For instance if you have an 890 JUMP and you're cruising around in style in the universe, you could have an M50 sitting in the cargo bay and race it in various races... you know... just like the super rich do in today's world!So, we'll definitely have ships that can transport them around, or if you didn't have a ship that you want to do that you could probably hire someone to transport your ship to the next race location.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 36 (2014.09.08)", "source": "https://youtu.be/a7GBgc4GxAQ", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Azazel", "published_at_timestamp": 1410213823}, {"objectID": "373679410", "question": "How important is it to you that this game sets a visual standard for modern games? Will you try to make the graphics advanced enough to test enthusiast PCs in 2015?", "answer": "Yes! I will! Heheh... no, it's really important for me. I mean I think if you know the games I did in the past - you know, Wing Commander onwards - they were always trying to set a visual bar, and sometimes they probably went beyond what most of the machines could do at the time. Strike Commander is a pretty good example of one that, on a 486 66MHz it was a pretty amazing experience, but if you didn't have something like that then frame rate wasn't so great and all the rest of the stuff. But it was the very first PC game that had real-time proper 3D texture mapping, Gouraud shading... so it had a whole bunch of stuff that didn't show up in other games in the PC gaming world until quite a few years later. And that was mainly because we were sort of pushing it, and we read up a whole bunch of white papers from places like SIGGRAPH and tried to adapt that into the old days of software rendering - which luckily we don't have to deal with now with all the hardware rendering.But yes, so I'm very keep on pushing it. One of the reasons why I picked CryEngine was that it's visually a very advanced engine. CryEngine is the engine which did Crysis 1, which I think probably to this day is still sort the game you would think about that pushed the PC hardware platform, and was probably the last one that really had that ambition. I really would like Star Citizen to continue doing that. So CryEngine was a good base but we actually have a fair amount of graphics engineers and some core engine people, so besides the stuff we get from Crytek which actually trying to do some really cool stuff ourselves and enhance it, and we will continue to try and push it. So whatever is available in 2015, and beyond (2016, etc) we will always be trying to upgrade the visuals and push it. You can sort of see it as the game goes along. The Hornet has now been through 3 iterations; so there was the iteration from my original prototype that I showed in 2012, then we did an up-res of it for it's first debut in the hangar, and then we did yet another up-res of it for the dogfighting module, where it got fully PBRed and stuff. And you've seen the 300i get an up-res from it's hangar version, and we're doing similar stuff for the Constellation, and the Aurora, and a bunch of the other ships. So we're always constantly trying to look to push it and make it better, and I think that's one of the reasons why you guys are excited by Star Citizen.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 32 (2014.08.04)", "source": "https://youtu.be/NM0DVz1VcvY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Socrates", "published_at_timestamp": 1407189612}, {"objectID": "373683370", "question": "My question has to do with electronic warfare.

Potentially trying to hack or invade the other person's ship. So we're actually actively looking at doing that, and we'll probably have some of that involved in info running and the Drake Herald stuff. And we're certainly going to have more brute force stuff like EMF and all that kinda stuff.

And then we've got some other things that we're thinking about, we're had a lot about Murray Cup racing, and we've been focusing. We've got some races and we want to do a race course.We'll probably release something with Arena Commander, not v1.0, but just after that we'll have some timed racing courses and stuff that you can fly your ships in, which I think will be pretty cool. And yeah, both those things could be very suited to that e-sports set up. I think what we would probably do 'cause we always like to do everything in-fiction is to sort of have the e-sports part of it almost feel in-fiction.So if you're competing to be the best dogfighter or you're competing to be the fastest racer, you're really competing in the Murray Cup in our universe. You're competing in some big, fictional, invitational tournament or whatever for the dogfighting. We'll sort of do e-sports in our universe. Kind of like Inception one level inside something else.But yes, we think that would be fun, we're also going to do a certain amount of support for people to watch stuff, so not right away, but we're looking at ways that we can have sort of windows onto action, so you can maybe log in to the website and see some cool battle happening out in space, and definitely if we have a competition or e-sports scene we would figure out ways to broadcast the combat or ways to broadcast the racing, and maybe once the Persistent Universe is up and running, you could even be in a bar in the persistent universe looking at a TV and see basically our Twitch broadcast of that which you could also see direct on our website.Hopefully that sounds cool, that's kind of what we're thinking about.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 22.
