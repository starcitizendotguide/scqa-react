When injected intravenously, it causes immediate pain relief, greatly lessens anxiety, and triggers a feeling of euphoria. However, repeated use can lead to collapsed veins, liver and kidney disease, heart conditions, and myriad other health issues.</p><br/><h1>ORIGIN</h1><br/><p>In SEY 2861, the discovery of the Oso system brought government survey teams to Oso II. Before the detection of the Osoians made travel to Oso II forbidden under the Fair Chance Act, the teams collected a handful of unique native plant samples. One of these, named \"nightspiral\" for the multicolored swirls on its flowers, struggled to adapt to conditions outside of Oso II. Scientists crossbred the plant using grafting and genetic modification until they created a stable hybrid that produced seeds containing alkaloids. They conducted investigations into the seeds' potential medical applications and intoxicating effects, but their reports were classified. </p><br/><p>It is unclear how the seeds made their way out of the lab, but in 2867 a new injectable drug called NightNight appeared on the market. Derived from the nightspiral seeds, it produced a calming and euphoric effect and was sold under the promise that it was not addictive. Demand skyrocketed, but the prohibitive cost of NightNight's manufacture due to the challenges associated with rearing the nightspiral plant kept supply low. Evidence collected by the Advocacy suggests that underground chemists began to iterate on the drug's recipe, eventually reaching a low-cost, purely synthetic version in 2879. </p><br/><h1>SPREAD</h1><br/><p>This new formula, sold under the ironic name \"white diawirline\" or \"WDW,\" rapidly spread throughout the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Users who sought NightNight were offered WDW instead, or were sometimes sold WDW being passed off as genuine NightNight. This tactic hooked more users than might have otherwise fallen under the drug's thrall and guaranteed continual sales for the dealer.</p><br/><p>In 2880, WDW made headlines when socialite Khali O'Brien went through sudden, extreme weight loss and black veins appeared on her neck. Friends of O'Brien leaked stories to the press about her plight, and paparazzi began to incessantly tail her. After layers of concealer failed to hide the web-like patterns on her neck and O'Brien took to wearing black turtlenecks and scarves, one gossip columnist nicknamed her the \"Black Widow.\" The name soon stuck to the drug itself, and government officials formally classified it as WiDoW. </p><br/><h1>MITIGATION</h1><br/><p>The UEE has declared WiDoW use as \"one of the most significant public health issues of the 30th century.\" Billions of UEC have been poured into information campaigns, rehab facilities, addiction counseling, and more, but overall fatality rates among its users have not dropped. The Advocacy runs frequent crackdowns on known makers of WiDoW and offers rewards for bringing dealers to justice. They also arrest users, which credentialed substance abuse counselors and social workers say only makes the lives of these users worse and often ensures that they will not seek help.

If you can afford them, that to buy it and if you can afford the storage space because renting a storage space will cost money, the bigger the storage space, the more money it will cost; If you can afford to do that, yes you\u2019ll be able to do that. You will not be able to break the company because we are the not the 100% player driven economy where it\u2019s an economy that we control and the NPCs have a very heavy stake in it. You\u2019re just one person in the universe, this gigantic universe with billions and billions of people, they will have  a say in it, so if you start buying all the soap in the universe cause you want to hoard it there\u2019ll be a lot of companies going \u2018I\u2019ll start producing soap now\u2019 and they\u2019ll put more soap on the market, so it\u2019ll be very very hard to crash the market. \n\n-Same manufacturers maybe?- \n\nYes, we\u2019re kinda thinking of standardizing them beyond manufacturing, \nbecause it would be weird if you have an RSI ship, he has a drake ship, \nyou\u2019ll never be able to dock with each other just because it\u2019s a \ndifferent manufacturer. I mean, we're thinking a few hundred years in \nthe future, even now everything gets standardize. People would \nstandardize a docking ring so they know, oh, we\u2019re a class A docking \nring or class B, so we\u2019re definitely going to do this. As to release, if\n it all gets released as one or not, that will have to see, probably it \nwill be in stages as with everything we do. It\u2019s easier for us cause we \nrelease a small part, see how it works, then we adjust, and then adjust \nalso what hasn\u2019t been released, and keep making better and better rather\n than giving everything at once and then we have to do a big chunk of \nrework. \n\n--So you\u2019re talking about class A and B docking ports, is that something \nthat you\u2019re looking at right now, to name it like that? Class A and \nclass B?--\n\n\n\nNo, it\u2019s just an example, they don\u2019t have definite names right now, but \nthey will be, it might be that the docking port becomes a component of \nit, but we\u2019re still looking into this, because it would be weird if that\n docking port is always there on some ships, if people don\u2019t need it, so\n then it might become a component, it might not, it depends on, we\u2019ll \nsee how this works in gameplay, so lots of experimentation. Because if I\n can put the docking port there, or I can put something else instead of \nthe docking port that benefits me more cause I never want to dock with \npeople, maybe that\u2019s a better way.

Longer term it's always something we kind of like although there is some fundamental structure inside CryEngine that isn't very predisposed to it that may go away to some extent as we continue to refactor the engine, but right now that isn't in the short term road map.The other possibility and opportunity that we've talked about is potentially, which is not exactly the same, but we talked about viewer clients that you can basically log into the server and see a camera or control a camera so think of it like a traffic camera or something and so you can have a different view.Potentially, maybe something like that could help out a little bit there, but at the moment we're not planning on having that functionality right now. I do agree it would be cool, it's more about the core fundamental structure of the engine which doesn't support multiple cameras.

Amontillado \"Hi guys we're aware that the characters will be able to pull others out of the line of fire during combat but will our characters be able to interact with each other in other circumstances such as pushing, pulling, restraining and hugging?\" So these two things are basically ... the answer to these is kind of similar.So in Star Citizen and in the Persistent Universe you're going to start seeing detailed animations for aircraft carrier launches and things like that. And in theory making those animations emotes isn't really too difficult of a thing. We have a lot of eating, we have a lot of drinking. You're going to be able to go a lot of places like nightclubs, and there'll be waitresses there and bartenders and bouncers. We shot motion capture for people selling spaceships and stuff like that, like at a car dealership or things like that.The challenging thing is the design side of this: getting this to play well together and having a connection between the animation. So for the AI we can control the things that we want them to do, when we want them to do it, and how we want them to do it. But for Players it's really kind of restricting. So anything that we create as emotes however you could essentially use as jobs so we have an aircraft marshal ... guy that sort of goes like this [hand gestures] ... kind of like, almost like a work out right?Sean Tracy: Yeah it's almost like a work out!SB: But if we create them as emotes you could actually turn yourself into an aircraft marshal without it being an official job. You can just go out on the tarmac and start start directing traffic. And stuff like that.ST: I think guys do that already. Totally!SB: The other problem though with some of these actions, like the bartending and things like that are things ... it's about interacting with other players. The tricky thing here is even though you can do something it's about the acceptance of the other player. So if I want to make out with Sean Tracy [Sean is shaking his head] he has to accept that offer otherwise I'm going to end up back in the HR office again. So the same thing is true ...ST: It's only because you're using tongue. It's okay if it's not with tongue.SB: [laughs] Well you heard it hear folks!ST: No, it's not okay even without tongue.SB: So ... yeah ...

May be the question is revolving around if I sit down for a session, how long is that session? Is it five minutes, thirty minutes, an hour, five hours?In terms of play I think we would design missions, or things that you can do, to be thirty minutes to an hour of sort of game time and then it's up to you. I mean I don't think you can get in for five minutes do much that's meaningful. I think it's a minimum of thirty minutes but I think you should be able to do missions or get stuff done in thirty minutes to an hour and then it's up to you about how much stuff you want to get done. It all depends. There could be some stuff that's fairly quick and there's obviously some stuff, like if you are delivering cargo from one side of the universe to the other one, which will be more of a commitment. You don't have to do it all in one play session, you could be jumping your way across the galaxy getting out of scrapes with pirates, or whatever, landing on a planet, saving it and then coming the next day and continuing the journey.We're not particularly metric driven \"oh, it needs to be a five minute play session or a thirty minute play sessions\" which I know that on mobile people are very focused on \"well they have to get something out of it in five minutes\" but for us I think it is at least thirty minutes to an hour, and more obviously, would be the minimum time we think that if you just get in, get your stuff sorted, go out in space and do something it will take you.", "published_at": "2015-12-21", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 73", "source": "https://youtu.be/MHLwAuM1J8c", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Voidhunter", "published_at_timestamp": 1450739049, "time": "21m25s"}, {"objectID": "373675270", "answer": "Kirk Tome: Great question and i'm going to be honest with you this is all currently a guess. So all of our ship masses at the moment are rough estimates based on typically the general bounds the ship takes up so its volume we don't currently have solid metrics for the actual physical space therefore the mass would be represented in a ship there's also material density that we haven't quite figured out yet that is coming down the pipe but until then it's currently all eye balled so hopefully in the future we'll be able to get more concrete metrics for all of these masses and densities and what not to determine more realistic values of ships this will be especially important when balanced and especially cargo come online.Cargo itself is going to take up space and mass and they will change the flight characteristics when you're laden with a bunch of cargo especially on ships that can take massive amounts of cargo such as the Constellation. Huge cargo bay when it's full of really massive boxes of stuff the flight characteristics will change. How will they change? That's what we are determining now. That will come some day soon and when we figure that out I think we'll have a little bit more realistic values for all the masses of the ships.Randy Vasquez: One of the things you mentioned was the Constellation and one of the things is whenever we get cargo up and running and that adds extra weight and mass. The center of mass changes on the ships, the thrusters will have to be smart enough to adjust and then again going back to asymmetrical ships like Caterpillar we had talked about all the cargo would be in the front of the ship and all the fuel and everything else is in the back of the ship so when it's empty the center of mass is actually closer to engineering but then when all the cargo is there the center of mass changes by a good ten meters so it's going to be extra work to get that on board.KT: True once all the stuff is working it will help us to better design interchangeable thrusters so maybe you do need thrusters that have slightly slower attack but are able to move more mass efficiently especially across those long stretches of space that will encompass the PU gameplay for moving tons of cargo.RV: Cargo's going to be very encompassing for all the stuff we have like mining salvaging and repairing and all that.KT: Yep!", "published_at": "2015-10-12", "published_at_timestamp": 1444686758, "question": "There seems to be a disparity in ship weights compared to what it's represented in the model and xml values...ie...A ship that is big on the exterior, but that is mostly hollow in the inside... but it weighs as much as it looks like on the outside.

We are building three levels of gameplay that we're focusing on, one is sort of solo gameplay, which is more atin to the privateer, freelancer game where you can do your own stuff, you could potentially do work for bigger organizations or other people. Then we've got the sort of group of friends setup so think of that like a raiding party or something in world of warcraft, you and three or four of your friends are flying a constellation and you're going off on missions and then we have the big level organization stuff where we're deliberately going to have some areas that the organizations would want to fight over or control or own and that would involve lots of people not just three or 4 people. You know, hundreds of people, maybe not all hundreds in the exact same instance at the same time but you know a bigger scale conflict where people are bringing bigger ships to the fight and working with various fighters and medium sized ships and cap sized ships, combined arms and all that kind of stuff, so we're trying to create that level of gameplay and I think it would be cool, also I think that if an organization sort of persists attacking sort of the institutions where it's the UEE or whatever then yes at that point the organization would be the enemy of the state and will have AI, say advocacy members come after that organization if they know or can detect them. and there's that organization, so we haven't finalized the reputation system that would go with that and how that gets transmitted or broadcast and how you can spoof that or hide it from people, but that would all be sort of plugged into that and I think it should make it a pretty interesting game dynamic and we'll see what happens. I know we have plenty of pirate orgs for instance, they will probably be on the other side of the law. So there you go!

I'm pretty impressed by the amount of stuff that everyone does, so, just the level of like fiction that people write, things like doing their own comic strips, the sort of machinima stuff that's been pretty awesome, and there's some really great stuff that various people out there have been doing. You know, doing videos showing off the game, showing off features, that's all super cool. It's really cool seeing people build their own 3D printed ships of our ships, it's very cool people building their own sort of spaceship models and components and guns... the next great starship was something that we tried to highlight a while ago, and I'd like to try to get back to, but I'm just constantly floored by the sort of investment the community has in sort of building the world up, and that's always the things I like best, is all the sort of in-fiction stuff, so, we get great recruitment posters for the UEE navy and all that stuff is super super cool. I will say that, long-term goal is to actually have more, try and get some tools in there for some of the community generated content, cause right now it's really the people that kind of know CryEngine and they know how to strip the assets out of our builds and they use it, and there was a group of modders already built their own version of Pirate Swarm, which was pretty cool. But what I'd like to do is have proper tools so, a longer term thing would be to provide some tools to allow people to do some of that inside the game in a more formal setting. Obviously, that's... certain things we need to get out first, but that's actually something that I'm pretty keen on because I think, at the end of the day, there's a lot of creativity out there, and it's hard for us to keep up with how much everyone out there wants to consume stuff, so it'd be fun and helpful to have some of you guys out there being able to also generate some stuff that people could enjoy and play.

It's also the reason we've not got working versions for mac. Longer term we're looking at openGL next and having conversations with various parties about supporting OpenGLNext such as AMD on the graphics card side. That's something we're looking at along with DX12, so OpenGLNext would allow us to consider things like Linux support as I'm sure they'll move to OpenGLNext too. And of course if CryTek manages to get their implementation of the current OpenGL working we'll look at it too. That's really what's been blocking us for the moment.

The M50 is pretty small, so it's likely not necessarily to have a jump drive. But we're gonna also have-... you know, that's kinda the idea of why you'd have bigger ships. So if you think about racing in today's world of people who go around racing, they have big 18-wheelers that they put their race cars in the back, and drive around the country. Or even in the case of high-end stuff like Formula 1 they put them on planes and fly them around. So we'll definitely have transporter ships that you'll be able to take your smaller, something like an M50, in. For instance if you have an 890 JUMP and you're cruising around in style in the universe, you could have an M50 sitting in the cargo bay and race it in various races... you know... just like the super rich do in today's world!So, we'll definitely have ships that can transport them around, or if you didn't have a ship that you want to do that you could probably hire someone to transport your ship to the next race location.", "published_at": "2014-09-08", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 36 (2014.09.08)", "source": "https://youtu.be/a7GBgc4GxAQ", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Azazel", "published_at_timestamp": 1410213823}, {"objectID": "373679410", "question": "How important is it to you that this game sets a visual standard for modern games? Will you try to make the graphics advanced enough to test enthusiast PCs in 2015?", "answer": "Yes! I will! Heheh... no, it's really important for me. I mean I think if you know the games I did in the past - you know, Wing Commander onwards - they were always trying to set a visual bar, and sometimes they probably went beyond what most of the machines could do at the time. Strike Commander is a pretty good example of one that, on a 486 66MHz it was a pretty amazing experience, but if you didn't have something like that then frame rate wasn't so great and all the rest of the stuff. But it was the very first PC game that had real-time proper 3D texture mapping, Gouraud shading... so it had a whole bunch of stuff that didn't show up in other games in the PC gaming world until quite a few years later. And that was mainly because we were sort of pushing it, and we read up a whole bunch of white papers from places like SIGGRAPH and tried to adapt that into the old days of software rendering - which luckily we don't have to deal with now with all the hardware rendering.But yes, so I'm very keep on pushing it. One of the reasons why I picked CryEngine was that it's visually a very advanced engine. CryEngine is the engine which did Crysis 1, which I think probably to this day is still sort the game you would think about that pushed the PC hardware platform, and was probably the last one that really had that ambition. I really would like Star Citizen to continue doing that. So CryEngine was a good base but we actually have a fair amount of graphics engineers and some core engine people, so besides the stuff we get from Crytek which actually trying to do some really cool stuff ourselves and enhance it, and we will continue to try and push it. So whatever is available in 2015, and beyond (2016, etc) we will always be trying to upgrade the visuals and push it. You can sort of see it as the game goes along. The Hornet has now been through 3 iterations; so there was the iteration from my original prototype that I showed in 2012, then we did an up-res of it for it's first debut in the hangar, and then we did yet another up-res of it for the dogfighting module, where it got fully PBRed and stuff. And you've seen the 300i get an up-res from it's hangar version, and we're doing similar stuff for the Constellation, and the Aurora, and a bunch of the other ships.

And then we've got some other things that we're thinking about, we're had a lot about Murray Cup racing, and we've been focusing. We've got some races and we want to do a race course.We'll probably release something with Arena Commander, not v1.0, but just after that we'll have some timed racing courses and stuff that you can fly your ships in, which I think will be pretty cool. And yeah, both those things could be very suited to that e-sports set up. I think what we would probably do 'cause we always like to do everything in-fiction is to sort of have the e-sports part of it almost feel in-fiction.So if you're competing to be the best dogfighter or you're competing to be the fastest racer, you're really competing in the Murray Cup in our universe. You're competing in some big, fictional, invitational tournament or whatever for the dogfighting. We'll sort of do e-sports in our universe. Kind of like Inception one level inside something else.But yes, we think that would be fun, we're also going to do a certain amount of support for people to watch stuff, so not right away, but we're looking at ways that we can have sort of windows onto action, so you can maybe log in to the website and see some cool battle happening out in space, and definitely if we have a competition or e-sports scene we would figure out ways to broadcast the combat or ways to broadcast the racing, and maybe once the Persistent Universe is up and running, you could even be in a bar in the persistent universe looking at a TV and see basically our Twitch broadcast of that which you could also see direct on our website.Hopefully that sounds cool, that's kind of what we're thinking about.", "published_at": "2014-05-26", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 22.
