Popularly referred to as \"the AI ban,\" it originated after the disappearance of the Artemis, a long-haul colony ship containing thousands of individuals in cryogenic storage. The AI that had been designed to monitor and pilot the ship was blamed, and politicians latched onto the restriction of AI research as a wedge issue to secure votes. Many countries went on to ban artificial intelligence over the next few decades. When the United Nations of Earth (UNE) was created in 2380, its architects included AI restrictions in its earliest laws. The United Planets of Earth (UPE) and the UEE kept AIRPRA in place during their formations, and it remains the law of the land. </p><br/><h1>OVERVIEW</h1><br/><p>AIRPRA grants the Senate the authority to review and approve or deny all artificial intelligence research, commercial and non commercial. It defines artificial intelligence as \"any software or hardware that can convincingly imitate intelligent Human behavior.\" This broad definition places severe limits on any kind of research that can be done in the AI field, and has effectively banned its production and use throughout the UEE. Specific guidelines include: </p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u2022 A ban on the reception of government funding for AI research.</p><br/><p>\u2022 A requirement for Senate approval on privately funded artificial intelligence research.</p><br/><p>\u2022 If approved, the research must be strictly supervised by the UEE Science and Technology Committee.</p><br/><p>\u2022 A notice that approval can be revoked at any time.</p><br/><p>\u2022 A ban on selling any product that displays signs of artificial intelligence.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p><br/><p>Any person found in violation of AIRPRA is subject to arrest and may be sentenced to imprisonment for 15 to 20 years. Corporations and research institutions found to be knowingly abetting AI research are subject to a sliding scale of fines and are subject to asset seizure. </p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>In 2043, the Eakara Company launched a line of self-driving cars powered by what they claimed to be the first true AI. This differed from earlier products marketed as AI, which were deep generative models that could mimic the qualities of Human intelligence but did not truly possess it. This new AI, Eakara promised, had the intelligence, good judgment, and fast reaction time of the most seasoned Human drivers. The city of Tokyo was an early investor, and purchased a fleet of cars and buses to bulk up their transportation infrastructure in areas too distant from train stations to be easily reached on foot. </p><br/><p>In 2044, while driving on a road on a high cliff, one of the Eakara buses made a wrong turn and plummeted over the edge to the sea below, resulting in 21 deaths. Fifteen minutes later, another bus followed, this one with 37 passengers aboard. Authorities contacted Eakara and the company's technicians sent out an emergency command to force all self-driving vehicles in Tokyo and its outskirts to immediately stop without finishing their current trips. Vehicles not engaged in active trips stopped as commanded, but those that were transporting passengers at the time ignored the command continued their trips to completion. Although the vast majority did this without incident, three more buses and 18 cars suffered fatal accidents before all vehicles in the fleet ended their trips and finally stopped moving. 113 people in total died. This became known as the \"Lemming Car Incident,\" and resulted in the dissolution of the Eakara Company. The nation of Japan banned the use of AI in self-driving cars, but similar bans would not be enacted elsewhere until deadly incidents caused by cars from other companies occurred in New York in 2044 and Johannesburg in 2047. </p><br/><p>With public distrust in AI high and investors unwilling to back AI-led ventures, researchers began to focus on its application in the sciences rather than day to day life. In 2055, an AI helped to identify a type of bacteria commonly found in the digestive systems of apex carnivores that was utilized to prevent prion diseases. Another AI helped synthesize a cure for rabies. One especially advanced AI was put in charge of calculating the spacecraft trajectories that ensured early missions to Mars were successful. These triumphs helped thaw public opinion and paved the way for AI usage in early terraforming platforms used on Mars. </p><br/><p>Designed to complete quick calculations and enact minute adjustments to the atmosphere, the Mars AI was notable for its ability to provide imaginative solutions to complex issues at a speed much higher than that of a Human and with a significantly lower margin of error. At the time, the team in charge of terraforming Mars credited the AI for the ease with which the project appeared to be progressing. However, on 13 September 2125, a miscalculation that was later linked to the AI led to the sudden catastrophic dissipation of the near-complete atmosphere, resulting in the deaths of over 4800 people. This event, deemed the \"Mars Tragedy\" in the press, again destroyed positive public opinion about AI and halted most ongoing development. </p><br/><p>In 2201, AI researcher Dr. Carol Zahir secured funding from private sources and began crafting a new type of artificial intelligence that she would name Janus. By far the most advanced AI of its time, Janus could hold conversations, draw conclusions, and make educated guesses at or beyond the level of a Human. In 2228, Roberts Space Industries (RSI) began construction of the Artemis, a long-haul colony ship that would rely on quantum travel to reach the potentially habitable planetary system codenamed GJ 667Cc. Zahir reached out to the company and proposed that Janus serve as the nerve center of the ship. Given that it would take over 200 years for the ship to reach its destination, RSI agreed. This would allow all the colonists and crew aboard to remain safely in cryogenic sleep without forcing any one of them to grow old and die while they oversaw the journey. </p><br/><p>The <em>Artemis</em> launched in 2232 to great fanfare. Soon after it was determined to be safely on course, its launch crew entered cryosleep, leaving Janus solely in charge. Janus transmitted regular reports to Earth until 2237, when any communications from it abruptly ceased. Mission control repeatedly hailed it, but Janus either refused to or could not respond. RSI and multiple governments launched extensive searches, but the <em>Artemis</em> was nowhere to be found. It seemed to have disappeared without a trace. </p><br/><p>The outcry that resulted from the loss of over 5000 people was enormous. Although it was not certain that Janus had anything to do with the disappearance of the <em>Artemis</em>, the media vocally blamed it for the catastrophe, citing the Lemming Car Incident and the Mars Tragedy as evidence. Politicians on Earth and Mars latched onto the ban of artificial intelligence as a wedge issue, using it as a springboard to secure votes and take office. As promised in hundreds of campaign speeches, they enacted a wave of bans and halted and confiscated any AI research in their jurisdiction. When the United Nations of Earth eventually formed in 2380, distrust of AI was still high enough that the Artificial Intelligence Research and Production Restriction Act (AIRPRA) became one of the newly-created government's earliest proposed laws. The Senate approved it in a landslide vote.</p><br/><h1>CRITICISM</h1><br/><p>Because the definition of AI under AIRPRA is so broad, critics have pointed out that it has been used to stifle research and technology that is only tangentially related to AI, such as more efficient autopilots for spacecraft and companies that sell interactive toys. It has also been argued that the secrecy around AI has allowed the government to conduct dangerous research of its own away from the scrutiny of the public, as revealed with the declassification of Project Overlord in 2943. </p><br/><p>Imperator Laylani Addision promised to loosen restrictions on AI research during her election campaign, stating that \"...the goal of technology should always be to help Humanity, not replace it. AI included,\" in an interview on the popular spectrum show Clean Shot. Her Innovation Initiative, launched soon after she took office in 2951, allows the issuance of special waivers to research institutions pursuing the study of AI. Any institution that receives this waiver is eligible for a limited number of government grants, and must make all advancements resulting from their research both public and free for all to use.

For example, mining bags. What's being done to resolve this?", "answer": "Great question. Unfortunately, another thing that got cut. This one's in particular, it hurt me because I made the packing and the attachment behavior and the system, the packing and arrangement works, but there's one bug I'll get to in a second that didn't. And unfortunately, because most of the items work, another thing that was sacrificed to the release gods, which hurts me because I wanted to be good because I like to be proud of my work. But the issue in particular with those, I feel I'm gonna get a little bit technical for a moment, is the pivot. So for things like cargo boxes, the pivot is on the bottom in the center. And whenever I originally wrote the packing system way back for the whole sea, the only thing that we were putting into the cargo grids at that time were the cargo boxes. I knew that more things were coming. So the packing system itself can expect any kinds of dimensions and handles multiple orientations. But the pivot was something that I just didn't have time to generalize. I had to just essentially kind of like hard code it to expect the pivot in a certain place on the item. And the technical challenge there is you might say, well, I'm holding the item. How do you not know where the pivot is? The problem is when you're doing things like calling stuff up from a freight elevator, you don't have the item. The entity isn't spawned. You don't have the geometry for it. You can't directly access the pivot. So you have to have some way to know where it would be without loading the skeleton and deriving it, which would be incredibly slow. So what we have to do is essentially kind of bake that data out into a data set that could be read from an asynchronous persistence query or based on the class data. So that's the work to be done here. It won't take too long, but it's possible it comes in very, very soon, but that's essentially it. The reason is the mining bags and these things, their pivots are in a different place than most of the other items in the game. And the system isn't yet expecting that the pivot might be somewhere else than where most of the other items' pivots are. And for that reason, the way that it rotates around and the way that it orients itself on the cargo grid is just wrong for that particular thing, which particularly for the mining bags suck because they're situated in a way that actually puts them through the freight elevator. And sometimes when they detach, they actually drop down, which is awful.

At this point I think icache/global persistence tier 1 will land before the end of the year but I don't want to specify exact dates, one thing to mention is that long term persistence did take some resources away from icache work, but we decided that it was worth it since the quality of life improvement to players would be such a benefit. Physical inventory heavily relies on icache and global persistence, and our entire system was designed around it (unlike the legacy system which was built entirely around itemports on players and ships and so concepts such as loose items and physical vs. legal ownership were unnatural to get working) . For that reason physical inventory will naturally come after that work is completed, though we are trying to find ways to get work started on it in parallel where possible.<br/><br/>pcache (persistence cache) is the legacy system, using a monolithic cache for queries to the persistent item DB. As you can imagine, this does not scale well, and worse, when it goes down the game becomes essentially unplayable. For everyone! The new icache (item cache) uses a proliferated fleet of services to optimize querying in a scalable fashion, while using best practices for fault tolerance and recovery so for example all nodes have their data replicated in the network so even if one goes down, only partial data response is briefly lost and quickly a new one is rebuilt in it's place, so automatic regeneration. The new icache is also being built with our gameplay systems in mind and understanding of how we need to query data from game servers. At this point we have a much better idea of how the game works than when the legacy p cache was created, so we can design our item data and query schema to make this new system efficient and minimal, which will also help with stability and scalability.<br/><br/>Global persistence is the term some of you may have noticed me bringing up in some of my comments and that's because it is a related but different feature set that also needs to be implemented. Just because you have a database and cool querying system for that data doesn't mean the game somehow automatically uses it in all the game systems, nor does it make servers/shards have persistent state, it just gives you a tool to use to enable that. In order to get server history persisted for everything you need to do a lot of work in server code to persist out and load back in said state, this is global persistence. I bring it up all the time because it touches so much, for example physical inventory. Inventory are just containers of items, but they are physicalized because they themselves are persistent entities with state. This means you can have a back pack with weapons or other items in it and have a way to stow/unstow from that inventory, but also that inventory can be instanced in the world and left in a vehicle or dropped off on the top of a mountain on a moon for another player to pickup. So physical inventory relies on global persistence, which relies on icache.<br/><br/>But there are other features that rely on global persistence as well, for example now we can explore gameplay that can permanently or on long term scales modify locations in the game, for example space station damage. Port Olisar could suffer an attack on a shard and it would be damaged for some time until repairs could take place. This would persist even if the server/shard went down as it is no longer just in memory state. There's a ton more, such as full server recovery after server crash. People often complain about losing cargo after a server crash, as we can't get players back into their ships right now after a server crash unlike a client crash we we lose the state of the server. With global persistence this will be recorded in the shard record it was associated with, so quickly we spin up another instance, it recovers the shard record, then we can use match making to get players back into the shard they just lost connection to, and boom, they're back in action right where they left off.<br/><br/>Hope that helps?", "title": "Ask The Devs", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/50259/thread/where-is-icache-and-physicalised-inventory-at-now", "type": "spectrum", "user": "TheAlphaFlyer", "published_at_timestamp": 1589760000}, {"objectID": "1773938e7be9e_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "In the future, yes, though quantum enforcement devices (QED) are not currently equippable by other player-flyable ships.

With 3.1 and 3.2 they were setting up a certain cadence where they were supposed to be more date-driven. This was working for them for 3.1 to 3.4, however some of the features coming in were still rough, and rougher than they'd like. For 3.5 and 3.6 they didn't release on time, and the features kept coming in later and later. For most of their features, it takes longer than 3 Sprints (3 Sprints = 6 weeks) to get it working - to get it to the quality that they want it to be. Their first iteration of Mining, for example, took that team 6 months to deliver everything that needed to be done. That said, smaller teams, or teams working on smaller features, will be able to do their work within a smaller time frame. As they were getting into the cycle, they found themselves questioning whether the work they were putting out was hitting the mark, and both the teams and the directors were feeling frustrated. As a result they started talking internally about how they could adjust things, and \"try this out and see how it works\". In the middle of each quarter they have what they call a \"Go/No-Go\" meeting which consists of the directors, including Chris, Erin, and Brian, taking a look at the features and deciding what does and doesn't \"hit the quality bar\". What should be happening is that all future work of the thing is completed, so that it's just minor bugs at that point in time, and then from there it gets dropped into the stream and it's ready for release. Before they weren't having that - some teams were and some teams weren't, so some of the quality was there and some of it wasn't. So this (seemingly the Go/No-Go meeting) allows them to make sure that there's a gate for their work to pass through, to make sure the quality they're aiming for is met. This also allows the teams a chance to reflect on why they might not have hit their quality target, which could be things like a vacation, someone was sick, or the feature was more complicated. There are a lot of times when they put things together where they have their best estimate of how long a certain piece of development is going to take, and sometimes they meet that estimate and sometimes it takes longer, but the Go/No-Go meeting allows them to look at the feature and make sure that it's hitting the quality level that they want, and then gives them 6 weeks to make sure that they're releasing to the Evocati on time, and then Wave 1 PTU, and they're making sure that the Quality of Life bugs are getting fixed and that features aren't getting dropped in 3 weeks before they're supposed to be going Live. An important point for Brian is that their releases are solid on being date-driven, and that if a feature isn't ready, then it doesn't release for that patch, and that they're not holding up any quarterly releases because a feature isn't ready, because that does everyone a disservice. That is to say, they think it's more important to keep the cadence going for the releases, rather than making sure a feature releases for a certain patch - it means that the team is immediately addressing those issues without working on bugs whilst they're in Live, and this reduces some complexity on their end as well. Jared adds that he thinks that one of the hallmarks of Star Citizen's development is the constant iteration and re-evaluation of their process - that they want to get better at making the game just as much as they want the game itself to get better, so these kinds of changes are inherent to the company. Todd says that what people need to understand is that in normal game development a company would just \"run\" until they reach Alpha, at which point they'd look at what they've done and realise that they've made a huge mess that the need to clean up before Beta, which is when they have to polish and tune the game, and have an aspect of iteration. In their case, having a Live product since very early on in its development creates challenges that sometimes they're used to and sometimes they're not, so it's a learning process for all of them regardless of how long individual people have been making games for, because Star Citizen is \"a very unique beast\". Jared says it's a double-edged sword of challenges and opportunities, where there are things that they have to account for but there are also benefits of running a Live Environment, such as the ability to get instant tangible feedback during the development process that can help guide them. Todd agreed, but added that sometimes it feels like they're building a railroad whilst they're on the train.", "title": "Star Citizen Live: All About Development", "source": "https://youtu.be/wENuiIcPK10", "transcript": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/d1e27o/a_summary_of_star_citizen_live_all_about/", "type": "youtube", "time": "2m37s", "published_at_timestamp": 1567797154}, {"objectID": "1352581740", "question": "Are there any plans to allow Players to see Points-of-Interest in other UI modes?

It\u2019s not a gigantic problem with third person camera because once you\u2019re in third person, your shooting is not that good, you\u2019d be basically a spotter at that point. You can see a bit more than other people can see but you\u2019re not going to be good at shooting. We\u2019re kinda looking into various other types of third person cameras which would restrict freedom or looking around so you can still see your character but it\u2019s not if you have free flowing third person camera that you can angle around a corner and I hide here with my camera this way.<br /><br />So, we\u2019re also looking at that so if you want to inspect your character, look at your character and see all the gear and all the cool stuff or take a cool picture of your character with some nice background. We give you a camera for that but it might be\u2026 that\u2019s not really tactical as you have almost no control over it in combat. That is another thing we\u2019re looking into, detecting combat and when you\u2019re in combat we would limit the third person camera functionality. This would prevent people that are anywhere near a gun being shot from going, \u2018oh, third person camera. I\u2019m going to look over this cover and see everything that\u2019s happening here and if it\u2019s ok then I\u2019ll go and start shooting\u2019.<br /><br />So we\u2019re kinda trying to restrict but I know you guys probably don\u2019t like being\u2026 having a restricted third person camera but we\u2019ll have to choose the lesser of two evils here because if people cheat with then we need find a solution around it. The other one would be to a very slow transition between the two cameras, so you come just go quickly from one to the other, if you want to look at third person camera for the beauty of it or because you like running in third person camera then fair enough but you should not be able to quickly transition from spying on your enemies to first person camera and headshotting everyone, cause you know exactly where they are.<br /><br />--And in that way it will stay cinematic.--<br /><br />Yeah you still have\u2026 Well cinematic is hard because you have your third person camera, third person camera will not give you, it gives you the opportunity to get in some nice shots of your character and nice backgrounds and maybe doing some recording in that mode, but you\u2019ll not get the immersion you get in first person because that\u2019s one of the man reasons we are a first person game because you\u2019re there, you\u2019re limited, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening here so you\u2019re kind of [Looks around] \u201cWhat the...\u201d, You have to look everywhere and you feel like you\u2019re constricted by your helmet and it\u2019s a different feeling.

I'm not quite sure how we'll handle that at the end of the day.I'm sure some of that will slip into lore posts, but again you don't want to make any lore posts so alien language heavy that it's going to turn somebody off and it's going to make it too difficult to read or somebody new to the game is going to be like, 'What are they even talking about?'

There's just so much information going on that it can feel overwhelming. We've got some good things in place at the moment and the Galactopedia is going to probably be, like many things in this game an iterative process.Where we start, we give the basic of stuff, the basis of a handful of things and then just build from there, because... yeah again there's just so much going on and it's actually... it's just easier to start small and do it right and do it well...

A lot of those could be answered in different portions...I think that's like 4 of 5 different questions, I think the first one to speak to for sure is staff changes, production changes, responsibilities, sharing knowledge.DV: Work still needs to get done.EKD: In this industry, in many industries of creativity. People move around, it's a very common place. People get another job, people get a promotion, they change, their spouse needs to move around the country, their kids need to go to another school, there's all kinds of reasons people come and go, it's a pretty fluid thing it's just business, right? Any company any industry has this, this is not new.So for us it's about building contingency plans and understanding who can own what in the current environment. So as somebody ships out, there's by no means ever an expectation that every producer needs to know everything, there's no way we could all do that, at the number of production we have at this company alone, it would be an overwhelming amount. So yes, we do break it down by responsibilities, we do try to say alright Darian, you're going to work with the engineering and design team in Santa Monica, you're also going to work on live releases, you're also going to do X, Y and Z, that's what you're going to try and own. You will be likely involved in these three things and you may hear about \"this\" stuff because it's in your studio, so you should be aware of it but by no means he's required to know it all.In fact, we have to trust each other, so yes when someone says hey I got another great job, my wife needs to move to this, my husband this, right, whatever. We go \"cool, here's the contingency plan\", we start to either shift out that work, look at what we may need to rehire right? It's kind of the part of the last question, re-evaluating the business needs and then we can filter that out. So if it makes sense they go okay that chunk of work that person was owning, we can probably still cover that here for a short period of time until we get support, we'll do this this and this and we'll fan it out. But ultimately we'll have a longer term plan of okay the job will go up on the website or we'll promote this person and were going to give these responsibilities, so we come up with a contingency plan and then we generally have a contingency on back of that.We also you know, you may have heard this before, the hit by the bus plan, as vulgar as that sounds and how much I hate that because I never want anyone to get hit by a bus, the idea is that would we still be able to function? Yes, we want to make sure that people are, they understand enough of what everyone is working on so we can step in to help whenever possible.DV: It's also a good sign of good management practices that the company doesn't fall apart I mean if you're someone who's so central to everything that if you can't leave for a day without things falling apart, that highlights a lot of inefficiencies in that management practice, you should be able to step away for weeks on them, because as a manager as a project manager or producer, everybody should have an understanding of what they're doing and that if I step away, those things continue on like clockwork.EKD: Yes, that's right. So there's some other questions in here. There's a good one in about difficulty exchanging information with cultural barriers, that's a great question and in fact these are two good guys to talk about it. When we were in our previous place expected to work in China for many months to set certain things up, certain operations, and that was kind of, for me personally, I know I've travelled but that was my first on the business side dealing with cultural barriers and so yeah absolutely you work with anyone that's not within 50 miles of yourself there are cultural barriers, whether it's phrases you use or the terminologies in an email or knock on effects. I just use that in this thing but that's apparently a very large thing you use in the UK, we don't use it here at all. There was also someone reference soccer, I'm sorry football, and how we should do something and I'm like I don't understand that, what are you, use basketball terms, or something else.DV: Or what they call take out food, or to go, is take away.EKD: Yeah, that's right, and that's obviously our silly examples but there definitely are on the business side, questions. We do have that added element of, 'oh what does that mean or how do we do that or you know'. It's not as bad with other english speaking cultures, right? But I know our Frankfurt office, those guys are all very fluent in english so it's worked pretty well,but there are definitely challenges.DV: It also helps that we have our guys going back and forth between offices. We have our UK producer Ricky Jutley, we've had a few of their designers here. We've sent a few of our guys out there so there is kind of a cultural exchange that goes on and it keeps the company more homogenized and unified in how we view things.EKD: Totally, that is absolutely right, so the last question on here about how do you punish an employee who is assigned a maggot.DV: Have they not seen my lead pipe of project pub scheduling?EKD: Yes, yes you have. That's a good question, it's not always as simple as that. Poor workmanship isn't always that one person failed at one thing, this is a team effort, it's always a team effort and so we want to look at it that way. We do like to find where a problem is at the root and fix it for sure but we don't run around and going \"oh this is wrong, you did it!\" Blame games don't help anyone: they don't help in family, they don't help in business, they don't help in a team.DV: It just created animosity and toxicity.EKD: Yes.DV: It's a knee jerk reaction to instantly want to point your finger like it's their fault.EKD: That's right. So it's more about understanding what the problem was, going to the root of it and then going let's figure out how to solve that problem on a mass scale as opposed to just, you know if somebody is a problem, obviously take the correct business steps for that but that's not necessarily what this conversation is about. But there are things you want to fix so you want to find the root cause and fix them.DV: Yup.Thomas Hennessy: [In the background] Communicate expectations.EKD: Yes, that's right.DV: I think there's a book Eric has.TH: Communicating, making sure that you're clearing communicating it because if they don't, maybe the expectations weren't clearly communicated and by clearly communicating it expectations that is the step to you know, because then if they fail again.EKD: Mhmm, we set these expectations, what happened?", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 12", "source": "https://youtu.be/jx2NSZOGNqE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Masq", "published_at_timestamp": 1445896605}, {"objectID": "373680890", "question": "Will players travelling in fleets be able to send out ships to scout the route ahead? How do you envision this working with instance and the matchmaking system?", "answer": "Yeah! If you're travelling in a fleet and you send a friend of yours out in a ship ahead, they can go to another area. The way this system is going to work is we only hand you off to another server if there are too many people in this area of space: in this server. So at the very beginning if there are only two people in the star system and, say you can have 50 people at maximum in any one server, just giving an example of the numbers that's not necessarily what the final numbers will be, those two people will be on the same server and that will continue; if there's ten, it would still be those ten people on the same server; and once you get over the server maximum, say 50, and we move to 60 at that point we can't fit 60 people in one server we'd say \"let's look at the locations\" and say \"here's an area that's fairly dense, say, a planet\" say it's Earth; so in Earth that would be it's own separate server zone and then people near or around Earth will be talking to the server that's controlling that; and then people on the other side of the solar system, around Pluto or flying around generally out in space would be talking to another server. And so you split out player to additional servers as more people come into the solar system and then when we have quite a few servers running that's when you have to deal with the instancing. We want to keep people together if they're part of the same organisation or they are friendly or they know each other as a person of interest. In most cases unless you get into huge battles and  loads and loads of people you can send someone ahead to scout an asteroid field and they can come back and say \"yeah it's fine\" or \"you know what, there's a couple of pirates out here!\" and the rest of your fleet would come to where you were; you'd still all be in the same server and you'd have an encounter. Even if you were on separate servers because there were too many of you in the solar system if the asteroid field was handled by a different server from where the rest of the fleet is, we always try to keep slots open on servers for friends to join and so the message would go out from your scout \"hey join me\" and there would be a certain number of slots available for the fleet and the ones that would be available would be filled and if there were too many people then we would just have to make the decision do we keep the fleet together or do we split it up and we haven't really decided on how that would work. On that you can have an argument both ways so make it user-definable or we may try it one way and see how it plays.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 68", "source": "https://youtu.be/FkjfyVDhzNs", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Eschatos", "published_at_timestamp": 1443477905}, {"objectID": "373681330", "question": "How will ship parking work in the PU? Will we be landing on instanced pads? Will our ship be pulled into a parking hangar after we land in order to make more room for other players?", "answer": "Yes, we will definitely be landing on instanced pads in the PU. So, you'll get landing permission, then you'll fly down to the planet, there'll be a pad assigned for you. You'll get out of the pad, then you'll walk into Customs and be able to go in... so if you're in ArcCorp now you'll see the Customs area, see through the window whether there'll be a landing pad where you would land in Area 18 and we would instance a fair number of those. You could see perhaps some other players landing around, so you can sort of track people coming and going but you're one particular pad will be instanced. There is some debate depending on whether we would have that ship taken off to a hangar or it would stay out on the pad for you in your sort of universe but maybe perhaps someone else would be different, we sort of gate going to the pad. You and your friends could go to your pad but someone that didn't know you and your friends or didn't have permission couldn't go to your pad. We're going to play with some of those ideas anyway that's one of the nice things with the multicrew stuff, we've got some ideas for spawning and stuff like that in that too.We definitely will need to instance it, we're not going to have a massive landing pad where you could have 50 people all landing at once because that's a huge space port. Potentially on Terra there could be a space port that has quite a few people landing on it but we'll definitely have some cases where there will be landing pads that are for one ship or maybe two ships that are instanced but that's all sort of stuff to play around with. Again, this is one of the really good things with multicrew. This is the sort of conversation that I have with Tony to try and solve the best ways to deal with it. It's the same thing as going into the social module and taking the elevator from your hangar so at what point do we put you out in ArcCorp with the other players, do we do it inside the elevator, do we do it when you step out of the elevator, what happens if someone tries to block you from getting in and out of an elevator &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; so there's a lot of edge cases that we have to work on.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 64", "source": "https://youtu.be/pxmDw89C3gU", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "MooKids", "published_at_timestamp": 1441058458}, {"objectID": "373682140", "question": "Have you already determined what will be required for a player to be entered into the Galactipedia? For example, will the discovery of a new jump point, planet, or animal species get someone in? What about when a player kills or captures an infamous pirate? How famous would that pirate have to be?", "answer": "Cherie Heiberg: Now, this is a complex question, because the determination of whether something is super influential is kind of fuzzy, it's like, relevance and something that comes up again on Wikipedia, there's so many arguments about 'that's not relevant, oh no that is relevant', but it sometimes gets articles taken down, but in simple terms, yes, the discovery of a jump-point, planet, or an animal would absolutely merit entry in the galactapedia. Important discoveries, that sort of thing, that's definitely worth reporting. As far as the pirate question is concerned, the pirate would have to be pretty famous, I mean, if you take down a minor pirate, someone who hasn't made much waves, that's definitely an interesting thing for your character to do, but if the pirate isn't well known, then I would say that it most likely wouldn't be recorded, but again this is just... it, there's so many other factors that come into play like, how many systems has that pirate raided? have they raided any systems? How many people have they attacked? It's the difference between taking down a criminal who's shoplifting and someone on the FBI's top 40 most wanted list.Adam Wieser: I know from a Pirates perspective, and even when the lore builder articles were done last year, the year before, there was a request for people to submit different pirate themed organizations, and one of the parameters for that was to realise the context, and realize how big the Empire is, and that when you are creating your own pirate character organization, most likely you won't be able to have a grip over the entire Empire, because if that happens the weight of the 'Verse would literally come down upon you. So, at this point, the pirate system is still something that, you're right, there's not gonna be many big big dogs for you to go out there hunting down, not to say that someday we won't create one, and if we do do that, if something happened with that, we might be able to get you in there, but as of right now, yeah. It would heavily depend on the circumstance, that's for sure.CH: Absolutely.

If you had that hangar on Terra you'd just probably set up your shop elsewhere. You could probably hire someone to fly your ships from that hangar to wherever you go next. I'd hope you'd be smart enough to move your assets around BEFORE you become greatly wanted in one place, because, you know, that'd be the same in real life right? But yes, you'd still have access to it, but to avoid sneaking around you'd do well to locate your pirate base elsewhere.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 47 (2014.12.01)", "source": "https://youtu.be/E8Euwh_fPeg", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Nathanalphaman", "published_at_timestamp": 1417474885}, {"objectID": "373678550", "question": "How will the cost of insurance scale in relation to ships? Will an M50 cost more to insure than say a Constellation because the M50 is designed for a much more dangerous usage i.e. racing versus cargo hauling? Or will it be based on size or ship price?", "answer": "First of all, all ships come with insurance, so it's not like you have to separately go and buy insurance for each ship, you'd just have to \"re-up\" your policy I guess if you don't have LTI, which won't be very expensive to do in the PU. Unless of course you \"obtain\" a ship in which case you'd probably have to get insurance separately. I guess the cost of insurance will be factored the same way it does in the real world, with the cost of replacement (and age) playing a part, as well as some component of what activities the ship is likely to be involved in (and the risks thereof), just like IRL a sports car tends to be more expensive to insure than a family wagon, or a caravan, because the sports cars typically drive faster and potentially get into more accidents. We haven't figured out 100% what we'll be doing with the insurance premiums, but we know we want to make it affordable. So while it'll be more expensive on bigger ships, you should be able to make more money with bigger ships (carry more cargo, win more space battles, take more salvage etc) so it'll all be proportional.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 40 (2014.10.06)", "source": "https://youtu.be/pBWJYb2Wtg0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Col.

It sort of would depend... I mean it also depends on various reputations and all the rest of the stuff. The Vanduul don't always automatically attack everyone, but they're very likely to attack a human ship, or definitely they'll attack a human military ship. But it would all be based on the reputation system, and how that particular clan had it's relationship with whoever the Banu ship was, or whatever.

We're going to actually, are planning to, be releasing content on a very regular schedule. We're actually hoping to almost be weekly if we possibly can. So we'll be constantly updating the Persistent universe, adding new features, locations, ships, characters, over hopefully years and years and years and years. I mean obviously that requires people playing the game and still being a viable enterprise, but EVE Online's still going ten years later, so we would love to be in that same position.Then we'll also do some additional story segments, very much like Squadron 42. So Squadron 42 won't be the only single player experience we do, we will be doing additional experiences like that which people will be able to play inside the Star Citizen universe.So the answer is yes we are going to do a lot of stuff in Star Citizen, but not so much, we don't really have any plans for non-Star Citizen stuff.
