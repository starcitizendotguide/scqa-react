Discovered in 2493 by Pyrotechnic Amalgamated, it was not claimed by the United Nations of Earth (UNE) due in part to the dangers surrounding its star. Instead, it was exploited by corporate interests until the 2560s, when the potential resources extracted from the system stopped outweighing the increased cost of maintaining equipment under a volatile sun. Pyro became a haven for outlaws by the early 2600s. Today, it is mostly populated by criminal factions that frequently struggle against one another for dominance. In 2947, extremist group XenoThreat seized control of Ruin Station, making them the de-facto leaders of the Pyro system.</p><br/><h1>PLANETARY SYSTEM</h1><br/><p>Pyro, the system's star, is roughly 11.3 billion years old. It is classified as a flare star, or a variable star that undergoes dramatic increases in brightness within a few minutes, releasing powerful bursts of radiation. The closest planetary body to it is Pyro I, a terrestrial planet with a dense atmosphere and a silicate crust. Of the other terrestrial planets, Bloom (Pyro III) is the only one with naturally habitable conditions. Monox (Pyro II) has enough oxygen in its atmosphere to allow a person to breathe without protective equipment for only a short time before deadly health consequences set in. Those who visit the surface of Terminus (Pyro VI) can breathe there for long periods of time, but not comfortably. The gas giant Pyro V has six true moons. The planet Pyro IV, which was likely knocked out of its original orbit around the star by a massive celestial body, now circles Pyro V as its seventh and outermost \"moon.\"  </p><br/><h1>DISCOVERY</h1><br/><p>In 2463, the watch officer of the Earth-flagged tanker ship <em>Roustabout</em>, Raj MacEwan, detected a strange signal in the Cano system. He conducted an analysis and compiled his findings into a detailed report, which he sent to the owners of the ship, Pyrotechnic Amalgamated. The board of directors chose to take no action at that time. In 2493, CEO Cecile Uchiha ordered that legacy flight records be reassessed to factor in advances in jump point detection technology. MacEwan's original report was found during this review, and the company dispatched an exploration ship to the region. After careful investigation, they discovered a jump point at MacEwan's coordinates, and entered it to find what would later be named the Pyro system on the other side. </p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>Pyrotechnic Amalgamated celebrated the discovery until surveys revealed the existence of the flare star. Although scans of Pyro II had found valuable mineral deposits, the unpredictable bursts of radiation from the system's sun would make their extraction with the technology of the day a costly endeavor. The company made the decision to report the discovery to the UNE, planning to collect government subsidies that would fund their operations and guarantee future profits. Uchiha personally reported news of the discovery, and Pyrotechnic Amalgamated was granted first crack at the system when the UNE opened it for commercial activity.</p><br/><p>While the UNE gave corporate interests like Pyrotechnic Amalgamated the green light to enter Pyro, they held back on allowing full colonization. The flare star presented a completely unknown quantity, one that could have disastrous effects on Human life. Government officials elected to conduct a voluntary ten-year pilot program that would document the effects of the star's flares on Humans. If the conclusion of the study was favorable, they would sanction colonization and officially claim the system. However, the program became one of many that were cut short in 2499, when Project Far Star located the Magnus system and the Senate voted to channel all possible resources to the terraformation of Magnus II and the construction of a new center of shipbuilding for the UNE Navy. In 2516, when more funds might have become available, the discovery of the Terra system funneled any available capital towards the development of the naturally-habitable Terra III. 2523 brought the advent of the United Planets of Earth (UPE), and along with it, a complete reorganization of the government. The question of what to do with Pyro was put on indefinite hold, and the system remained unclaimed.  </p><br/><p>Over the next few decades, commercial interest in Pyro waned as valuable minerals became thin on the ground and government subsidies dried up. After the end of the First Tevarin War (2541 - 2546), improvements in shielding technology allowed the few companies that remained in the system to extend their operations to previously unreachable areas, but this also increased the presence of outlaws as they too gained access to this tech. Eventually, bandit raids made turning a profit impossible. Some companies were forced to declare bankruptcy, including Pyrotechnic Amalgamated. By the end of the 2500s, almost all corporations had pulled out of Pyro, paving the way for outlaws to become the dominant force in the system.</p><br/><h1>CULTURE</h1><br/><p>Instead of having formal, organized government, competing gangs rule over the Pyro system, creating a series of fiefdoms that are subject to change if the local dominant faction is ousted from power. Gangs that hold particular strategic points are seen as more powerful than others, especially those who control Ruin Station and the drug labs within it. Many gangs maintain strongholds on the surface of Terminus, the planet the station orbits, that they use as launching points for attacks. </p><br/><p>Outside of its criminal organizations, Pyro maintains a moderate population of mostly Human inhabitants whose main occupation is survival. Monox's mining infrastructure, long-abandoned by its former owners, houses squatters who will fiercely defend their right to live there in spite of its hostile environment. Those who live on the naturally habitable Bloom have an easier existence, but still struggle day to day. Joining a gang and attaining its protection is largely seen as a way of attaining a better life, and many choose this path if it's made available to them. Still, numerous others refuse the option, preferring the known risks of subsistence living over the constant dangers associated with gang membership.

Some examples that are actually in right now, Virgil for example is an armor manufacture then we have Clark Defense System. We talk about these marine armors all the time or sometimes we even say CDS, they are the equivalent of a weapons manufacturer that provides the military with things but then on the clothing we have ones like Vapor Wear, they produce things like work out wear like yoga pants and things.<br />EKD: The fun thing about all these manufactures is the art, as we went through this process to evaluate things to get ready for, not just upcoming large amounts of clothes but even in recent releases it was really exciting to watch art and design narrative work together to go what does our universe look like and then look at each solar system how were they inspired over generations. We look at our clothes now you can map it back to some of the original clothes put on people\u2019s skin, it\u2019s the same thing the lore team has been doing on this universe from day one, it\u2019s an incredible timeline and back story and just a rich and full universe and it will be represented simply as manufactures of these clothes.<br /><br />ST: One last one that players definitely know already is City Lights. It is a low-end manufacture, the same way you would have an old navy or something to that effect and then the style is defined as very clean lines and they keep costs down by keeping construction simple. There is always going to be some backstory to these manufactures. To go even further to just make mention the economy and what Tony and I have talked about quite a bit, is how these manufactures operate in terms of not just the law but in the mechanics of the PU itself.<br /><br />For example, the way our shops work there\u2019s actually a global factory or inventory for a certain manufacture of shops, so if City Lights has been selling a lot of blue T-shirts eventually they are either going to have to manufacture more which will create a request for the materials that are required for this and they will then have to be delivered and then that\u2019ll also be connected to their inventory, how much of this material do they have, then they can make more of these shirts and this will propagate down through them.

For another, it's a very dedicated personnel carrier that carries quite a lot of troops for its size compared to the Redeemer or Hoplite.  And further, the Prowler, due to its Grav-Lev plates has a handling edge when it comes to getting through that last part of the landing approach, including fast landing and positioning, as well as hugging terrain features for cover from enemy defensive emplacements, which can be a significant advantage in a tight situation.  On the flip side, the Redeemer and Hoplite are designs that more heavily incorporate considerations for direct ship-to-ship combat, being a gunship and fighter, respectively.  While the Prowler does sport some pretty solid weaponry, as many fighter jocks will tell you, firepower is only one of the variables in ship-to-ship combat.  What you'll want depends greatly on how you like to play - as well as what the opposition has arrayed against you.", "published_at": "2016-11-23", "published_at_timestamp": 1479855600, "question": "Why would someone buy the Prowler over a Redeemer or Hoplite?

Will Squadron 42 be available in localized versions on release day or will you first release the English version and later add the versions for other languages?", "answer": "That's a good question. We have built localization into the game, so there is localization hooks for everything like whether it's use prompts, or people talking, so it's all there. Then this is really just going to come down to a time-scale aspect. So, once we have everything locked on the English version, then of course we'll start to do the translation.Some of them we'll do full dialogue or voice translation, some we'll just do subtitles. Then the question whether it will be sort of day-in-day all with the localized versions, or we'll do the English first, and the localized ones will come out later. It will just really depend on how long that process will take and how we feel the base game is and if people are really eager, maybe we'll give the version that's just English out to the backers so they can get it a little earlier, and then the one with the fully localized version is like the commercial release version that's a little later.But we haven't scheduled that fully yet or figured it out. We have the plan for it and we have the hooks for it, and it's really just about like the amount of time it takes to finish doing the language translation, especially the sort of dialogue. Which is kind of like dubbing if you were doing a film, and getting that back into the game, and pushing it out. And since we do it digitally, we don't really have the same criteria that maybe you would do if you had a box release.Like, in the old days when I used to do a Wing Commander, and probably true on the console games, you had to do all the localization then because you were putting it in a box, and it was going out the door. For us, we're digital, so potentially depending on schedules and timings. We may feel like, \"Well, the English version is amazing but it's going to be another four weeks before the German version is ready\". Maybe everyone wants to play something now instead of wait another four weeks so we can release the English version early or we may decide, \"Well, we'd like those extra four weeks to do some extra polish and bug testing while we're dropping in the German and the French version\", for instance.

Will there be a mechanic tin place to customise our ship loadout in the initial release of 2.0? Will the hangers be temporarily disabled?", "answer": "No, hangars will still exists. You can still load into your hangar; you can still mess around with your ships; you can still change the loadouts on your ships; and from the hangar you can access ArcCorp; you can access Port Olisar, which is the space station which you start on in 2.0; or you can go into the Simpod and access Electronic Access to play Arena Commander and, when we turn it on, Star Marine. So in some ways the hangar is still going to be the hub. We have some later stage stuff that we'll debut that will remove the loading screens and make it more seamless and streaming: it's not just there yet but it will be in the not too distant future.And longer term for the first version of 2.0 we probably won't have a holotable available or a MobiGlas UI available for you to customise your ship while you are at Port Olisar or a space station or pad but that is the long term plan. So that will be in 2.2 or somewhere around there. And ultimately we're just trying to bring this all together fairly, actually, fairly soon, but we'll be able to... Port Olisar will just be a space station orbiting in the Stanton system and you'll be able to fly down and visit Crusader; or fly down and visit ArcCorp; or fly down and visit MicroTech; or fly and go visit Nyx.

So, we are able to make highly specialized mounts, mounts with a shield, mounts with your AI or your coolant unit or whatever attached to it, um, or like we mentioned previously with the twin link mounts. Things like that would be entirely dictated by the mounts that you have available. So we can make those things pretty specifically and we do intend to, we're only beginning to try those things out. We've started actually making them and we should be able to introduce them pretty soon as they turn out pretty well.Matt Sherman: Yeah, I mean we've even just set up where not just gimble mounts even but we want to make sure that fixed mounts get to take advantage of this kind of cool functionality and pretty much any of the mounts on a ship. So armoured sleeves specifically is something that we had been talking about for fixed weapons because we've got to give you the choice of taking a similar sizing loss but now hey that component's going to be really durable and if it's your main gun on a ship that could be worth the cost.CR: Yeah, generally the rule of anything that's special about the mount costs a size.

Will we see more non-western influence, such as Indian, Chinese, Middle Eastern, etc. in upcoming locations?", "answer": "Lance Powell: So... I'll take a first stab at that. I think that \"Dan\" [Elwin] will take the second part of that.The short answer is going to be yes. The way that we're approaching the planets right now... through a lot of our sci-fi influences - and we're talking more desolate planets from Star Wars, Luke's home planet to Hoth. But we're also looking at components like Blade Runner. Basically we're drawing from all of our experiences and a lot of those are going to not just feed back into the persistent universe but we're going to have to continue to build out the persistent universe - the styles, the structures, the environments. Because you do want to show a cultural influence and how it has impacted planets.That said, the way that we've been approaching a lot of these things is through as much modern reason as we can. Which is, 100 years from now what happens to human space exploration. Well, we colonize the Moon. We colonize Mars. 200 years from now, what does it look like... okay now we've jumped out to maybe Ganymede or somewhere else. 200 years after that, we've gone out to maybe the edge of the solar system.What happens with planets like Mars is the next wave of construction. So the traditional cultural influences are really going to be determined by whoever is providing the finances to that location. But, I think more importantly, they will be building on top of the structures that have been put there. If you look at a base on the Moon or a base on Mars say in the next 100 years, you are going to find it's very modular... very container-style setup. It's more akin to Cowboy Bebop in a lot of ways or the movie Moon than almost anything else. But then say, 200 years from now you don't just scrap those structures... you now start building on top of it with something a little more modern.The art director who is driving that, Mark Skelton, and Corentin at the Montreal studio. - they are spending a lot of time focus on what those rings are and what happens when the humans leave our system and move out to the next system and that first system they move out to is a terraformed planet. Now you've got jump capabilities. That planet is now a complete overhaul of something that we've seen before, so it might not have any of the flavour that you're used to... but it may take suggestions from Dubai or a couple of other ultra-modern cities. But a lot of those things are being explored and the art direction that we've got from that so far suggests that we're going to be taking nods from all of those components but it won't be exact.A good way of looking at that would be something like Naboo. Naboo had, you know, kind of a renaissance style architecture to it. At the same time it had, you know, a lot modern day Star Wars techie stuff as well. So, it depends on the lens that you're looking at the environment from but...Short answer: Yes.Long answer: It's a little more complicated but it's going to take nods from a little bit of everything.Elwin Bachiller: We have several locations on Earth, so we will probably draw directly from the cultures at those locations. We have landing zones in Russia, China... I would expect that those are influenced by those cultures.

So the Freelancer is a pretty well armed cargo ship, maybe the Starfarer isn't as maneuverable as something like a Freelancer will be, but it's gonna have guns and turrets. If you're taking a Starfarer and taking some goods, you're probably gonna hire some people to fly escort for you.So that's how you would have to approach that. You can hire NPCs, or you could have your friends help you, or hire other players.So I'm hoping that will ensure reasonable balance of power.

That made it that when I achieved something it was much more satisfactory. I mean it was kind of frustrating, and it was difficult at times, definitely, but the sense of accomplishment I got with Demon's Souls I haven't really felt with a modern game.I think that may be one of the reasons a lot of people have shifted to multiplayer vs singleplayer because singleplayer in Call of Duty or even Battlefield is not really... Ok, it looks pretty, but do you really feel that you've accomplished something?Whereas in multiplayer, if you're fighting against someone and you take a bunch of people out, you do feel like you've accomplished something. I think maybe the dumbing down of games over the last 10 years has also lead to the rise of why multiplayer has become more popular.So I like games that are tough, so obviously Demon's Souls, I definitely like the idea of... Like I'm a Battlefield person over a Call of Duty person mainly because I like to fight with a few of my friends in that sort of cooperative combat together against other players is something I really like from Battlefield, and obviously there are aspects of that which are going to be in Star Citizen.Use of combined arms is in Battlefield, which is cool, but on a more limited basis compared to what we're doing, but again, it's cool.So I would say of non-my-past games or general games out there, I would say the three big ones that I liked more recently, or four, let's say four, were Demon's Souls, Starcraft 2, I loved the balancing, I obviously loved the original Starcraft for the sort of rock, paper, scissors dealing with your resources all the time, and I want a little bit of that in Star Citizen.Battlefield really, the fidelity's fantastic, the fact that you fight with your buddies cooperatively against other people is great, combined arms is great from there, and then probably taking a look at the Naughty Dog stuff, the Uncharted stuff and most recently the Last of Us is just in terms of fidelity and attention to detail in terms of the characters and the world they're creating it was really great.Those would all be games that I would say would be things that I was impressed by, enjoyed playing, and was fairly influence by in the near past. Hopefully that answers that question for you.", "published_at": "2014-06-09", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 24.

The Hornet has it, the 300i will have it, but something like the Aurora, which is much more of a basic ship, doesn't have the ability to eject. Some of the bigger ships will have escape pods that, if you get to them before the ship goes out, you'll be able to get out before the ship goes up in a big fiery explosion.The benefit of ejecting rather than going up in an explosion is it sort of saves a life so to speak.So if you refer back to my Death of a Spaceman write up that I did a while ago, the concept in Star Citizen is that there's a progression in your character's lives. You don't always respawn at the same level of health, and as time goes on, your body takes wear and tear.So every time you get killed in a dogfight, you'll end up waking up in a medbay,--Think of it like Luke Skywalker in The Empire Strikes Back--and maybe you've got a little bit of a prosthetic arm, or you've got a scar here.After that happens so many times, your body just can't get built back up or revived, and that character will pass away, and all your possessions and family name or whatever you want will pass on to your designated successor.The benefit of ejecting is that you get to try and preserve a life. Which is something you probably would want to do, and we may or may not have some level of... Maybe your medical bills are less because you don't have to get fixed up as much. I guess it depends whether we have national health in our world.We haven't made a decision on that particular aspect, but definitely you would want to eject before your ship blows up if you possibly can, or have a ship that will give you that, 'cause it will give you an edge.And by the way, on the Aurora you will also, if it's about ready to go, you just would have to get out of your seat and go out the airlock manually verses hitting an ejection button.", "published_at": "2014-03-17", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 12 (2014.03.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/-3KIcnKf3O0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "CC Corp", "published_at_timestamp": 1395093621}, {"objectID": "1264204001", "question": "Can you talk us through the ships? What kind of customization is the game going to offer the players? Is the customization for each ship going differ as each one of them caters to a particular need?", "answer": "There\u2019s a huge amount\u2026 Any one of our ships has somewhere from 20 to 40 different components that you can plug in, switch and mix-and-match. A lot of it has to do with how you want to fly. You can set up your ship to be just a  and then you sort of focus on weapons and generating power through those weapons and shields. You can focus on maneuverability which is much more about equipment that increases your ability to go faster and maneuver well and make turns quickly.<br/><br/>And then you can focus on something like cargo holding where you\u2019re focusing on something like space-to-ship cargo, engines to be able to drive that cargo\u2026you can have a ship with stealth stuff where it\u2019s got a very low radar signature. So there\u2019s just a huge amount of ways beyond just the individual ship types to be able to customize your ship beyond that with different roles. What I\u2019m hoping is that when you go up against certain people, certain enemies or whatever, you kind of know how they equip their ships and you sort of put a sort of countering load-out on your ship.", "published_at": "2014-02-05", "title": "Star Citizen Interview: Chris Roberts On Building A Space Simulator For The Ages", "source": "https://gamingbolt.com/star-citizen-interview-chris-roberts-on-building-a-space-simulator-for-the-ages", "type": "article", "user": "Ravi Sinha", "published_at_timestamp": 1391558400}, {"objectID": "373686050", "question": "I'd like to know about landing on planets in the really large ships. We already know that ships will land on planets Freelancer style, but what about some of the truly huge player-flyable ships such as destroyers or battlecruisers? Will these remain in orbit (crewed by our friends/AI crew) while we take a shuttle to the surface? Or will owners of these ships have to be content only docking at space stations?", "answer": "Ok, well that's a good question. We're definitely not going to let you fly the really big ships down onto the planets. So probably the Destroyer and up will not be able to go down. Although, we don't know, maybe on the Destroyer, but probably not. Kind of what you'll have to do is you'll either have to dock with a local space port and take a shuttle down to the planet. We'll probably have those on some of the bigger, busy planets, so I could see it on Earth and Terra, or just take a shuttle down, your ship's in orbit and you just take a shuttle down.
