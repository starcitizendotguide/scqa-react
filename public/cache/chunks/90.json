[{"objectID": "ecfd8b11d4c82_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "<h1>SIEGE OF TIBER</h1><br/><p>The Siege of Tiber was a key battle between the United Empire of Earth (UEE) and invading Vanduul. Lasting from SEY 2732 to 2736, it consisted of extensive ground and air engagements, mass bombings, and a military blockade from the Orion and Vector (VS-1) jump points by Vanduul forces and the Virgil and Oberon jump points by UEE forces. Losses were heavy on both sides; conservative estimates put Human and Vanduul combined casualties in the lower millions. The Siege ended with UEE defeat on 29 December 2736, when a Kingship jumped into the system from Orion. Half of the UEE's forces in Tiber were destroyed in the subsequent battle. After such heavy losses, the UEE was forced to cede Tiber to the Vanduul.  </p><br/><h1>BACKGROUND</h1><br/><p>On 18 February 2712 Tiber\u2019s neighboring system, Orion, was unexpectedly lost to the Vanduul. UEE forces that had defended Orion fell back to the Tiber system and formed a secondary defense line in anticipation of another invasion. However, the Vanduul remained in Orion to harvest its resources, and showed no intention of pursuing the retreating UEE ships. After several tense months, UEE leadership concluded that another unified incursion of allied Vanduul Clans at the scale of the Battle of Orion was unlikely to occur. The Imperator authorized the buildup of military forces at an accelerated pace to fortify the system. </p><br/><p>Regular intelligence-gathering missions were launched into Orion to spy on the Vanduul. The system didn't have a single incident until 04 February 2726, when a solitary Vanduul Blade exited the Orion jump point. By 16 November 2726, Vanduul Clans were regularly launching raids on Tiber. It seemed that another invasion might be on the horizon. </p><br/><h1>THE SIEGE</h1><br/><p>On 19 April 2732, a large Clan took and held the Tiber-Orion jump point. The UEE responded by dispatching the 81st, 22nd, 6th, and 31st Battle Groups, commanded by Grand Admiral Tesca Halimeade, to eradicate the invaders. Key ships in the Battle Groups were sent to guard the Virgil and Oberon jump points and defend other areas identified as potentially threatened. In a surprise move, Halimeade issued orders that no ship was to directly engage the Vanduul around the Orion jump point, hoping that a defensive position would stall the invasion and give him enough time to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict.</p><br/><p>By mid-2733, multiple Clans drawn into Tiber by the continued fighting were battling one another over space stations and outposts as often as they clashed with UEE forces. Most of the UEE\u2019s capital ships remained in dock during this time as Halimeade searched for a way to communicate with the Vanduul. By early 2734, three of the Clans that had emerged victorious from repeated battles against the other Clans launched separate concentrated assaults on Tiber II. They tore through the UEE\u2019s lines of defense, dropped Harvesters, and established encampments across the planet. </p><br/><p>With the loss of the Tiber II, Halimeade was forced to abandon his strategy and go on the offensive. The main flagship of the 31st long docked at INS Aniene, the UEES <em>Aquilon</em>, led the fleet to the outskirts of Tiber II in order to lure the Vanduul camped there into attacking. The strategy paid off; most Vanduul on the planet eagerly joined the fray, leaving their on-ground encampments only lightly guarded. As the battle continued, strike teams from the 81st and 22nd Battle Groups entered Tiber II\u2019s atmosphere with little resistance and conducted aerial bombardments of the Vanduul strongholds there, destroying the majority in under a few hours. The decimated Clans fled the system. </p><br/><p>Finally committed to total war, Halimeade used this bait-and-switch tactic again and again to reclaim lost territory. For over a year, Vanduul numbers slowly dwindled. However, due to more Clans entering Tiber as often as defeated Clans fled it, progress was not going as fast as UEE authorities would have liked. </p><br/><p>On 04 November 2735, a large Clan appeared in what seemed to be an insignificant part of the system. The UEES <em>Aquilon</em> and a selection of support vessels, personally led by Halimeade, went to investigate the situation. As they approached, hundreds of Vanduul poured through a previously-unknown jump point from the Vanduul system designated Vector, ambushing Halimede. The <em>Aquilon</em> was destroyed. All aboard were lost. </p><br/><p>Admiral Mira Triolo assumed authority over the four Battle Groups in Tiber after Halimeade\u2019s death, and her aggressive strategy of confronting the Vanduul head-on resulted in a sharp increase in casualties. Under her command, the UEE made multiple attempts over the next year to expel the Vanduul, but no attack was successful; Clans continued to enter Tiber from the Orion and Vector systems, and the Harvesters at work on Tiber II kept supply levels high. UEE ground troops and bombers would succeed in destroying one Harvester only for two more to be dropped in its place. Morale was low. It seemed that as long as the Vanduul held Tiber II, it would be impossible to retake the system. </p><br/><p>On 07 September 2736, Imperator Galor Messer IX ordered the military to bomb the planet into oblivion. The bombing, conducted by the 6th Battle Group on 15 November, annihilated all Vanduul encampments on Tiber II, and the planet itself was rendered to ruin. Emboldened by this success, UEE forces routed Vanduul encampments from the asteroid belt, chasing them through the Vector jump point. By 29 November, the UEE held Tiber II, the belt, and the Vector jump point. The only Vanduul left in the system set up a defensive perimeter around the jump point to Orion. Unless they retreated, their supplies would eventually run out. The 22nd and 31st returned to MacArthur for much-needed repairs, while the 81st and 6th remained behind to pick off the rest of the Vanduul. It seemed that the UEE was finally on the brink of victory. </p><br/><p>On 29 December 2736, a Kingship, a powerful class of Vanduul capital ship that had not been encountered by Humans since the Battle of Orion in 2712, entered Tiber through the Orion jump point. The combined power of the Kingship and the enormous Clan that accompanied it overwhelmed the 81st; three-quarters of its ships were wiped out in a 13 hour period, and INS Aniene was destroyed. The remainder of the Battle Group fell back to the INS Flavus before receiving order to retreat into Virgil. Admiral Triolo and the 6th stayed behind to hold the line against the Kingship. Reports from survivors indicate that the 6th was able to deal modest damage to the Kingship before losing Triolo, all its capital ships, and the majority of its carriers. As the last of the 6th Battle Group retreated into Oberon, having been cut off from Virgil, Tiber was fully surrendered to the Vanduul.</p><br/><h1>AFTERMATH</h1><br/><p>The UEE had poured all its resources into holding Tiber. When the Vanduul launched an attack on the Virgil system immediately after Tiber\u2019s loss, the UEEN was unable to mount a sufficient defense to stop them. The beaten remains of the 81st Battle Group fought off the Vanduul fleet while Squadron 214 aided the civilians evacuating from Virgil I, conducting multiple runs back and forth from Virgil through the Vega jump point. Given the choice between performing a final run and remaining safe, the 214th chose to go into Virgil one last time. Thanks to their actions, over a million civilians escaped from Virgil I. </p><br/><p>There was every expectation that Vega would be the Vanduul\u2019s next target. Instead, the Vanduul would not launch another massed attack on UEE territory until the Fall of Caliban in 2884. </p><br/><p>Today, Tiber remains a Vanduul stronghold. Harvesters continue to chew through the system\u2019s resources, strengthening any Clan that passes through the area. Because Tiber is connected to both Oberon and Virgil, it provides the Vanduul with easy raiding access to UEE territory. Oberon and Vega are frequent raiding targets. The UEE conducts periodic bombing runs to Tiber, targeting Vanduul encampments and Harvesters on Tiber II along with bases in the asteroid belt, but has been unable so far to reclaim the system.", "id": "0OaBY5pGrq", "question": "Siege of Tiber", "slug": "siege-of-tiber", "template": "Event", "title": "Galactapedia: Siege of Tiber", "type": "galactapedia"}, {"objectID": "ea49390b512bd_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Assan Kieren", "answer": "Assan Kieren (2584 - 2639?) was a Human politician representing Terra (Terra III) who publicly opposed the United Empire of Earth\u2019s pro-military agenda and then disappeared under still-unexplained circumstances.

We already have, I think, something like 40 \u2013 50 different manufacturers for the clothing and I mean it centers around a couple different styles of clothing, so we have things like Terra fashions casual vs Earth white collar or we\u2019ve got combat wear vs earth couture culture.<br /><br />So, these are sort of the styles that they represent and then there are actual manufactures within there. Some examples that are actually in right now, Virgil for example is an armor manufacture then we have Clark Defense System. We talk about these marine armors all the time or sometimes we even say CDS, they are the equivalent of a weapons manufacturer that provides the military with things but then on the clothing we have ones like Vapor Wear, they produce things like work out wear like yoga pants and things.<br />EKD: The fun thing about all these manufactures is the art, as we went through this process to evaluate things to get ready for, not just upcoming large amounts of clothes but even in recent releases it was really exciting to watch art and design narrative work together to go what does our universe look like and then look at each solar system how were they inspired over generations. We look at our clothes now you can map it back to some of the original clothes put on people\u2019s skin, it\u2019s the same thing the lore team has been doing on this universe from day one, it\u2019s an incredible timeline and back story and just a rich and full universe and it will be represented simply as manufactures of these clothes.<br /><br />ST: One last one that players definitely know already is City Lights. It is a low-end manufacture, the same way you would have an old navy or something to that effect and then the style is defined as very clean lines and they keep costs down by keeping construction simple. There is always going to be some backstory to these manufactures. To go even further to just make mention the economy and what Tony and I have talked about quite a bit, is how these manufactures operate in terms of not just the law but in the mechanics of the PU itself.<br /><br />For example, the way our shops work there\u2019s actually a global factory or inventory for a certain manufacture of shops, so if City Lights has been selling a lot of blue T-shirts eventually they are either going to have to manufacture more which will create a request for the materials that are required for this and they will then have to be delivered and then that\u2019ll also be connected to their inventory, how much of this material do they have, then they can make more of these shirts and this will propagate down through them. It\u2019s not just filling them in terms of backstory it\u2019s also about making them relevant to the experience. You know what I mean?<br /><br />OE: Yeah it sounds like a full in-depth system.<br /><br />ST: Yeah definitely, it was interesting cause we talked about stocking and inventory and like honestly it\u2019s funny because we get a programmer writing something as if he was working at Macy\u2019s, like it\u2019s a real system.", "title": "Exclusive Star Citizen Interview With Sean Tracy & Eric Kieron Davis", "source": "https://youtu.be/xGV2996y4Jk", "time": "0m42s", "type": "youtube", "user": "Oliver East", "transcript": "http://www.justpushstart.com/2017/03/exclusive-star-citizen-interview-sean-tracy-eric-kieron-davis-full-transcript/", "published_at_timestamp": 1490484602}, {"objectID": "373672190", "question": "Has CIG made incentives to keep people playing Star Citizen?", "answer": "The obvious answer is you're always going to try and get the better ship and play against or cooperate with players, but to Tony the thing that is really going to differentiate is the ability to experience new things. This will involve reaching cities you've never seen to new AI behaviors and new challenges and overcoming them. The approach with modular technology as a tool rather than being the only entity will allow them to generate a lot of content, but putting their personal touches and creating a unique experience for players. It's the little things that keep players coming back, it's what makes you want to keep playing. The way things are built, they've created a system that allows them to make the majority of everything, but then you can add extra touches to those creations in whatever way you would want to without the effort of creating brand new assets. They planned long term, not short term when making the tools and making the game and this allows them a lot of flexibility down the road.

It's just a cool ship, for one thing.  The Prowler definitely gets style points.  For another, it's a very dedicated personnel carrier that carries quite a lot of troops for its size compared to the Redeemer or Hoplite.  And further, the Prowler, due to its Grav-Lev plates has a handling edge when it comes to getting through that last part of the landing approach, including fast landing and positioning, as well as hugging terrain features for cover from enemy defensive emplacements, which can be a significant advantage in a tight situation.  On the flip side, the Redeemer and Hoplite are designs that more heavily incorporate considerations for direct ship-to-ship combat, being a gunship and fighter, respectively.

Will Squadron 42 be available in localized versions on release day or will you first release the English version and later add the versions for other languages?", "answer": "That's a good question. We have built localization into the game, so there is localization hooks for everything like whether it's use prompts, or people talking, so it's all there. Then this is really just going to come down to a time-scale aspect. So, once we have everything locked on the English version, then of course we'll start to do the translation.Some of them we'll do full dialogue or voice translation, some we'll just do subtitles. Then the question whether it will be sort of day-in-day all with the localized versions, or we'll do the English first, and the localized ones will come out later. It will just really depend on how long that process will take and how we feel the base game is and if people are really eager, maybe we'll give the version that's just English out to the backers so they can get it a little earlier, and then the one with the fully localized version is like the commercial release version that's a little later.But we haven't scheduled that fully yet or figured it out. We have the plan for it and we have the hooks for it, and it's really just about like the amount of time it takes to finish doing the language translation, especially the sort of dialogue. Which is kind of like dubbing if you were doing a film, and getting that back into the game, and pushing it out. And since we do it digitally, we don't really have the same criteria that maybe you would do if you had a box release.Like, in the old days when I used to do a Wing Commander, and probably true on the console games, you had to do all the localization then because you were putting it in a box, and it was going out the door. For us, we're digital, so potentially depending on schedules and timings. We may feel like, \"Well, the English version is amazing but it's going to be another four weeks before the German version is ready\". Maybe everyone wants to play something now instead of wait another four weeks so we can release the English version early or we may decide, \"Well, we'd like those extra four weeks to do some extra polish and bug testing while we're dropping in the German and the French version\", for instance.

Will there be a mechanic tin place to customise our ship loadout in the initial release of 2.0? Will the hangers be temporarily disabled?", "answer": "No, hangars will still exists. You can still load into your hangar; you can still mess around with your ships; you can still change the loadouts on your ships; and from the hangar you can access ArcCorp; you can access Port Olisar, which is the space station which you start on in 2.0; or you can go into the Simpod and access Electronic Access to play Arena Commander and, when we turn it on, Star Marine. So in some ways the hangar is still going to be the hub. We have some later stage stuff that we'll debut that will remove the loading screens and make it more seamless and streaming: it's not just there yet but it will be in the not too distant future.And longer term for the first version of 2.0 we probably won't have a holotable available or a MobiGlas UI available for you to customise your ship while you are at Port Olisar or a space station or pad but that is the long term plan. So that will be in 2.2 or somewhere around there. And ultimately we're just trying to bring this all together fairly, actually, fairly soon, but we'll be able to... Port Olisar will just be a space station orbiting in the Stanton system and you'll be able to fly down and visit Crusader; or fly down and visit ArcCorp; or fly down and visit MicroTech; or fly and go visit Nyx. So all the early stages of the PU are gestating with SC Alpha 2.0 and it's the first baby step.

So, we are able to make highly specialized mounts, mounts with a shield, mounts with your AI or your coolant unit or whatever attached to it, um, or like we mentioned previously with the twin link mounts. Things like that would be entirely dictated by the mounts that you have available. So we can make those things pretty specifically and we do intend to, we're only beginning to try those things out. We've started actually making them and we should be able to introduce them pretty soon as they turn out pretty well.Matt Sherman: Yeah, I mean we've even just set up where not just gimble mounts even but we want to make sure that fixed mounts get to take advantage of this kind of cool functionality and pretty much any of the mounts on a ship.

Will we see more non-western influence, such as Indian, Chinese, Middle Eastern, etc. in upcoming locations?", "answer": "Lance Powell: So... I'll take a first stab at that. I think that \"Dan\" [Elwin] will take the second part of that.The short answer is going to be yes. The way that we're approaching the planets right now... through a lot of our sci-fi influences - and we're talking more desolate planets from Star Wars, Luke's home planet to Hoth. But we're also looking at components like Blade Runner. Basically we're drawing from all of our experiences and a lot of those are going to not just feed back into the persistent universe but we're going to have to continue to build out the persistent universe - the styles, the structures, the environments. Because you do want to show a cultural influence and how it has impacted planets.That said, the way that we've been approaching a lot of these things is through as much modern reason as we can. Which is, 100 years from now what happens to human space exploration. Well, we colonize the Moon. We colonize Mars. 200 years from now, what does it look like... okay now we've jumped out to maybe Ganymede or somewhere else. 200 years after that, we've gone out to maybe the edge of the solar system.What happens with planets like Mars is the next wave of construction. So the traditional cultural influences are really going to be determined by whoever is providing the finances to that location. But, I think more importantly, they will be building on top of the structures that have been put there. If you look at a base on the Moon or a base on Mars say in the next 100 years, you are going to find it's very modular... very container-style setup. It's more akin to Cowboy Bebop in a lot of ways or the movie Moon than almost anything else. But then say, 200 years from now you don't just scrap those structures... you now start building on top of it with something a little more modern.The art director who is driving that, Mark Skelton, and Corentin at the Montreal studio. - they are spending a lot of time focus on what those rings are and what happens when the humans leave our system and move out to the next system and that first system they move out to is a terraformed planet. Now you've got jump capabilities. That planet is now a complete overhaul of something that we've seen before, so it might not have any of the flavour that you're used to... but it may take suggestions from Dubai or a couple of other ultra-modern cities. But a lot of those things are being explored and the art direction that we've got from that so far suggests that we're going to be taking nods from all of those components but it won't be exact.A good way of looking at that would be something like Naboo. Naboo had, you know, kind of a renaissance style architecture to it. At the same time it had, you know, a lot modern day Star Wars techie stuff as well. So, it depends on the lens that you're looking at the environment from but...Short answer: Yes.Long answer: It's a little more complicated but it's going to take nods from a little bit of everything.Elwin Bachiller: We have several locations on Earth, so we will probably draw directly from the cultures at those locations. We have landing zones in Russia, China... I would expect that those are influenced by those cultures.

I mean, it needs a designer to design it.DV: And by the time we do work on it, we don't know where tablet or mobile technology is gonna be at.TD: It would be super cool, have you seen the videos of some of the people that have converted their living rooms into like a Constellation bridge deck... and yeah, having those and being like [twiddles fingers on imaginary touchscreens], having your guys next to you're all- ahh man that'd be so much fun.DV: I actually saw someone on the forums made a companion tablet app that could actually change their equipment, and actually I believe they were inputting in-game commands to like shoot their guns while they were in Broken Moon playing against the Vanduul, I coulda swore I saw them actually using a tablet to actually enter commands.TD: Huh!DV: So, the tech is there, and...AM: You sure he wasn't just updating Facebook or something?DV: He could've been... [laughter]TD: Well, maybe we should rephrase the question then. Are there plans?

So the Freelancer is a pretty well armed cargo ship, maybe the Starfarer isn't as maneuverable as something like a Freelancer will be, but it's gonna have guns and turrets. If you're taking a Starfarer and taking some goods, you're probably gonna hire some people to fly escort for you.So that's how you would have to approach that. You can hire NPCs, or you could have your friends help you, or hire other players.So I'm hoping that will ensure reasonable balance of power. Then of course if you're trading in the safe areas, the regulated areas, there are significant penalties for people trying to attack you and raid you.So you're likely to be fairly safe trading inside the core UEE worlds, but as you get further out, you'll be less safe.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 28.

That made it that when I achieved something it was much more satisfactory. I mean it was kind of frustrating, and it was difficult at times, definitely, but the sense of accomplishment I got with Demon's Souls I haven't really felt with a modern game.I think that may be one of the reasons a lot of people have shifted to multiplayer vs singleplayer because singleplayer in Call of Duty or even Battlefield is not really... Ok, it looks pretty, but do you really feel that you've accomplished something?Whereas in multiplayer, if you're fighting against someone and you take a bunch of people out, you do feel like you've accomplished something. I think maybe the dumbing down of games over the last 10 years has also lead to the rise of why multiplayer has become more popular.So I like games that are tough, so obviously Demon's Souls, I definitely like the idea of... Like I'm a Battlefield person over a Call of Duty person mainly because I like to fight with a few of my friends in that sort of cooperative combat together against other players is something I really like from Battlefield, and obviously there are aspects of that which are going to be in Star Citizen.Use of combined arms is in Battlefield, which is cool, but on a more limited basis compared to what we're doing, but again, it's cool.So I would say of non-my-past games or general games out there, I would say the three big ones that I liked more recently, or four, let's say four, were Demon's Souls, Starcraft 2, I loved the balancing, I obviously loved the original Starcraft for the sort of rock, paper, scissors dealing with your resources all the time, and I want a little bit of that in Star Citizen.Battlefield really, the fidelity's fantastic, the fact that you fight with your buddies cooperatively against other people is great, combined arms is great from there, and then probably taking a look at the Naughty Dog stuff, the Uncharted stuff and most recently the Last of Us is just in terms of fidelity and attention to detail in terms of the characters and the world they're creating it was really great.Those would all be games that I would say would be things that I was impressed by, enjoyed playing, and was fairly influence by in the near past. Hopefully that answers that question for you.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 24.

The Hornet has it, the 300i will have it, but something like the Aurora, which is much more of a basic ship, doesn't have the ability to eject. Some of the bigger ships will have escape pods that, if you get to them before the ship goes out, you'll be able to get out before the ship goes up in a big fiery explosion.The benefit of ejecting rather than going up in an explosion is it sort of saves a life so to speak.So if you refer back to my Death of a Spaceman write up that I did a while ago, the concept in Star Citizen is that there's a progression in your character's lives. You don't always respawn at the same level of health, and as time goes on, your body takes wear and tear.So every time you get killed in a dogfight, you'll end up waking up in a medbay,--Think of it like Luke Skywalker in The Empire Strikes Back--and maybe you've got a little bit of a prosthetic arm, or you've got a scar here.After that happens so many times, your body just can't get built back up or revived, and that character will pass away, and all your possessions and family name or whatever you want will pass on to your designated successor.The benefit of ejecting is that you get to try and preserve a life. Which is something you probably would want to do, and we may or may not have some level of... Maybe your medical bills are less because you don't have to get fixed up as much. I guess it depends whether we have national health in our world.We haven't made a decision on that particular aspect, but definitely you would want to eject before your ship blows up if you possibly can, or have a ship that will give you that, 'cause it will give you an edge.And by the way, on the Aurora you will also, if it's about ready to go, you just would have to get out of your seat and go out the airlock manually verses hitting an ejection button.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 12 (2014.03.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/-3KIcnKf3O0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "CC Corp", "published_at_timestamp": 1395093621}, {"objectID": "1264204001", "question": "Can you talk us through the ships? What kind of customization is the game going to offer the players? Is the customization for each ship going differ as each one of them caters to a particular need?", "answer": "There\u2019s a huge amount\u2026 Any one of our ships has somewhere from 20 to 40 different components that you can plug in, switch and mix-and-match. A lot of it has to do with how you want to fly. You can set up your ship to be just a  and then you sort of focus on weapons and generating power through those weapons and shields. You can focus on maneuverability which is much more about equipment that increases your ability to go faster and maneuver well and make turns quickly.<br/><br/>And then you can focus on something like cargo holding where you\u2019re focusing on something like space-to-ship cargo, engines to be able to drive that cargo\u2026you can have a ship with stealth stuff where it\u2019s got a very low radar signature. So there\u2019s just a huge amount of ways beyond just the individual ship types to be able to customize your ship beyond that with different roles. What I\u2019m hoping is that when you go up against certain people, certain enemies or whatever, you kind of know how they equip their ships and you sort of put a sort of countering load-out on your ship.", "title": "Star Citizen Interview: Chris Roberts On Building A Space Simulator For The Ages", "source": "https://gamingbolt.com/star-citizen-interview-chris-roberts-on-building-a-space-simulator-for-the-ages", "type": "article", "user": "Ravi Sinha", "published_at_timestamp": 1391558400}, {"objectID": "373686050", "question": "I'd like to know about landing on planets in the really large ships. We already know that ships will land on planets Freelancer style, but what about some of the truly huge player-flyable ships such as destroyers or battlecruisers? Will these remain in orbit (crewed by our friends/AI crew) while we take a shuttle to the surface? Or will owners of these ships have to be content only docking at space stations?", "answer": "Ok, well that's a good question. We're definitely not going to let you fly the really big ships down onto the planets. So probably the Destroyer and up will not be able to go down. Although, we don't know, maybe on the Destroyer, but probably not. Kind of what you'll have to do is you'll either have to dock with a local space port and take a shuttle down to the planet. We'll probably have those on some of the bigger, busy planets, so I could see it on Earth and Terra, or just take a shuttle down, your ship's in orbit and you just take a shuttle down.
