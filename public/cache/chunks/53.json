There's a Helmsman position and the difference between the bigger ships is you'll have multiple crew stations, multiple seats where people, one person's just the helm, the other person's doing coms, the other person's doing weapons, the other person's doing radar and potentially you have a captain seat and they're giving instructions to the various people manning the seats.I would say it's a bit more ... You're being sort of, I don't know whether it's cockpit style seat control because potentially the interface for you controlling the ship is a little different, but it will be very much like a helmsman station on a navy ship that you would see in today's world and that's how we've set up the Idris and how we're setting up the bengal and I would assume that would be there. There may be a mode that we'll do because we've talked about several different kinds of modes, one you're sort of moving your ship around because the big ships are going to be slow, it's like moving a slow ferry or tank around. There maybe a mode you can switch into where if you got the certain kind of flight control system besides just maneuvering the engine's position and strafe position on your ship, you also can maybe have a holographic display and you can click and say, \"I want the ship to go to this area or that area\" and then the cap ship version of IFCS tries to get you there and then you can manually take it over and adjust the courses.So that's kind of what we've set up, I mean John Pritchett already has a task for him to sort of do that second second stage. So stage one of the cap ship stuff is the big massive ship handling which we're in progress for,  we need it for the Starfarer and then obviously the Idris afterwards and the second stage would be kind of a more go two positional mode that you could do where you could say, \"Ah I want to go 100 meters to this spot, 100 meters ahead\" and the system tries to maneuver you thereSo you'll have those and you'll be able to switch between both of them, so I hope that answers your question.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 81", "source": "https://youtu.be/n6g-ECx-7xw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Witcher", "published_at_timestamp": 1459807296}, {"objectID": "373679600", "question": "As additional features, functionality and game mechanics come online, the need for an updated game manual becomes more important especially as we bring new backers on board.

We are partly dealing with the downside of having such a big team: you've got a team in this location  [gestures left] working on this feature; team in this location [gestures right] working on this feature; a team in this location [gestures far right] working on this other feature. And a lot of times it's like \"Oh, what am I going to do for activating autopilot?\", \"Oh, what am I going to do for going to cruise?\" So at the time the developer is like \"Oh, this key's not used: let's use this key\".But there hasn't been an overall 'ten thousand foot' view of that and that's something we've been wanting, planning, meaning to do. Everyone's just been so busy with stuff. But with the release of 2.0 I feel it is very important to increase, to improve, the UX experience greatly. As you get into the game it should be, if you don't know much about it, it should help you learn how to fly your ship. Also as you upgrade your ships they could get more and more complicated, so the basic Aurora should not have all the features in terms of tweaking your IFCS, or doing as much targeting, or fidelity stuff, that a dedicated combat fighter ship, like a Hornet or a Sabre or a Gladius, would necessarily do.I think one of the big keys is to have that gradation of complexity in avionics, complexity in weapon systems, that come with the components and the whole system we've got. So you start out, first get into the game, and it's fun: you can fly around pretty easy, it's easy to pick up. You know now to play an FPS game so you know how to move around. And then you go \"oh, you know what, I really want to know more about this\" and you can turn on the 'advanced mode' just like anything you do on your dialog box on most software you use there's  the 'basic/simple use' or and the 'advanced mode'. We'll have versions of that and you'll also want to be upgrading, so the base starter Aurora will have a simple avionics package but maybe the Legionnaire has a more complicated one with the 'advanced mode' that allows you to do more tweaking than you can do right now.So we want to make that experience better. We want to unify the controls: you don't want to go from FPS to EVA to flying a ship and strafing left and right on the keyboard are all different keys. It should be consistent. So we're making a big push to improve the UX and the whole so it should just feel like \"okay, I go left and right: same keys no matter which mode I'm in\".So we are trying to do that as an overall pass; make the experience better; have your 'Bitching Betty' \"hey do you want me to walk you through the flight controls sir?\" when you first get into the ship as a new player. So all those things I think will help out a lot in addition to the manual we are doing. It's pretty important for us. I think we've got to the point now where all these systems together and we need to unify the user experience. We've got to make it less complicated for the people first beginning to play. And we still have to keep all the detail and complexity for the experts. And that's a great game learning curve.People say it all the time but \"simple to learn, difficult to master\". So it's get in, have fun and then you want to push it, you want to be a better combat pilot, you want to be a better racer, well pull of the the 'training wheels' and start turning the knobs. So we're going to be focusing on that as a priority for me in the early part of this year.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 74", "source": "https://youtu.be/qqcN6UkKfog", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Shrike", "published_at_timestamp": 1451947767}, {"objectID": "373679970", "question": "I recently have stopped playing an FPS game that uses CryEngine, because of the amount of cheats players are using (aimbot, for example). Are you considering any special cares for SC against these kind of activities?", "answer": "We definitely are aware and have plans to do stuff to crack down on cheating obviously we're at a very early stage, so at these early days we're not doing as much as we will do long term, because we're just trying to get the basic fundamentals in there.Not sure which CryEngine game you play, if it was an FPS one. Depends on whether it was a peer to peer or a server client model. Server client model's a bit easier to validate and make sure there isn't as much cheating because you own the server which we would, and that's, you can always do sanity checking against what the client is doing. So we definitely plan to have stuff in there to try and stop people from cheating by using bots and everything.There's always ways that people figure out how to do stuff, but that definitely is on our road map to try to make the experience as good for everyone as possible and I would also say it is, Star Citizen isn't a pure competitive FPS game, it has everything, right, that's part of what you can see in 2.0 there is FPS stuff, there's flying the ships around. In the big universe there's going to be exploration , visiting places, talking to people, doing things like hauling cargo, mining, so I don't think it will have the same sort of pressure that you see in a straight up FPS arena shooter or something like Team Fortress or War Face which is a Crysis based free to play shooter. So we'll see, but we definitely are going to try our best to make sure that people don't abuse the system and cheat.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 72", "source": "https://youtu.be/oiXlK8UtLhg", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "R0das", "time": "3m48s", "published_at_timestamp": 1450133932}, {"objectID": "9edf882754035_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "This is still in the plans.", "published_at_timestamp": 1441317600, "question": "Will the turret of the Vanguard Warden still be able to fully retract, like it was shown in the original concept?", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/14935-Q-A-Vanguard-Variants-Part-II", "title": "Q&A: Vanguard Variants - Part II", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "373681940", "question": "We've had some highly publicized staff departures.

You can't really stand in the way of something like that.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Generally on a turnover basis, it's been no different than when Chris was at Origin, a studio that grew from six at the beginning, to 110 when EA bought it, to 300 or so when Chris left; didn't even know half the people and people were always coming and going, and that just kind of happens; it's unfortunate and sometimes it's for personal reasons.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; At CIG they've got a really great group of people and really great infrastructure; in some ways people see it more than they would normally, because they show more people than just the front person on a project, but you won't see the whole staff.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; CIG show the whole staff, especially those in L.A.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Just because one person is showing off a feature, doesn't necessarily mean they're the one driving it.

There will probably be restrictions to that, such that the engineering station is probably tailored towards engineering no matter how much you plug weapons into it. But broadly you should be able to do almost anything that you wanted. For the first one, you will be able to, as a pilot, have control of your guns and if you have a copilot they'll take control of your turrets and down the road you'll be able to mix and match those things pretty much however you want.Matt Sherman: Yeah, it's definitely part of the long term plan for things but it's going to be a big addition once multicrew is rolled out and we really get to start tuning that extra gameplay.CR: Yeah.", "published_at_timestamp": 1433800772, "question": "I am just curious about the limits of the various Seat roles.

You see games have developed over time, you can actually visualize that romance between characters with different cinematography, different scenes. Usually by the cutscenes, but also in the actual gameplay and actions that you can do, being able to develop a good personal relationship with significant others, so to speak, and I think Star Citizen's going to give you a great opportunity to probably do that, because there's going to be so many different people, so many different beings, in the 'Verse, yeah. I think that's something we need to...Travis Day: Yeah, I think Squadron 42 too, I mean, what they're calling out is Mass Effect and Dragon Age which, it's obviously much easier to handle relationships and romantic relationships in a single player environment, not really in an MMO, so one of the things I think that Chris is famous for, in the Wing Commander games, is having those interactive cutscenes, having the ability to make those kinds of decisions, and the branching relationships that we had with some of the wingmen in wing commander, and I know that's something for a fact that he's definitely planning on doing in SQ42, where your decisions, your actions, they will matter to your wingmen and they'll impact your relationships.

I'd like to be the Michael Savage, fear-mongering about alien races or the imperator or something.Darian Vorlick: The reason why I liked this question is it's kind of an ongoing thing, almost a pet project of mine in a way. My personal goal, if the game will allow me, is to take an 890 jump and gut in the inside, turning it into a traveling nightclub, with my DJ character floating around in a DJ booth and if we have the tech to stream though it or whatever. Perhaps every year, or every week it goes from on system to another, a large circuit. Every time it comes back around, it's a big media deal, and everybody buys tickets and parties while its there.TD: I always wanted to be like Lord British, cruising around as an advocacy agent, answering peoples questions and solving problems.

In terms of whether you're marked to being in a stolen ship as opposed to someone who might have just found a ship and reclaimed it... I don't know! I think we'll try to handle it is, say if you were shooting them until they ejected, that would count as stealing the ship. If you were aligned to a group that shot the ship, that'd be stealing as well, but if you weren't witness to the events leading to it being left there, and you're not aligned with a party that was involved, potentially that would be counted as a reclamation. It depends I guess, there will be lots of edge cases. We haven't fleshed out the various rules for this one yet, but rest assured we'll try to make it fair.

Some of the ships like the Hornet doesn't really have that. You would have to open the canopy, vent your air, then detach yourself from the seat.But yeah, we have a full zero-g plan for movement, so if you have an EVA suit, it will have little thrusters to move around. You'll also be able to grab hold on the side of things.So if you think like the movie Gravity, so that's all stuff that the team working on first person combat is doing. So they've got zero-g combat, EVA stuff, on their plate, and we're focusing on simulating that correctly.The idea would be that you're going outside to potentially board other ships, or potentially go out and do some patch up repairs. You'll never be able to properly repair your ship, you have to do that down on a planet, but just to get you going.Those are all things you'd do, and I definitely think there could be a case where you'd EVA into a space wreck.
