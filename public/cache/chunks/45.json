It was founded in 2811 by Marana River (2788-2887). Every year, the IAF awards grants and fellowships to artists who work with a wide variety of forms, including music, sculpture, dance, performance, digital media, and writing.</p><br/><h1>BACKGROUND</h1><br/><p>After graduating from Aydo Polytechnic with a degree in sculpture, heiress Marana River was able to work comfortably as an artist thanks to her family's wealth. Many of her friends, however, struggled to make art and support themselves at the same time. This difference in circumstances pushed River to research how she could provide artists like her friends with enough money to concentrate on their work without worrying about paying rent or obtaining basic necessities.</p><br/><p>Enlisting the help of her parents, River secured initial funding to hold a gala, to which she invited local businesses, government officials, celebrities, and wealthy friends. The gala was a success; in its first year, the organization raised roughly 3 million UEC. With these funds, River registered her new charity under the name Green Foundation for the Arts and hired her first employees. She continued to hold other fundraiser events alongside her annual gala, and after six years of fundraising, established an endowment of 400 million UEC. The charity awarded grants only to new artists on Green for eleven years. When it opened a second branch on Aremis (Vega II) in 2829, it was renamed the Imperial Arts Foundation and amended its mission to support new artists in all parts of the UEE.</p><br/><h1>EVENTS</h1><br/><p>The IAF sponsors two major events every year: the Green Gala and the Folk Arts and Music Fair. The Green Gala, held at the Green Museum of Art, is a red-carpet, invite-only event used to generate funds for the IAF. Celebrities and philanthropists attend alongside IAF grant recipients selected by an independent committee of arts peers. Each gala is assigned a theme to set the tone for attendees' formal dress. The Folk Arts and Music Fair, held on multiple planets on a rotating basis, is an arts festival showcasing traditional and non-traditional arts unique to each planet in the UEE. The first fair, held on Saisei (Centauri III) in 2847, honored traditional Saisei instrument craft.</p><br/><h1>AWARDS</h1><br/><p>In addition to grants, the IAF gives out awards to artists who demonstrate outstanding potential. Those early in their careers are given the River's Promise Award and a monetary prize. The Eminence Award is given to artists who have benefited from IAF grants and have gone on to achieve prominence in their chosen discipline. Lastly, supporters who have donated to the IAF, without whom the charity would be unable to continue its mission, are recognized with a Patron of the Arts Award.", "id": "RX3Nr11PPk", "question": "Who is Imperial Arts Foundation?", "slug": "imperial-arts-foundation", "template": "Company", "title": "Galactapedia: Imperial Arts Foundation", "type": "galactapedia", "published_at": "2024-10-25", "published_at_timestamp": 1729823822}, {"objectID": "0rxqDJrxp3-galactic-tour-galactic-gear", "question": "What is the Galactic Tour (Galactic Gear)?", "answer": "<em>Galactic Tour</em> (formerly <em>Galactic Gear</em>) is a Spectrum show hosted by Jax McCleary that reviews spacecraft after putting them through outlandish tests.

Could we expect to see a pledgeable capital ship, such as the new corvette, have its design influenced by those of the Covenant?", "answer": "Elwin Bachiller: That's a hard one to answer. I know for me, I try to keep my references as real-world as possible. We do have other spaceships that we look at as reference and inspiration as well, but we're definitely not sitting down and picking other ships from other universes and saying, \"We want this ship.\" It really comes down to the purpose - what is it that we're trying to accomplish with the personality of the vessel, what it's purpose is, and then we build from there. We may use small elements from other sci-fi universes that we've seen but we're definitely not sitting there saying, \"We need our version of exactly that ship.\" That doesn't happen.Lance Powell: To add additional information to the conversation. This isn't a direct response to the question but one of the things the design team is looking at is using frequencies of light. If you're using a red laser, you're going to have a longer band and it will have less impact. If you're using a green laser it will be somewhere in between. If you're using a blue laser, it will be a shorter frequency and far more damage. Everything in between, all of the various damage styles. The various range styles that come along with that. So, the complexity - it's being discussed right now to incorporate more real-world style future laser effects.I think things like neutron weapons, proton weapons, we're treating more like practical physics instead of traditional sci-fi. The weapon itself will provide - knock a couple of neutrons off of an atom and all of a sudden you've got an accumulation of something with extremely heavy mass. So, instead of it being a beam weapon... it is a beam weapon but it's like you got hit by a bus.", "published_at": "2015-05-18", "title": "10 for the Artists: Episode 02 (2015.05.18)", "source": "https://youtu.be/shxj7XXKgr4", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Jack Cruise", "published_at_timestamp": 1431986585}, {"objectID": "571c283dbbf63_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "We can't offer too many additional details, but rest assured your fish will have a home In both the Gemini and standard Starfarer (unless you swap out the captain's quarters for another room!)", "published_at": "2015-05-13", "published_at_timestamp": 1431468000, "question": "Can you go into any detail regarding the difference in the variants internals?

This is something we ran into when we first implemented the turrets in the Constellation for the gamescon livestream. When we were in the turret and the pilot is flying around in all 6 degrees, it was a huge pain in the ass to track your targets.Calix Reneau: I think it was about 4-5 days after getting the turrets working in the Constellation before someone got a kill using them.DT: As soon as Paul got a hold of it he said he had to change that right now. He actually passed that job off to Mark to do, but he got it working so that the view kinda tracked the world a little as best as was possible with the movement of the ship.

They would not be jump capable. And then the short range fighter would depend... I mean, something like the Merlin, which is probably the example of the smallest and shortest range of one, really couldn't operate for that long outside of being re-docked back in the Constellation and refueled and rearmed. Some of the military short range or lighter fighters would obviously have a lot more range than that.

Specifically with the Warhorse stuff, they've got some very nice tech for how all their NPCs wear different outfits and clothes.They've got pre-computed morph stuff that takes the shirt and fits it to the body, then the chest plate if they have armor goes on top of that.So we're looking at using that to make our character modification pipeline smoother.I think we've talked to them, we've got some enhancements to the attachment system in CryEngine, which is a bit technical, but that's how you attach different things to a character or a body.We have a much more extendable and robust system than the default CryEngine, so we've talked about getting that, and then we're doing some information and idea swapping on AI, which is also really impressive with the Warhorse guys.We've been pretty busy with dogfighting, so this hasn't moved as quickly as I would have liked, because we had to sort out the legal documents to make sure we were protecting each other's IP, but we're ready to do that, and so we're in fact in meetings and talking about that stuff right now with Warhorse, I'll be going to one a little later on today.", "published_at": "2014-06-02", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 23.

I can't promise you that we'll be any more successful than some other people have been, but we definitely have a nice system that... Essentially you have to have server authorative to make sure that you're always watching everybody so they're not cheating.So we're a server authoriative model, which helps, but we have limited client trust. What happens is we let the client simulate, and the server also simulates, and as long as the client's close to where the server is, it's ok, and if it starts to deviate too much, we lose trust in the client, and the server starts to say \"No, you're here, you're here in this position.\"The nice thing about that is that the actual simulation locally, as long as you're not cheating, is generally really smooth, it feels like you're playing a single player game, because we don't wait for the server to tell us where we are, we just simulate locally, and as long as you're close enough by the time the server has looked at what your state is, then it's ok.So on a hack basis, since the server is really authorative and it's always checking stuff, we've got some other checks that are going on, it hopefully will help prevent some of the cheating that you can see, where people have their aimbots and all the rest of the stuff, but it's in the early days yet, and actually one of the interesting things about having the community and testing the stuff so early is. I'm assuming that we'll be able to see a lot of this stuff and address it and work on it before the full game is done and it's a full general public release.

So you can pull up the different systems on your ship and set them up for different power ratings and stuff like that.I would think that, the way we're doing the Mobiglas is augmented reality, so you would essentially pass the Mobiglas over your ship, then it highlights the hull outline around all the elements that you're thinking about.
