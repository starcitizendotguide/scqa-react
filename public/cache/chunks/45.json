A lifelong advocate of peace between Humans and aliens, Akari ran on a platform that promised to ease the tensions between Xi\u2019an and Humans on Terra. In 2789, anti-Messer activists smuggled him to the Tohil system, where he met with Emperor Kr.\u0113 to hammer out the details of the Akari-Kr.\u0113 Treaty. Akari was forced to go into hiding until the events of the Anti-Messer Revolution toppled the Imperator. When the new ImperatorErin Toi offered him a position as ambassador to the Xi\u2019an Empire, Akari chose instead to rejoin with the Senate and work to rebuild the UEE. He helped craft the Fair Chance Act, Military Reorganization Act of 2793, the Historical Truth Act, and many other key pieces of legislation that reshaped the UEE's government.

Could we expect to see a pledgeable capital ship, such as the new corvette, have its design influenced by those of the Covenant?", "answer": "Elwin Bachiller: That's a hard one to answer. I know for me, I try to keep my references as real-world as possible. We do have other spaceships that we look at as reference and inspiration as well, but we're definitely not sitting down and picking other ships from other universes and saying, \"We want this ship.\" It really comes down to the purpose - what is it that we're trying to accomplish with the personality of the vessel, what it's purpose is, and then we build from there. We may use small elements from other sci-fi universes that we've seen but we're definitely not sitting there saying, \"We need our version of exactly that ship.\" That doesn't happen.Lance Powell: To add additional information to the conversation. This isn't a direct response to the question but one of the things the design team is looking at is using frequencies of light. If you're using a red laser, you're going to have a longer band and it will have less impact. If you're using a green laser it will be somewhere in between. If you're using a blue laser, it will be a shorter frequency and far more damage. Everything in between, all of the various damage styles. The various range styles that come along with that. So, the complexity - it's being discussed right now to incorporate more real-world style future laser effects.I think things like neutron weapons, proton weapons, we're treating more like practical physics instead of traditional sci-fi. The weapon itself will provide - knock a couple of neutrons off of an atom and all of a sudden you've got an accumulation of something with extremely heavy mass. So, instead of it being a beam weapon... it is a beam weapon but it's like you got hit by a bus.", "title": "10 for the Artists: Episode 02 (2015.05.18)", "source": "https://youtu.be/shxj7XXKgr4", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Jack Cruise", "published_at_timestamp": 1431986585}, {"objectID": "571c283dbbf63_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "We can't offer too many additional details, but rest assured your fish will have a home In both the Gemini and standard Starfarer (unless you swap out the captain's quarters for another room!)", "published_at_timestamp": 1431468000, "question": "Can you go into any detail regarding the difference in the variants internals?

This is something we ran into when we first implemented the turrets in the Constellation for the gamescon livestream. When we were in the turret and the pilot is flying around in all 6 degrees, it was a huge pain in the ass to track your targets.Calix Reneau: I think it was about 4-5 days after getting the turrets working in the Constellation before someone got a kill using them.DT: As soon as Paul got a hold of it he said he had to change that right now. He actually passed that job off to Mark to do, but he got it working so that the view kinda tracked the world a little as best as was possible with the movement of the ship. Best example would probably be the Halo's warthog turret.

We meet over Skype we discuss what we're doing and we discuss ideas and those get kicked around. But then we also have, Chris will come up with ideas and tell us what his vision is, and then we'll carry that forward. We have a design council that kicks around ideas, and then we also have the players in the community - we constantly read the forums and listen to ideas that are coming from the players. So, it's a little bit of everything.TD: Yeah. I was gonna say, one thing I've observed at this company is like, way back in the day when I was starting in QA it was always kinda frowned upon to put in your suggestion bug, but I would say that this company is super open. Like, Chris especially is super open to QA feedback, and he's always trying to get QA reports, QA feedback. What's the balance like? What's the feel like? So, I think ideas come from all places.AM: I agree. I've always had that philosophy through my whole career - a good idea can come from anywhere. You don't have to just be a designer to have a great idea.Darian Vorlick: A lot of our stuff just comes organically anyway, and right in the middle of a meeting we're always like, \"you know what? Maybe we can tackle it this way instead?\" or \"We found that this didn't work, so why don't we come up with this type of missle, this type of gun.\" So, there is informal process to it.AM: Well, and there's just the process of playing the game itself.TD & DV: Yeah.AM: I mean, we have company-wide play tests where everybody jumps in and plays, and then afterwards they give feedback and from that feedback we come up with more ideas.[Everyone nodding in silence]TD: Killed it.AM: Alright.DV: Indeed.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 03 (2015.01.12)", "source": "https://youtu.be/EcnGeEBt3Go", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Juris Storm", "published_at_timestamp": 1421103656}, {"objectID": "373678900", "question": "What would happen to your Constellation if the whole crew got into the rover and somehow died planetside in the newly discovered and unreported sector?", "answer": "Heheh, well, I think you'd probably be dead, and then you would respawn back on the most recent friendly planet that you were on, with the fiction that the rescue crews went out there and found your almost dead, or almost lifeless bodies and managed to get you back.

They would not be jump capable. And then the short range fighter would depend... I mean, something like the Merlin, which is probably the example of the smallest and shortest range of one, really couldn't operate for that long outside of being re-docked back in the Constellation and refueled and rearmed. Some of the military short range or lighter fighters would obviously have a lot more range than that.

Specifically with the Warhorse stuff, they've got some very nice tech for how all their NPCs wear different outfits and clothes.They've got pre-computed morph stuff that takes the shirt and fits it to the body, then the chest plate if they have armor goes on top of that.So we're looking at using that to make our character modification pipeline smoother.I think we've talked to them, we've got some enhancements to the attachment system in CryEngine, which is a bit technical, but that's how you attach different things to a character or a body.We have a much more extendable and robust system than the default CryEngine, so we've talked about getting that, and then we're doing some information and idea swapping on AI, which is also really impressive with the Warhorse guys.We've been pretty busy with dogfighting, so this hasn't moved as quickly as I would have liked, because we had to sort out the legal documents to make sure we were protecting each other's IP, but we're ready to do that, and so we're in fact in meetings and talking about that stuff right now with Warhorse, I'll be going to one a little later on today.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 23.

I can't promise you that we'll be any more successful than some other people have been, but we definitely have a nice system that... Essentially you have to have server authorative to make sure that you're always watching everybody so they're not cheating.So we're a server authoriative model, which helps, but we have limited client trust. What happens is we let the client simulate, and the server also simulates, and as long as the client's close to where the server is, it's ok, and if it starts to deviate too much, we lose trust in the client, and the server starts to say \"No, you're here, you're here in this position.\"The nice thing about that is that the actual simulation locally, as long as you're not cheating, is generally really smooth, it feels like you're playing a single player game, because we don't wait for the server to tell us where we are, we just simulate locally, and as long as you're close enough by the time the server has looked at what your state is, then it's ok.So on a hack basis, since the server is really authorative and it's always checking stuff, we've got some other checks that are going on, it hopefully will help prevent some of the cheating that you can see, where people have their aimbots and all the rest of the stuff, but it's in the early days yet, and actually one of the interesting things about having the community and testing the stuff so early is. I'm assuming that we'll be able to see a lot of this stuff and address it and work on it before the full game is done and it's a full general public release. So hopefully we'll be in a better state, but it's early days, yeah, so who knows and that's a battle that I think will be waged for a long time.", "title": "10 for the Chairman Episode 19.

The Mobiglas will actually have a mode where you can essentially do what the holotable does, but on the Mobiglas.Then there's some other engineering kind of stuff, you can manage systems, and we were talking about having that happen on your Mobiglas. So you can pull up the different systems on your ship and set them up for different power ratings and stuff like that.I would think that, the way we're doing the Mobiglas is augmented reality, so you would essentially pass the Mobiglas over your ship, then it highlights the hull outline around all the elements that you're thinking about.
