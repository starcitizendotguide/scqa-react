Gareth adds that he sees the Designers being at the end of a funnel, trying to piece everything together to make something cohesive, where any single part could break, and that could seem like it's the fault of the mission when really the fault lies elsewhere (I imagine the box falling through a ship's cargo grid, for example, could be due to a bug with the cargo grid, or a de-sync with the server, or something like that). Despite all of that, it also doesn't mean that the missions are incapable of actually being broken, it's just that examples like the aforementioned disappearing box are not. Jared chimes in to say that all of the relevant teams are working very diligently to resolve these bugs and issues, that 3.6.1 is currently on the PTU in open testing, and so as the game becomes more stable and features are fleshed out more, the wonderful consequence of that will be that the missions will function better and thus Players will have more success in completing them.

Understandably, there will be the threat of pirates, but what other dangers will we run into, i.e., hitting a combustible methane vent will mining, or the consequences of a container malfunction during transport?", "answer": "TZ: This is actually one of my favourite ones because I like the concept of exploration, discovery and just as I\u2019m flying, going about my business, doing one thing maybe mining or whatever. I\u2019m encountered other stuff and so in terms of the things other than pirates that might kick you out quantum travel for a period of time, this would include everything from meteor showers, comets, derelict ships that cross your path, debris fields, micro black holes, just a variety of things like that. The most interesting aspect about this I think is that all these things that you encounter can not only have potential value to you even though you\u2019re currently engaged in something else because this represents information, if you cross paths with a comet and that comet\u2019s not known to anyone else you can actually sell that information that may be very valuable to somebody who actually wants to mine it.<br /><br />You start thinking about debris fields and derelict spaceships and those are very valuable to these guys that want engage in salvaging operations and micro black holes are very interesting to scientists that actually want to be able to study these things to extract value from them. So, you can see this whole circular ecosystem to where as you\u2019re going about your business you\u2019re encountering both directly and indirectly that can feed other parts of the economy. The other thing that I really, really like about this particular aspect is just the variety that it\u2019s going to bring when you start getting all these players interacting in all these different ways.<br /><br />CR: Yeah, I had else to say that the other things, well obviously we talked about mining potentially hitting a gas vent that can cause an explosion and those sort of things. Cargo and in general just transit we\u2026 besides things you can encounter, we very much have this high fidelity of simulation of various components of your ship and part of the big pink unicorn of Item 2.0 is the fact that we have age and wear and things will break down. So, that\u2019s not currently in the game as you guys are playing it but it\u2019s very much part of the systems that will be part when the full Item 2.0 comes online. Which means that under stress, being used a lot say in a long quantum drive like when you\u2019re on a trading cargo run or something, the items\u2026 you\u2019re powerplant, your engine, your thrusters, lights, whatever, they have aged, they can fail, they can misfire.<br /><br />So, there will definitely be a certain amount of maintenance keeping your ship running especially in the bigger ships. If you\u2019ve watched any science fiction movie and you\u2019ve seen Chewie banging the Millenium Falcon or the crew of the Nostromo having to keep their ship running and stuff like that. That is going to be a gameplay component besides just things that\u2026 you know, pirates you can run across and everything like that. We mentioned that with the real vast scale that we have in the game, we\u2019re not sort of compressing the star systems the way a lot of other space games have. I mean we are compressing it because if we went full real scale then it would take way, way longer for people to travel across one solar system than I think people would enjoy but we are still having a massive amount of scale. Much more so than other games will have and therefore when you\u2019re in quantum drive at 0.2 speed of light, which is very fast you theoretically could spend half an hour to go from one side of the star system to another side of the star system.<br /><br />Now likelihood is you\u2019ll never be in quantum drive for that long because you\u2019ll be pulled out for some reason or there\u2019ll be something in the way but you could quite easily be in quantum drive for a few minutes, 5 minutes or whatever, 10 minutes and part of we don\u2019t want you to be bored so you\u2019re running around. There will be things for you to do to keep your ship running while you\u2019re doing that, so it\u2019s sort of like travel gameplay and that will be one of the parts of being a long distance explorer or cargo hauler where you\u2019ll actually have things to do like you would if you were a sea captain on a container ship crossing the Atlantic ocean or the Pacific.<br /><br />TZ: You mentioned boredom and that kind of goes back to that sense of discovery I was talking about. We don\u2019t want these things that pull you out of quantum travel to always be viewed, if you\u2019re currently doing something else, as an annoyance. We actually want make these things indirectly entice players to occasionally break off what they\u2019re doing and explore a little bit more. There\u2019s a variety of ways by which we can do that if you think about I\u2019m currently mining and I\u2019ve basically loaded up my ship with ore and I\u2019m heading over the refinery and all of the sudden you\u2019re kicked out of quantum travel, and you got a ping on your radar and all you know is at this distance is that it\u2019s a ship and at conventional cruise speeds it\u2019s three minutes away.<br /><br />Do you now start spooling up your quantum engines after you\u2019ve course corrected to get around it and you\u2019re going to go ahead and jump out but the information that there\u2019s a derelict ship there when you don\u2019t know anything about it, its current state, whether it\u2019s already been salvaged, what type of ship it is\u2026 that information is worth much less. Or do you go off the beaten path and now you\u2019re actually going to invest three minutes to go\u2026 you were mining but it seems safe, so I\u2019m going to head over and I\u2019m going to get a little bit closer. Now I know what type of ship it is, I\u2019m going to go a little bit closer still, now I can actually see it hasn\u2019t actually been scrapped.<br /><br />There\u2019s a lot of value here, this key that I have is now very extraordinarily valuable when I go to sell that information to someone else but I got a little bit too close and it turns out there\u2019s already some other people. You know pirates that have pulled up or scrappers and they don\u2019t want anyone else to have this information so they\u2019re moving to basically take you out so can\u2019t alert other players and bring them there. All of the sudden you wanted to extract a little bit value about something you incidentally ran into and you ventured a little bit too closer and now you\u2019ve basically walked into\u2026 not something that was intentionally meant as a trap but it works out that way none the less.<br /><br />CR: Yup, when a lot of this stuff is working we have a much bigger play field which is in the off thing, that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on right now. I think the gameplay possibilities and fun going to be much better\u2026 well, I mean much better than it is now.

I had the idea when I saw the first video of Star Citizen featuring the Bengal, and then the Top Gun homage sealed it.

I've had a couple of conversations with design so it's something that's interesting and maybe we'll be able to do it but we still have to work out some of the details of it. It's a really fun idea using capital ships that way as the rings to race through.I'm not sure that ships themselves will allow that. And also different forms of racing too that we've talked about right now most of the racing is done with very fast ships but getting in the larger ships imagine a couple of Hull-E's racing around that would be really funny.

So I think with the excess of other projects going on to there's less of a focus on doing those types of stories at the moment, *WW Interrupts*  AW: Yeah go aheadWill Weissbaum: Of course were still you know releasing the jump points serial stories every month to subscribers so we haven't gotten rid of it completely, it's still something that we really enjoy reading ourselves and engaging in and providing as a benefit to the subscribers.

It depends on the job. With your experience if it makes sense would you be able to jump right in and get a producer level role at some company? Maybe not, right? But the fact that you've got project experience, right? That you've done projects in some form or fashion. That you can speak intelligently about how you got that project from the beginning to the end. Those are great traits, they're skills you learned that we use every day that will help you in this environment. Would maybe a production assistant or coordinator role or even a associate producer role at certain companies make more sense? Probably, right? But it definitely wouldn't... there's no specific degree that would get anyone any higher than the life experience you would bring to the role itself.DV: It's one of the industries that I've seen is a very even playing field. That oftentimes it's what you know not necessarily where you went to school.EKD: Yup, absolutely, absolutely.DV: Let's look at Blizzard. How many producers, how many senior producers did we know that never even went to college.EKD: Sure, absolutely.DV: One of them was like an air conditioning repairman. One just worked at dot com sales. They eventually became senior and lead producers.EKD: Yep. It's a very young industry. So we still have a lot of... we don't necessarily have a full degree program out there. I think they're starting to pop up more for games. But we don't.. most of the leaders of the industry don't necessarily come from a games school focused background, right? They got into the industry, they loved it, they worked their way up. They learned the industry. They want to make the industry better. And so I think all that kinda combined, yeah you could totally get a role within some kind of producer role at some kind of game studio. I don't see why not.DV: I am gonna actually add something, just as a little nod to Alex Mayberry. Something he told me back when we were at Blizzard.EKD: Yeah.DV: If you're looking to get into production. Don't look at it from the perspective of, \"Well I am not an artist, I am not a programmer, I am not a designer, I am not an engineer, so what's left for me? I think I'll try production.\" That is the wrong reason to get into production. you have to have a very dedicated love for it. You have to love looking at spreadsheets, keeping things organized. Now you with a military background, that would obviously... having that discipline would help greatly. But it's something that you have to have a passion for. If you're someone who just went by default, \"Because I can't do anything else in the industry, I might as well get into production.\" I've historically seen a lot of people who go that route tend to have a lot more trouble within the industry. So find some.. If you just want to get into the industry, pursue a course that you want to. If you want to be a designer, start designing mods for different games, things like that.

Would there be a size 5 sensor cluster I could put on the nose of my Avenger instead of a size 5 cannon to go exploring with instead of interdicting?", "answer": "Travis Day: My favorite part of this question is the idea of a size 5 cannon on the Avenger. Spoiler alert! It's not gonna stay a size 5. It looks RIDICULOUS when you put one of the size 5 guns on there. So how robust is the plug-and-play system for ship pipes? That's a great question, 'cause I love answering, \"it's very robust!\" Basically the item pipes are something that flow between all the nodes on the ship. They carry CPU power, they carry \"power power\", and they carry heat. The pipe system then references the data points for each of the XMLs which define what that item either contributes or removes from the pipe system, and then that flows into the pipe system organically based on the setup of the ship. So you can, if what you're asking is, attach a soda can [holds up soda can] to your class 1 hardpoint - and maybe it's aluminum so it vents heat - versus putting a weapon on there. As long as they can accommodate the size of the can, the size of the weapon, anything can be attached anywhere, and it can work in that slot, and it will update the pipes dynamically as it's all a data-driven system. That's something that's super important to Chris was making sure it was a data-driven system, so we could do just that. So you asked specifically about putting a size 5 sensor cluster onto your Avenger instead of a size 5 cannon - so, \"yes\" would be the answer, as long as the hardpoint supports that size, you would have a gimballing sensor. Because, you know, what could make a sensor better? Gimbals!Darian Vorlick: But a key thing to remember is that, the sizes-... we want to make sure that any size mount that we put on a ship is going to at least try to adhere to some modicum of game balance. So we may adjust the sizes as we see fit, to maintain balance, but we also want to maintain a certain level of aesthetics. So if we find that a mount is either too large or too small for a particular ship we may take it down a peg or bring it up one.TD: Yeah, so maybe rather than managing a size 5 sensor cluster, it's a size 2 sensor cluster.

We'd like to be able to get between 50 and 100 if we possibly could do that, but we're still a ways off right now. I mean right now we have much above 12 players in Arena Commander and we're starting to have some performance issue, but there's a lot of optimization that we need to do to address, to fix, and... we're also sort of working on some of the back-end net code with things called like \"dead reckoning\" and stuff that will greatly reduce the amount of data. So it will make all of this easier to have a large amount of players in the system. But it's probably not likely to be more than about 50 to 100 in any one area instance. Now in the actual star system itself, it's sort of built in a way that it can handle tens of thousands of players in that star system - it's just not tens of thousands of players would all be able to see each other at the same time. They would just be stacked in different instances, and then we put you in, like in your local area, sort of based on who your friends are, who your enemies are, what your game preferences are, and it's sort of dynamically putting you in and out of instances as you fly around. So to you it should mostly feel like you're in a big universe and you run across a lot of people, because you literally, if you're flying from one planet to another planet, you may move in and out of 4 or 5 different instances. And so potentially means that you could be... outside of the NPCs... you potentially could be seeing 200-300 players when you're doing that (if it was a really busy populated area).So I think our system hopefully would work quite well. Most certainly will not be any equivalent of the Eve several-thousand-players-all-in-one-big-space-battle, just because with the detail and fidelity that we have on our ships we just can't simulate that many... I mean none of the computers that we have - even our most fastest expensive one with the most ridiculous graphics chip could handle it and kinda what we're doing.

So we're looking at being able to do that on a tablet where you could put one of the VDU's from your cockpit to that. We're also, I think it would be interesting to explore it on a multiple monitor situation. Although when I've talked about this, to be sure, this won't be functional in the dogfighting, and it's a longer term goal for the game. The idea would be we'd have some of that when the game is fully done. So maybe it would roll out as part of the dogfighting as it improves over time, but not at the beginning. But yeah, we would like to do that support, we think it would be great.", "published_at": "2014-02-07", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 02 (2013.12.13)", "source": "https://youtu.be/qwbU9FG5XlQ", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Premium Kabanu", "published_at_timestamp": 1391813687}, {"objectID": "16557521dac5fc_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Will pledge ships and items be transferable in the game?
