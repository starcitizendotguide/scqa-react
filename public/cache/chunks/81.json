There's a lot of variables that come into it but really ... really every ship is a bit different. Every ship is its own puzzle you need to solve. And your general goal is to get them down to roughly the same level. So what I mean by that is at least just in terms of level of detail, when the model slowly disappears we'll focus on that. That's really important. That saves a lot of performance.When you are up close to someone, you see the ship: it has all of its internal stuff, all of its external stuff. All that full detail stuff, right? But when you are far away, you may not realise by you are not rendering all that stuff. Like things get culled: the interior might disappear, the model might degrade in quality a bit. Not noticeable. That's where it comes down to. Things like that are where we come in and we look at the statistics and we say \"How is this performing? How many ships can we have in an area? How much detail can we get at various ranges?\" And then we just optimise from there.I mean for a specific number? Really there's not specific number of assets or ... it's just like, you know, whatever people's computers can really handle based on what we use to work with.Elwin Bachiller: Yeah. I mean the beauty of having this game run on a PC is that the more power you have, the more of the beautiful visuals you can have rendering at the same time.PS: Yes.EB: So part of it is hardware related, but obviously we're trying to optimise as much as possible to make the game run as smooth as possible for as many people as possible.PS: Yes.

Do you prioritize all those things on a daily or weekly basis?", "answer": "Jake Ross: Yeah, there are a lot of requests that come in from Chris and Tony for all kinds of things and speaking for Tony...Tony's general philosophy he's told me several times is that he really only has a 12 month horizon meaning that he only really cares at any given moment about what's on the horizon for the next 12 months, what's on the schedule for that time. It makes things a little easier to manage on my side since the amount of content in the game planned right now takes us well beyond 12 months from now. Things that don't fall in the next 12 months usually fall into a backlog for later review, things aren't falling through the cracks or anything, we document everything and make sure it goes into a backlog. That backlog grows, grows and grows but 12 months everytime something gets finished or completed we pull something else out. That's kinda how a backlog works.Jason Hutchins: There's never a shortage of good ideas.JR: No, never and a lot of those good ideas come from the community so thanks. As far as keeping track of the features goes...usually it's a matter of just pulling features from the backlog, producers gathering estimates and dependencies for those features from the lead. A lot of times it's a relationship between the producer and the lead talking about a feature figuring out what's required, how we break this down into individual tasks and then taking those tasks and documenting them in our task tracking software. We use JIRA here. That's kind of how that whole process works for me at least.JH: Also, as I mentioned earlier, our new focus will be looking at the backlog to see what features are needed for the Persistent Universe and Squadron 42 so we can focus on Star Citizen as a holistic product. If something is Persistent Universe only, it'll probably go back to the backlog for the year for the next time we review the backlog. We'll build those features for the Persistent Universe as we get closer to rolling those features out and rolling out different patches for the Persistent Universe.So basically, if Squadron 42 needs something that is also beneficial for the PU, those things will get prioritized higher than something that's only beneficial for the PU.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 13", "source": "https://youtu.be/jo85N7P5UeQ", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Doc", "published_at_timestamp": 1448321458}, {"objectID": "373680480", "question": "Okay, I'll try a more serious question. I'm a programmer that works on bespoke business apps and I use Jira at work. How do you guys use Jira? Is it the \"source of truth\" for tracking what people are working on and how completely they feel it is, what's assigned to them but unstarted, etc. Have you modified the workflow and statuses to better represent the ship pipeline, for example? Or is it all spreadsheets? :)While I'd love to hear about this, I can see where showing screenshots like cardwalls would be great in help explaining but perhaps more info than we can handle.", "answer": "Eric Kieron Davis: You already said it, if it's not in Jira it doesn't exist, that is definitely a methodology that we're not only adopting but utilizing more and more everyday. Jira definitely is becoming more of our production tools and were trying to encourage people to keep the statuses up to date because it does help communicate accross studio about the status, when things are being delivered and how much work is left.If you've ever done any project management you know if you can build a backlog as realistic and thorough and good bids, the better because you can now go okay it will take me an hour to sit down and tell you exactly how thing this is going to take to get done. Now that's usually is at like darian said at the beginning, when you start off with that it's usually when you got into battle the moment you start the project, it all changes and you got to keep it up to date, but at least you start with it and you can start getting estimates, you can see how long things are going to take, you can see the resources you need.We are at the start of that with our leads. Our leads go, we get our vision, the leads break it down, the producers put that all together. We look at what that means for us and we get the realities together and I think Jira, the point of Jira is to collect all that information as much as you can so when you look at something like 1.3.0, when we want to deliver it. We constantly look at what's left, what's the big blockers, what's trivial, what really won't break anything, what will keep things moving and we can make quick decisions faster.Darian Vorlick: So we can bump it to the next version.EKD: So on and so forth, So if it's not in Jira it doesn't exist that's kind of because our Mantra, and we're doing our best to maintain that as our database.DV: It also helps with accountability. So for example if someone starts working on a task that's not in Jira, how do we account for how much time was spent on it, is it a feature we actually needed in the first place, so by having everyone working through Jira on specific tasks,we create a paper trail on what's been worked on, how long people have spent on it, how long it's taken, how much time is left to complete it. It gives the production team the roadmap that we can provide that information whether it's to you guys on how soon we are presenting something, it lets us tell the other team here where we're at where are you guys, okay cool let's work together on this and let's see what we can come up with.EKD: Absolutely and any sort of tracking tools. it's only as good as the people that use it, and it's only as good as the people that keep it up to date. If the goal for someone is to say, hey what is calix working on, What does it say in Jira, in search oh he's working on this, it says in progress is that right? Yup, Great! Not only have you sped up communication, you've made it efficient for someone to go oh Calix can't work on that because he has this this and this or we can say that's not the priority anymore, we're shifting to this because of a certain release. It makes us, makes decisions quicker.DV: Or you know Zane suddenly decided one day, \"I'm gonna make a 3D environment for the capital class ship HUD system\" and that's not on his task list and we see him working on that we're like zane, were getting close a deadline here, that's really awesome but let's get that into the schedule but right now our crunch time because we have this this and this, this is what the needs of the product are right now. Now as far what workflows, we've modified and it's all spreadsheets. I spent a lot of time in Excel, I'm an Excel guy, I love using Excel.EKD: And I don't think you'll ever get out of Excel. Excel is a great tool for scenario building and planning and you can move things around quicker until you have all the data, you can make more assumptions with Excel than you can with Jira: Jira needs actual data.DV: And we've been playing around with Microsoft Project.EKD: Yup!DV: Shotgun!EKD: Yup, a lot of good production tools that are all kind of working together.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 12", "source": "https://youtu.be/jx2NSZOGNqE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "TGWS/Bennu", "published_at_timestamp": 1445896605}, {"objectID": "373681290", "question": "For the science/research curious of us.

So, we're consulting with real astrophysicists to try and flesh out the rest of... some of the science and the physics of the fiction, the universe, and the planets.  So, we're definitely doing that.  Tony is very keen on having quite a bit of scientific research and realism so we actually have some dedicated ships &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; we have the Endeavor that's coming up which will be its own science platform.  We have a variant of the Reliant that will be more of a science/research based vessel.  We have a few other things where there will be non-combat-based gameplay.  So, one obviously is exploring and charting areas but another one will be actually analyzing &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; basically like getting on the tail of a comet and figuring out what the composition of the comet is when you're following behind it and then later on you can maybe &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; based on that, you take that data back to the UEE and sell that for money.So, we're going to have various parts of gameplay that involve science and research whether it's researching stuff down on planets or in asteroid fields or things like comets as I mentioned.  Obviously we sort of have a science fiction universe so there's a certain amount of fantasy elements to the science fiction because if it was hardcore science, probably in 2900 it wouldn't look exactly the way it does in Star Citizen.

How has this influenced the interior and/or exterior design of the ships which you create?", "answer": "Elwin Bachiller: So, it influences both the interior and exterior, in different ways.  So, smaller ships that don't really have interior spaces, the components that the ship carries influences directly the shape of the ships.  So, the bigger a component, the larger that section of the ship has to be in order to house the component.  So, good ships to look at that would have that would be the Hornet, the 300i, the upcoming new version of the Merlin, basically we have to shape the hsip to make sure that it can house all the components that its' supposed to house.  So that's the exterior.  For the interior, it depends on what components are going to be accessible to the player from the interior so, lets say for example something happens to your powerplant and you're on a Constellation for example, there's a space inside the Constellation where the player can go and interact with that object, which means we have to create a hallway that's wide enough for the player to go into, that we have panels that open up and there's enough clearance space and things like that, so the spaces will change in size depending on the things you interact with.  So all the components will shape the ships in every way.Lance Powell: So I can't help but notice you had a little gleam in your eyes when you mentioned the Merlin.  Can you talk about that ship and specifically where you started, and how you got to where you are with those volumes, keeping those volumes in mind?EB: Sure, so, getting the concept model of the Merlin, which I think is what's in Arena Commander right now, that's actually the concept model, that's not the final one, so I had to sit down and get all the components that the Merlin's supposed to house, get all proper sizes for them and then plop them into the ship, and then realize that none of them actually fits correctly, which means i have to go through a process of changing the shapes, making certain sections fatter, certain sections thinner, to make sure it all fits, and then once that's done I have to go through a pass of actually finessing the shapes, making sure it communicates the right personality and things like that, so I use, lets say, a Mustang or traditional muscle cars as inspiration for that, on top of making sure that all the components work, so yeah, we went through a lot of pains to make sure that functions, cause the Merlin is an incredibly small ship.

Because, I'm sure when we get the game live and we have multicrew going... we're going to get all the users spawn, everyone get out of their ships, and see how many people they can cram into each ship kind of like a clown car. In terms of the number of people aboard the ship, I'm not sure we're going to be limiting it beyond what the game servers can handle, and of course in our game server situation we still haven't determined how many we can have on one particular game server but of course we'll save slots for your friends, for your enemies, for your people of interest, for some other people just flying around in the area so if you say we could fit 50 people or 100 people in one game instance, it's unlikely we would let you fit 50 or 100 of them all being your friends. So, then the real question is if all 50 of them could squeeze into the Redeemer, which they probably couldn't, what would you do? Would you fly off somewhere? Could the Redeemer fly off somewhere? Or, would you not fly until you're down to the actual crew payload. I think our rule would be: the people who can get onboard are onboard. It probably won't block you from being able to fly around, maybe it will block you from going through a jump point. We haven't really figured out the restriction quotient for people onboard ships. Out of the gate, we'll put the system up there and we probably won't restrict it and then we'll see what happens and manage it from there.But, the ideas of life support and C02 levels are really great in-fiction ways to manage the number of crew and guests you have on a ship, so thanks for the suggestion!", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 54 (2015.02.23)", "source": "https://youtu.be/ONq34ospaJM", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Captain Jackson", "published_at_timestamp": 1424732404}, {"objectID": "373676890", "question": "Will there be missions designed for more than one ship?

You can actually listen to that. Some of it, I think, I want to say some of it's sped up, or slowed down, I can't remember...TD: Is it like-... Is he right? It is like radio frequencies?DV: Yes. If I'm-... I don't want to misrepresent it, or misstate it, but I want to say yes.TD: Okay! Ah, that's interesting, yeah...DV: On top of that... well you have-... That's why radio-based astronomy is so big. Radio telescopes. So we can listen to sound from, like, pulsars.

I did not know that.DV: It's how we listen to some of the most distant objects in our universe is basically picking up what those sound patterns are, and they're really cool to listen to.

I was thinking like an old man with one of those ear cones.DV: Actually I just thought about something. Did you ever read the book, or see the movie \"Contact\"?TD: Yeah!DV: So, did you read the book?TD: No.DV: So, the movie actually had almost nothing to do with the book. Where the movie was about religion versus science, the novel itself (which is why it's my favorite Carl Sagan novel) was about transcendental numbers - numbers like pi. About how there's no end - it's a perpetual number that never has the same pattern repeating once. But in the novel, if you went far down enough into those numbers, they actually started seeing patterns emerge, which is where they got the plans for that giant structure. So how do you have something that's so fundamental to the laws of the universe have a pattern for designs of a space tunnel, and a spaceship? While that was a lot of creative license and there's no actual pattern found in those numbers, it would be interesting, as a hidden Easter egg in the game.

I don't care what anyone else says, I'm pretty confident we are. And then it's really just a matter of the control input, and how that's translated into the computer that's controlling the flight. And you know, we're trying to make the game inclusive for a large amount of people.So the goal with the game is to make it pretty easy to pick up and play, and then as you get deeper into it, there's a lot of dials and knobs you can turn to make the dogfighting more interesting or give you an edge over another player who isn't as experienced.I always liken it to StarCraft or StarCraft II where you can just go around with a mouse and point and click and build units and fight people, but until you really know the rock, paper, scissors of all the units and you know every keyboard shortcut, it's pretty hard for you to compete with someone who's more experienced. And I definitely think that's going to be the case in Star Citizen.I've already noticed in a lot of the forum threads, and I talked about this last week in the post where we were talking about the flight model and everything, that there's a lot of people who in the beginning weren't used to what we're trying to do, because all past flight sims, including a lot of the present ones, go with a very simplified atmospheric model and then add some \"space\" trappings like I can go up or down or left or right, but they don't really simulate it to the level that we do, where we actually add... Every item has its own mass and gets added to the ship and changes the moment of inertia and the thrusters gimbal to fire at the specified directions, and actually apply thrust which changes the inertia, angular or linear, of that ship.So we're not doing any cheating and just saying all this sudden we rotate by 15&Acirc;&deg; or 20&Acirc;&deg;, it all comes out of the simulation, and that gives you a much higher level of fidelity, and also a difference in feel of ships. Maybe ships that would weigh the same and have the same class of engines, if one is more compact than another, then at that point it will actually feel different, it will rotate different at different speeds 'cause it has a different angular momentum, not angular momentum, inertia.So I definitely don't feel that we're arcadey, I do think that in every space game or space sim, you have to make some level of... You've got to make a call about what's fun and what isn't fun. Generally space combat in my mind would not be anything like the way it is in Arena Commander or any other space game you play because it would probably all be done by computers, well beyond visual range, and it would be about who's computer processes fast enough to create a firing solution.But we don't like that, we like to get on the tail and shoot people down and see the ships, and I definitely feel that Arena Commander does a good job of that.Are there things that can be improved? Absolutely, and that's what we're working on. We're gonna make it better with everyone's help and feedback out there, but I think, as far as a sim goes, we're probably more sim than pretty much everything out there.I mean besides just the physics of it all and the flight model, the ship itself, all the systems in it are individual systems that plug into that ship, and they all interconnect through power pipes and heat pipes and the CPU pipe, and the fuel pipe, which takes the fuel from the fuel tank to the thrusters and all that stuff. And they all interconnect, and if one fails, it can effect the other ones.Say if your power plant goes down or it gets damaged and reduces its power output, then everything that draws power from it may or may not operate or may operate at less functionality.It's all very system based. A lot of things should just fall out of it like a part of your ship gets ripped out with several systems on it, they're gone. So all this sudden if other parts of the ship required that system, whether it was a power plant or a heat sink or something like that, they won't function. But we don't have any codes \"if wing is blown off do this,\" it all just falls out of the system.So I would say we're probably pretty sim-ish, and then the aspect is is it your definition of what you think is a sim, and I think it's gonna be so many people in this game, there's so many different takes on it, it's almost impossible to please everybody. I think in the long run if people stick with it, 'cause don't forget this isn't just about dogfighting, which is Arena Commander. Even right now the multiplayer dogfighting; team mode I think should be open to most people by now, but up until now, the team mode hasn't even been open to people. So you just watch people go in and it's a furball.Of course if two people are fighting and not looking at you, of course you can come in and start shooting at them and they're not going to be able to see you.So it's not really a good indicator of what the combat's really gonna be like long term in the universe, 'cause the Arena Commander combat's much more, ultimately, set to be fast paced than I think the final combat will be in the universe when you're out there for real, 'cause that has a lot more to do with your radar, and your signatures, and a whole bunch of other stuff that you would manage, and you would have a way's to go before you got to contact with someone who you were fighting, and so there's a bunch more that happens.Arena Commander's really the first pass to get out to the straight out there, rough and tumble fighting, work on the control inputs and the flight models, and a bunch of the little stuff that we need to balance.The ultimate game is gonna have so much more and we've built so much of systems in to allow it to do that. I think the potential's immense, and I think people are gonna have a lot of fun, beyond just dogfighting. Smuggling, or trading, or all the rest of the stuff.So alright, there you are. I don't know if that answered the question about it being a sim, but anyway, there you go.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 26.

In general if they're in various instances around the system, they're really always going to be in a ring or some broken up ring around the central star.But there will definitely be pockets of asteroid fields around the system. So I guess the answer on this one would be both, but there will definitely be some localized debris fields where you'll find debris and some other stuff in the various systems. I don't know if I answered that question very well, but I guess it will be kind of like Freelancer and kind of like other things. There you go.", "title": "10 for the Chairman Episode 18.

Longer term we've been toying around with doing some sort of linear content that would enhance the game experience. Where there potentially would be character that would... Like Kid Crimson's a good example that we had back on our website a while ago, and he'd be a great character to run around the universe. It would be great to have his stories, but not just be written in text, but actually visually see them in the environments of the world, and then occasionally in the game run across the Kid Crimson character.So that's kind of what we're thinking. That's obviously down the road, it's game first, and then segue to that, but we'd probably want to try and do it in a holistic manner so it works with the whole universe.We wouldn't really want to license it out somewhere, and we'd probably want to use a lot of our assets. So if we were gonna do it, we're not sure whether it would be all digital characters, or whether it would be actors against green screen, and then the rest would be the universe of Star Citizen using incredibly detailed environments and ships and all the rest of the stuff.That would be down the road, but we think there could be some great potential there. Obviously there's a lot of stuff out there that people like, and I think people, for anything, if the story and the universe connects enough, I think people like to experience it in more than one manner. I certainly have myself for something like Star Wars.So longer term, that's something we would consider, but short term, heads down just building the universe in the first place and getting the game out there.", "title": "10 for the Chairman - Episode 14 .

If you want to call it \"warp speed,\" which is sort of what we're calling our 0.2c, basically 1/5 the speed of light.In that case you basically would be just accelerating up to that speed and then decelerating over a period of time. And our fiction in our world is one of the reasons you always drop out of \"warp\" whenever you come near other ships or near other celestial bodies is because at that level of speed you actually can't really deviate your trajectory too much over a short period of time without creating a huge amount of force on your body. So likely you won't be able to avoid a collision. So your Intelligent Flight Control, warp, whatever, is scanning way ahead and goes:\"Ok look I've got an object way off in the distance, I've got to decelerate me and drop me out of this warp.\"And that's sort of the mechanical, in fiction, reason for why you get pulled out of warp or autopilot when you're going between distances.So in terms of the instancing, I guess you drop in and out based on whether there are other ships there and also whether there's planets, and then I'm also toying with the idea of you being able to run away.So you basically just keep accelerating. So you sort of go faster than your Intelligent Flight Control system lets you do for dogfighting, but the downside is if you keep accelerating, the ship will not let you do much deviation and turning.So if I'm trying to flee a battle, and I go fast, yes I'm going fast, but if someone gets on my tail he has pretty much a free shot. Generally things like laser bolts and missiles will have higher top speed, obviously laser bolts definitely, but missiles even could have a higher level of acceleration to catch up with you faster. So you're opening yourself up to some shots as you flee away, as you start to try and get fast enough away before you can make the jump to \"warp speed\" so to speak.So anyway, I hope that helps out a little bit, but that's how we're thinking, we're still gonna be playing with it.We'll be updating you on how those mechanics will work in the game as we get to them in the Persistent Universe as well as the dogfighting stuff. Because the dogfighting stuff is all going to be pretty limited, but this is more questions involving the Persistent Universe.Can you flee from the battle? How quickly can you flee?

But it\u2019s cool, I like it. I backed Elite Dangerous a while ago. I actually bought X: Rebirth when it came out and No Man\u2019s Sky looks really interesting.<br/><br/>I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to be like\u2026there\u2019s always sort of these fan boy arguments like \u201cThis is better than that\u201d like the classic PS vs. Xbox argument. For me, it\u2019s more the merrier. I mean I had my biggest successes in the 90\u2019s where Lucas Arts was going head to head with me with Tie Fighter and X Wing and my sales didn\u2019t decrease. I thought it was good because honestly seeing other people do stuff spurs you on and makes you want to make your own game better.<br/><br/>So I think friendly competition is good. I\u2019m pretty interested in trying some of the games which use procedurally generated content like No Man\u2019s Sky. People don\u2019t think of Star Citizen as being a procedural game but we are using that hand-crafted approach and the procedural approach. It\u2019s the only way we can fill the universe.

So you have to remember that the game today is gonna be a lot less optimized than the final game will be because right now we focus on some of the core functionality and features and not so much on the optimization. Although we are doing some R&D into something that we think will give us a big performance gain, merge instancing, a bunch of our meshes, and then also we're gonna be supporting Mantle which will really help with the draw call count and efficiency that you get from Direct X. So I would basically say if you can run the hangar really well with some big ships and all the rest of the stuff and the Dogfighting Module really well, then you probably will be able to run the final game pretty well. Now I definitely would like Star Citizen to be one of those games that gets bench-marked in all those PC GPU tests, so that is one of our goals.
