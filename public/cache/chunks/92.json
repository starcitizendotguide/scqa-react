Our predicted internal roadmap for icache wasn't communicated outward and now this is being directly quoted as some kind of guaranteed delivery date, which it never was, just an internal predicted estimate at that time.<br/><br/>To answer your question \"what happened?\" Well a few things:<ol><li>There ended up being some discovered work along the way in order to both deliver on the goals of icache/global persistence, while also setting us up for server meshing. Without going into too many details, for example we have filled out more of the design of icache to scale better by allowing us to query on data in a way that leverages the shard aggregation of the data. Additionally we've laid out some more ambitious plans to deal with some inventory design work to set us up for planned features like the separation of players and characters (death of a spaceman kind of stuff), and to support additional design asks for things like physical inventory and cargo. There's more, but you get the idea.</li><li>Some resources have been borrowed away from icache work here and there for things like the Long Term Persistence (LTP) implementation and support and some vital internal engine work to support the team. This hasn't been a huge amount but it did impact the schedule.</li><li>We increased the amount of internal testing we are planning for the feature set, and increased the amount of time dedicated to tooling for debugging so that we have more confidence when it goes live for the initial release. This is an incredibly deep set of changes to the game and backend, rushing it out is to the benefit of no one.</li></ol><br/>In the last video I did I said the icache service fleet was largely done and most of the work is focused on integrating it into the game engine and updating all the game systems accordingly.

Luke and \"Koda\" (unclear who this is) looked at the design and tried to simplify it into something that could be delivered quickly and easily, and earlier this week they managed to \"get something\" that was really promising. Ed Fuller (Luke's Principle Designer - unsure on the spelling of their name) did an audit of all of their missions which he finished on Friday, coming to the conclusion that most of them would be easy to refactor (to allow for mission-sharing), but others like race missions might need some work. For example, if you shared a race mission with everyone, only the mission owner can pass through the checkpoints, otherwise the other people it was shared with could be at the other checkpoints and instantly finish the mission. Basically, some missions have edge-cases that they have to catch, but even so they were able, on Wednesday, to share a delivery mission. Some things didn't work, but over the course of 2 days they were able to get that up and running. Luke can't say when exactly it'll be released, but thinks instead that it'll be rolled out mission-by-mission as they convert them into this new shareable version. He adds that it's very promising and they were very happy with it on Wednesday. Gareth comments on the refactors that they have to do, which prompts Luke to talk about one such refactor of the missions, which is to facilitate Server-Side Object Container Streaming. He says \"with server streaming on it's night and day\", with similar gains as were seen with the introduction of Client-Side Object Container Streaming. Whilst this is great, it also requires a lot of work to be done in refactoring the missions to work with SSOCS, whereas this refactor which allows for missions to be shared is really beneficial and will make people happy (I think what they're saying here is that the refactoring work for SSOCS isn't directly beneficial for Players, and it's that directly beneficial work they'd rather be doing). Jared then uses this opportunity to talk about why we don't have more missions, or more missions of different types, and a few other things (I didn't feel like much of it was relevant to this question, rather just \"heading-off\" people who might make certain complaints about certain things.

A major one is that we kind of now have this pipeline down where the concept artists are in sync with the tech designers and everyone else and a ship can very seamless can go from one to the other, to the other and come out the other end. Which you're seeing a lot with some of the smaller ships: The Sabre was finished very quickly, the Buccaneer is going to go right into active development I believe, that's the schedule as of today, that may change tomorrow.Another big aspect is the kits and the style sheets they built for the different manufactures. You probably noticed that when we did 2.0, you saw a lot of Aegis and MISC ships because those are the ships that have their pipelines pretty much completed and now you're seeing a whole bunch of Drake ships. We're finishing up the Herald, we're doing the Buccaneer, working on the Caterpillar. There's rhyme behind it, I know people are like \"We want to see the Banu Merchantman now, we want to see the Banu Merchantman now\", I want to see the Banu Merchantman now, but we need to take time to build the Banu aesthetic, we need to do it right rather than right now.So the other ships time will come, they're all scheduled out on the production pipeline now. I will also mention now that Prowler was one of the ones mentioned as going into production. We're still in concept on that one, it'll be a bit longer for exactly the same reason until you see it. We need to build the Tevarin race first and we want to do that right.", "published_at": "2016-05-30", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 12", "source": "https://youtu.be/Iydp3X56hpk", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Ethnine", "published_at_timestamp": 1464634147}, {"objectID": "373674550", "question": "I have recently bought a ship bundle pack (Combo War Pack), but unfortunately I discovered that I can only use 5 hangar bays, so I can't have all my ships out at once, even close to all of them. Will the hangars be able to be made bigger in time, or will renting extra hangar space be an in game feature?", "answer": "Longer-term absolutely being able to rent and get bigger hangar space will be something that we will have as a game feature. Also, I think, depending on how you play, you may actually want to have some of your ships in various areas around the universe, depending, I mean, obviously, we just have the Stanton system, there isn't as much need for that as possible.But as you can already see, there's different kinds of gameplay based on different kinds of ships, so like Hornet is great for dogfighting but it's really- well it can't carry cargo, so you may need a cargo ship &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Starfarer or a Hull C or a D, you may also want to go and do a mercenary mission and that may even mean that you want to take a Hornet or something like that with it. So the idea- maybe there's some missions or adventures that you want to do on one side of the known UEE universe and maybe there's some stuff you want to do over here.I could definitely see at the point where you've acquired a fair amount of wealth in the game and a fair amount of ships that you may actually have &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; just like rich people in the world do now, they have houses in different cities &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; I think you could potentially own hangars in different planets with some of the ships you have, so depending on where you are you'll always have somewhere you can go quickly to switch out a ship &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; because you're only going to ever be able to switch your ships based on where they are in the hangar. So if I am operating seven systems away from my homebase and I've got twenty ships in my home hangar and I want to change out one of my ships, I have to go all the way back to my homebase, or have someone fly it out to me just to change out that ship, so a lot of times, I would think if you said \"oh, I'm going to operating in this system and do some trading here\", you may want to have a sort of almost \"forward operating base\" that you would have some of your ships in.I definitely think you'll be able to rent stuff and have more- and customize your hangar too, so in the persistent stuff that we're doing, that we are going to start to roll out, you are going to be able to customize your hangar in terms of place where your flair is. And eventually sort of expand it out and buy some extra space or some extra rooms and do all that, and the only caveat that would have is potentially a sort of rendering caveat. So at some point if you had seventy ships and you wanted to see them all on one long run, that's probably more than we could render at once, which is one of the reasons why we had limited hangars to a certain extent and then you could pick which ships you could have in the hangars, just essentially to not have the machine go to five frames-per-second.Now, we're optimizing things, so that will definitely be bigger but probably- there's not likely to be a case where you would have this sort-of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" hangar that goes as far as you can possibly see with as many ships as you can see. But I will promise that we will try to get as many ships in as we can, so ultimately I think it will move towards something that you would like, although I'm not sure it could have every single ship in it... but, it potentially will. Of course, the hangars won't be able to have very biggest ships in because they'll have to stay in orbit. But anyway, there you go.

Just mainly because we're going to bring in the Jump Points a little later on so we want to flesh out going down to a planet, landing on different areas and travelling between locations, planets in one system and trading and venturing into combat and then we'll open an additional system with 2 Jump Points and stuff like that.There will definitely, I mean the way i look at is you start with Alpha 2.0 and we'll move along and be building out that system and probably open another system or so with a Jump Point and then at some point we'll clean it all up and make it all work or be completely or be completely copacetic with the proper universe. We're already trying to make it like Crusader so as I said we decided just to take a few liberties to compress some of the play things you can do in this one system that will probably be more like, you know we showed going down landing at Levski which is on Delmar which is this large asteroid in the Nyx system and we're most likely going to put that in our Crusader SC Alpha for everyone to test out the seamless approach and landing and all the rest of the stuff and then when we have Jump Points we'll now move it over and it will be in Nyx.So that's kind of the process we're going to do with it, we're looking forward to getting that going looking forward to be able to have people buy and trade things and do more than what, right now it's just very freeform sandbox but you can see the potential already and getting things like running missions to deliver goods from point A to point B or to protect ships running goods from point A to point B are all very easy low hanging fruit. Building in things like the distress beacons that players can trigger when they need to be helped or saved which will generate a mission that can show up on a player's mission log.So we have a plan or what he have the overall things we want in the game and then we're also looking at some shorter term 'easy win' gameplay stuff that already kind of works with the system. Anyway that's the plan and you know we have a lot of people now, this past year we've had a fair amount of people too all working pretty hard on it, but I have to say everyone's incredibly pumped and excited just because the response for 2.0 and the response for the procedural tech that we showed; have the company on a high, so thank you all for liking all we showed you!", "published_at": "2015-12-21", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 73", "source": "https://youtu.be/MHLwAuM1J8c", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Gramm", "published_at_timestamp": 1450739049}, {"objectID": "17a3205577c824_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "There are no seats; the escape pod navigation is a standing station.

So one of the, that would be an idea that you'd name it, that that ship would be associated with the kills that it had and stuff like that, and I think it would be cool, and there may be, longer term, some small ways to incentivize players to keep their ships, rather than trade them in, so those are all things that I would be pretty keen on doing, stage two.The whole thing with the PU is you want to hold on, you want to continue living, you want to hold on to your ship. Kinda want people to play the game in a measured manner. In AC right now, you respawn when you die, so you go around, you fire your missiles, and then aaah, might as well respawn, get my ballistic ammo back, get my missiles back, well in the Persistent Universe you don't want to do that, because it's going to be a pain in the butt to wake up in the hospital room on some planet and go collect your new insurance-covered ship, but it's missing all the customizations you've done, but we've got a ship in the works, the Anvil Crucible, which is a repair ship, and that's all about getting out there and repairing the ships that've been damaged in space, so we definitely want to have gameplay around keeping your ship fixed up, patched, living, and having a history associated with it is one of the really good ways of doing it.", "published_at": "2015-07-27", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 61 (2015.07.27)", "source": "https://youtu.be/f8DX2VEeREY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Muad'dib", "published_at_timestamp": 1438036231}, {"objectID": "373682650", "question": "Hi Writers, Has CIG ever considered adding an Intergalactic Red Cross to the Star Citizen Lore and ultimately the PU (NPC-driven agency), which would generate humanitarian and disaster relief missions throughout the 'Verse including SAR, medical assistance, and evacuations?", "answer": "Adam Wieser: Yeah. There was a lore post which recently touched upon this briefly about a non-governmental agency going to provide aid for the Fora system. So yeah, it's definitely something that's in the back of our mind and it's something that excites us - to be able to have that be an element of the game too. So, not everything needs to be government-driven and not everything needs to be simple - hunt bad guy, bring bad guy back. It is a bigger universe. There are bigger problems and other questions out there. So, being able to do humanitarian aid, medical relief, stuff like that to the various systems is something that we would definitely like to make sure we incorporate going forward.Will Weissbaum: Yeah, that famine post was a great example and there is also the Charon III civil war we talked a little bit about like... ships trying to run the blockade there so... I think the idea of players being able to help people in a positive way is really kind of fun and refreshing and let's them feel more noble and it isn't, like you say, about killing the bad guy. And then, even on a smaller more personal level, we're going to have people that get their ships blown up and are sitting there in little escape pods that need to be picked up in those search and rescue operations - going around and helping your fellow player out and bringing them back in. That, I think, could make some really strong connections between players floating in this big dark scary universe, so that will be really nice.

One of the things we've been experimenting with internally is a method of setting your maximum speed - well, it's not really your maximum speed because you can exceed it but your normal combat speed - dynamically, based on a lot of different variables. And, part of that is the acceleration of your ship does play a part into what speed you can reach. So, the goal is to get something that's really interesting and dynamic and it's not just: Oh, well you have a Hornet so your top speed is always 200. Not just using an arbitrary method of coming up with a new top speed... really having that top speed figured out by not just your main engines but the ability of the other thrusters on your ship to contribute to your handling.MS: Yeah, the total package of how your ship moves really should be determining it.PM: Right, exactly.", "published_at": "2015-05-11", "published_at_timestamp": 1431381621, "question": "In space, will ships have the same optimal speed, but with a different acceleration, or simply different speed?", "source": "https://youtu.be/4RzDfTpTWtA", "title": "10 for the Designers: Episode 03 (2015.05.11)", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Banos", "time": "8m40s"}, {"objectID": "373676170", "question": "Will we be able to store mined ore from the Orion in our hangar or will we have to purchase a storage area?", "answer": "Well, I think everyone's hangars will be able to store whatever goods you have, assuming you've got the room &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; there's a certain amount. Now, the Orion itself mines a vast amount of bulk ore, so there's probably more ore that you would have on the Orion than you could actually store in most of your hangars. You know, generally in the sense of ore you would traditionally be mining it and then selling it to someone... but you could store it in your hangar, or you could store it elsewhere if you wanted to. I mean, it's just another unit. We basically physicalize all cargo or items, so whether it's a really big thing like a big huge container of ore or a small thing like a small gun, they're all treated the same in the system so you can put them in your hangar or if you can fit them in your hold, you can put them in your hold... and so on.", "published_at": "2015-03-23", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 57 (2015.03.23)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Aoooemaw2lY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Knightwolf", "published_at_timestamp": 1427148202}, {"objectID": "373683460", "question": "My question is about how shields currently work in AC, and in particular on the Hornet. Right now, if you fire your weapons, or even maneuver very much, it drains your shields. Is that intended operation? If so, do you anticipate modifying this design so that shield levels can be maintained during routine ship ops?", "answer": "A couple of answers to this question. First off, the shields, to maintain their shield level need a certain amount of energy. So if a ship is unbalance, i.e. you have too many items pulling too energy, like your thrusters, your shields, general standard operation stuff, then your shields will not be able to hold their top level. Right now we have a problem on our ships in Arena Commander because we haven't really done a very good job of balancing the items on the first three ships you have. So there's some out of skew like the 300i with way too much power coming from its power plant, there's some issues with the Hornet because there's not enough power... so there's gonna be a balancing pass that goes into the 12.5 patch, and then longer-term more balancing that goes into 13. But the way the shields are meant to work is that they need to maintain their level, but there will be some level of capacitor in the shields so it doesn't mean as soon as there's a spike in energy use it doesn't mean the shields necessarily go down. It's just that if you're overall energy output is lower than what you need to maintain the shields then over time the shields will drop down to whatever the equilibrium level is, based on the energy output. So this is actually one of the aspects that we're still tweaking and turning, but long term what will actually make for really interesting game play is how you set up your ship. So you know you have to balance your energy, like \"I know what my power plant is and what weapons I've got,\" so you make sure that your entire set up isn't going to be compromising your ship. The example would be, \"okay, well I've got too many things pulling too much power so I can't maintain my shields.\" Well at that point you may not need the shield generator that can have, you know, 200-level shields vs 100-level shields.So I guess the answer is, yes, it's kind of intended. There is going to be some level of capacitor on the shields so it doesn't instantly drop down or up, it will just over time drop down to equilibrium, so when you have a power spike it won't be fluctuating your shields as much. But if you aren't supplying enough energy over time to keep the shield up at its level then it will not be able to hold that level.One of the longer-term things is energy balancing on your ship. We're working on the HUD interface. It won't be in 12.5 but probably in 13 there's gonna be a much cleaner way of accessing an interface and all that stuff, so you control it and move between different profiles. But you know I kinda like in longer term combat, especially when we're gonna roll out some of the later stuff where you actually have to work as teams together, you're going to see a lot more smart use of weapons - when they're off, when they're on, when we're using them, you know, putting all our power into our shields, or putting our power into the thrusters... and that's kind of the idea of the combat system design of the ships. It's still very early days, that's why we're still balancing and we've still got some things that are broken in the system that don't let you get to appreciate that as much, but once everybody can play multiplayer, and also multiplayer in something that isn't like a free-for-all death match, because that really doesn't give you an opportunity to show off combat, because basically what happens is everyone spawns and someone is shooting at someone else and they're not looking at you and you shoot them in the back - it's madness basically. When you're playing team vs. team it's a lot different and some of the other game modes we're gonna have will be different, and then allowing people to alter and change their settings... \"ok, this is my one power configuration in this battle mode, and I'll have this other power profile when I'm doing this,\" or \"I'm running away from someone so I'm going to put all my power to my back shields.\" So we're going to allow you to have all that. There's already the infrastructure there in the systems. The interface is broken in some ways to let you do that, but that's what we're working on, and when we get all that balanced and you're doing all that, I actually think there's going to be a lot of interest and depth to combat. Especially when you don't have people spawn on top of each other, so you know, there'll definitely be cases where you can go sort of silent or dark and maybe surprise someone or hide against someone, or sneak up on someone. So there's a lot of possibilities.I know that answered a lot more than the question about the shields, but it sort of gives the idea of why all of these things are interconnected.", "published_at": "2014-07-07", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 28.

And that's actually part of the post launch content plan in terms of, we would actually have people whose job would be to watch the game and see what events were happening, make sure that we capture in-game footage of some of the events, and make news reports from around the world.So if two big organizations get into a battle over an asteroid base, that potentially could make front line news. And that's part of the idea of trying to put in news that we're constructing for the universe, you know, there's a famine in this sector, or whatever as well as player actions and blend it all into one, into our world, so it feels like the players are just as much part of the world as all our designed NPCs, and they feel like their actions have consequence.Personally, that's what I want in a game, I think that would greatly increase the immersion into this world. We're planning on that, and it will be really great I think when it happens.So I'm excited by that, and then the possibility of player run broadcasts, I wasn't thinking about this, but I think it's actually a really good idea, and it's probably pretty easy for us to provide channels, just like you can on internet radio. We probably could have our channels, just like you can in GTA, you can listen to different channels as you wander around, and then maybe we have some player channels that people can have their own streams on, and then you can tell people, and you could tune into it.That could be pretty cool.
