A popular aquarium fish, banded fessles in captivity have been bred to encourage docility and to accentuate their deep blue vertical stripes.</p><br/><h1>Description</h1><br/><p>Banded fessles are identifiable by their ovular heads, protruding mouths, and deep blue and white stripes. These stripes help them camouflage themselves among the seaweed and coral of their natural environment. They have squat, triangular dorsal fins, lowslung pectoral fins, and broad, strong tails. Their mouths are lined with two rows of small, sharp teeth which they use for grasping and consuming prey. Over a ten-year life cycle, a banded fessle can grow to between 40 and 50 cm long.</p><br/><h1>Behavior and Ecology</h1><br/><p>Banded fessles are ambush hunters, preying mainly on smaller fish, macroinvertebrates, and zooplankton. They play an important role in their ecosystem, keeping worms and other creatures from over-grazing on vegetation and disrupting delicate coral reefs. When hunting, a banded fessle floats motionless among local environmental features until a prey animal passes about 5 cm from its hiding spot. It then strikes before its prey is aware of its presence. At around three years of age, a banded fessle will begin to seek out a mate. Banded fessles form lifelong pairs. Each fish will protect the other from threats, assist in hunting, share larger prey, and fend off potential suitors. A banded fessle that has lost its mate sometimes refuses to seek another.</p><br/><p>When they are ready to spawn, the pair seek out an appropriate spawning medium, usually a strong seaweed frond or sheltered coral surface. The female then lays a line of eggs and the male fertilizes them. They repeat this process until they have laid up to a thousand eggs. The parents guard their offspring until they learn to hunt on their own. About 1 percent survive to adulthood.</p><br/><p>In general, banded fessles seldom venture more than 12 meters deep, although they have been recorded at depths of 15 meters when pursuing prey.</p><br/><h1>Aquarium Fish</h1><br/><p>Prized for their pairing behavior and their vibrant, contrasting colors, banded fessles are one of the more popular aquarium fish in the UEE. They number among the marine life that can be raised in tanks alongside fish indigenous to Earth (Sol III). Ideally, they should be kept in warm saltwater, about 24 to 25 degrees Celsius. Because they can grow to be up to 50 cm long, they should only be kept in very large tanks (750 liters or more per fish).</p><br/><p>The banded fessle is not territorial, but as a carnivore, it can pose a danger to other fish in a shared tank.

We know that the entity graph will collect the seeded information and feed it back into a new replication layer, but will we return to the main menu if the Replication layer dies compared to if a server node dies, or will we have some sort of loading screen that automatically match-makes us into a new layer?", "answer": "To answer this properly, I first need to give some more detail on what our final architecture will look like. Ultimately, the Replication Layer won't be a single server node. Instead, it will consist of multiple instances of a suite of microservices with names like Replicant, Atlas, and Scribe. One advantage of this is that the Replication layer itself will be able to scale. Another advantage, more relevant to this question, is that although a single node/instance in the Replication layer may fail, it's very unlikely the whole Replication layer will fail at once. From a client's point of view, the Replicant nodes are the most important as it is those that will handle networked entity steaming and state replication between clients and the game. The Replicant is designed to not run any game logic and, in fact, it will run very little code at all; no animation, no physics, just network code. Being built from such a small codebase should mean fewer bugs overall. So, after some inevitable teething troubles, we're expecting Replicants to be pretty stable. It's also important to know that, at any one time, a single client may be served by multiple Replicants (but those Replicants will also be serving other clients at the same time). The final piece of the puzzle is the Gateway layer: Clients won't connect directly to Replicants but instead to a gateway node in the Gateway layer. The Gateway service is just there to direct packets between clients and the various Replicants they are talking to. The Gateway service will use an even smaller codebase than the Replicant so should be even less likely to crash.<br/><br/><b>So what will a client experience if one of the Replicants serving it suddenly crashes?</b><br/><br/>The client will remain connected to the shard but part or all of their simulation will temporarily freeze. The Replication layer will spin up a new replicant node to replace the one that crashed and will recover the lost entity state from persistence via EntityGraph. The client gateways and DGS nodes that were connected to the old replicant will re-establish connection with the new one. Once everything is reconnected, the game will unfreeze for the affected clients. At this point the client may experience some snapping/teleporting of entities. We're hoping the whole process will take less than a minute.<br/><br/><b>What will a client experience if the gateway serving it suddenly crashes?</b><br/><br/>The Gateway service doesn't hold any game state and will have its own form of crash recovery. Since it's a much simpler service than a replicant, the recovery time should be much quicker, more in the region of seconds. While the recovery is in progress, the client will experience a temporary freeze followed by some snapping/teleporting.<br/><br/><b>What about the Hybrid service?</b><br/><br/>During their CitizenCon presentation on Persistent Streaming and Server Meshing, Paul and Benoit talked about the Replication layer in terms of the Hybrid service. The Hybrid service is, as its name suggests, a hybrid of the Replicant, Atlas, Scribe, and Gateway services I mentioned above (but not EntityGraph), as well as a handful of other services not discussed yet. We have chosen to develop this first before splitting it into its component services as it reduces the number of moving parts we're trying to deal with all at once. It also allows us to focus on proving out all the big concepts rather than the boilerplate of having all those individual services communicate correctly. In this initial implementation, the Replication layer will be a single Hybrid server node. If this Hybrid node crashes, then the situation will be similar to what clients experience now when a dedicated game server crashes. All clients will get kicked back to the frontend menu with the infamous 30k error. Once the replacement Hybrid has started, clients will be able to rejoin the shard and continue where they left off. Hopefully, we'll be able to implement it such that the clients receive an on-screen notification that the shard is available again and a single keypress will match them back to the shard (similar to how it works for client crash recovery).", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/18397-Server-Meshing-And-Persistent-Streaming-Q-A", "published_at": "2021-11-10", "published_at_timestamp": 1636502400, "title": "Server Meshing and Persistent Streaming Q&A", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "f684d7718e8b_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Will reputation system allow player to unlock exclusive and not exclusive ship, ship weapon, ship component, FPS weapon, armor, suits, skins etc for some factions and missions givers?", "answer": "What we have been talking a lot about lately is exactly \"what rewards will be associated with each org/reputation track\" and \"at which ranks we see these types of things being rewarded.\" One of the things we've discussed is things like unlocking an org's paint/tint colors for use on particular item types at some of the higher ranks.

This might result in a situation where some Players know where to go to acquire those resources, and other Players don't have a clue. Luke posits that there might therefore be easier missions that direct you to a location instead. There are further complications too, such as how it's determined whether the Player has the right type of resource in their inventory, whether that resource can be deposited, how it is deposited, and so on. The same goes for Trading, which would also require a console/Terminal somewhere. One of the things holding them back is that the Trading consoles were built before the new UI Building Blocks tech that has been developed (or is being developed, I'm under the impression that it's not done yet but every now and then they talk as if it's done), so it's not something that Designers can get into and start changing - at least not yet, because there are plans to eventually remake these consoles in Building Blocks which will allow the Missions Team to take some pressure off of the UI Team. Something that Elliot does is to build an ugly wireframe UI model that's functional and shows how the Missions Team wants the UI to function, and generally how they want it to be laid out. The UI Team would then go in and make it look pretty. Luke adds that hopefully in the future there will be less \"sticking points\" which are caused by the UI Team having too many tasks to do on the schedule, and with the new UI Building Blocks the Mission Team are now free to kind of do it themselves. That said, the UI Team are providing styles within which any box (or whatever) that is created will look like that style. Jared reiterates that we'll get to see what this new UI Building Blocks tech is in the ISC segment coming in 2 to 3 weeks, but also adds that it's not hyperbole to say that it will revolutionise the way that the Designers get to implement their missions, their ship UIs, their kiosk UIs - everything. This will take a lot of strain off of the UI Team, and allow Designers at all levels to push forward with a lot of features that we've all been waiting for.", "time": "51m8s", "published_at_timestamp": 1564772763}, {"objectID": "ddaa304a0c056_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The skins are unique to Warbond SKUs.

What progress have they made with this?", "answer": "They used Flash and are still using it now, but they're trying to transition away from it by baking their assets into a much more data-driven system. Previously in Flash, you set things up in a static way where you can't see how it looks in-game until you export it and reload the editor. With the data-driven system, the interface with the game code is much more simplified, and they have a standard API so that a task such as creating UI for an ammo counter is really simple and updates live. This means that they can be in-game and have an editor open and work on the UI at the same time, to see what it looks like as they work on it. It's still using Scaleform as a renderer, meaning that they've cut out the process of authoring the UI in Flash, but they're still using Scaleform to draw the vectors but only for that rendering task, and the rest of the work is done by their own code instead. At some point though, they'll build their own render to replace Scaleform. Jared jokingly asks Zane how long he's been waiting to kill Flash, who says he's been waiting since he started working at the company, 6+ years ago (for those who many not know, Zane was an early hire straight out of college and originally worked in the Austin office, which back then was just a house, and this was also during the days of Wingman's Hangar). Simon adds to the discussion by explaining that Flash was originally designed as an animation system for web stuff, so it can be used for things like UI but it's hard to do iterative work with it where things change based upon feedback, which is because it's time extensive. Conversely, with the building blocks stuff it's quick and simple and they have a lot of control. Zane goes on to say that that's also true because it's a fully data-driven system, so the UI is programmatically drawn and driven from data so they don't worry about artists stepping on each others toes, because the changes the artists make can be merged together.", "published_at": "2019-07-19", "title": "Star Citizen Live: All Things UI", "source": "https://youtu.be/6lSmdJ5UydE", "transcript": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/cg2gwf/a_summary_of_star_citizen_live_all_things_ui/", "type": "youtube", "time": "22m18s", "published_at_timestamp": 1563572591}, {"objectID": "189b899348cd73_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Yes.

So there is going to be physically loading and unloading and they\u2019ll also be, whether you want to call it automated or AI unloading/loading in sort of bigger space ports or bigger landing areas because that\u2019s generally what would happen in those cases, but there\u2019s definitely  going to be gameplay that would involve you say flying out supplies to a remote outpost and there is no people there to help load or unload and you have to unload it. Or you come across some stuff you want to get that\u2019s floating in space, you have to load that in manually and do all the rest. So there\u2019s going to be both loading and unloading physically which we already have shown a small amount of like you looked at the Gamescom demo that we did of going to the moon after visiting Levski and Delmar and there were some crates, little containers and we picked it up and were taking it to the Freelancer we were flying at the time. That is an example of the more granular physical loading and unloading.<br /><br />There will be equipment that will allow you to move bigger containers around. So we have some standard size, larger cargo containers and that will have sort of a grav lev jack stuff and potentially there will be other, whether we create some vehicles or things like the Argo to move smaller stuff around and then load it up onto bigger stuff.<br /><br />So I think we\u2019re going to have both, I don\u2019t know if you want to elaborate on it because I know you already talked a bit about it.<br /><br />TZ: Yeah that\u2019s basically it. To me personally, lik the most interesting stuff is actually when you\u2019re dealing with smaller quantities that you actually have to hand load because it just makes for more interesting mission scenarios when you don\u2019t want to just deliver it to the shop. Now I actually have to basically travel through space with this material that I procured, land and then I have to do that last leg and now i\u2019m on foot and it\u2019s just a completely different type of experience, different types of challenges we can throw at a player.<br /><br />CR: What I would say that like, smuggling would be a case that you\u2019re not going to have a\u2026<br /><br />TZ: A supertanker full of fuel becomes hard to justify smuggling.<br /><br />CR: Yeah, well\u2026 and there\u2019s going to be all sizes of you know, there can be items that you can hold in your hand that you would potentially smuggle or carry it like diamonds or something, could be gems could be an example of that to a really massive containers that are just full of ore or liquids or whatever. So there\u2019s all kinds of it so there is, besides big bulk cargo because you have bulk cargo stuff and more bespoke like if I was collecting I don\u2019t know, sort of rare space truffles. So space truffles don\u2019t come in massive ton container things, they would be small containers, but they would be worth a lot of money so that would be something you would probably take personally around and of course you have smaller things like I was mentioning gems or perhaps contraband or you\u2019re smuggling drugs or things that you shouldn\u2019t smuggle and those particular ones you would have to put away in a hidden compartment, that was shielded, hope you don\u2019t get scanned or boarded by the Advocacy and then when you get on the planet you\u2019re going to have to Han Solo style sneak it off your ship.<br /><br />That\u2019s the beauty of having it all based on essentially a kind of character level, first person level because it\u2019s not just about the ship, it\u2019s about also there\u2019s extra mechanics once you\u2019ve landed and how do I get past the guards with this stuff and so I think that\u2019s going to add a whole bunch of like, fun gameplay for people.<br /><br />TZ: Yeah to me, I\u2019ve said before I tend to get bored fairly easily if I\u2019m not constantly presented with different types of challenges and so I like the ability to take the high level concept of cargo transport and basically extend it as such that it doesn\u2019t just involve ships, but you\u2019ve actually got, whether you\u2019re getting the stuff back to your ship and then do the space travel etc, or if you\u2019ve landed with your ship and you need to actually get it to the guy in the back alley without security seeing you or whatever the case may be or you\u2019re carrying something really valuable and now since you\u2019re actually holding it, you\u2019re at a disadvantage because it takes you a couple seconds longer to actually drop that, pull your weapon so you\u2019re actually more vulnerable when you\u2019re running through the CD tunnels of Levski or something like that. So all of a sudden you can see players starting to do this mental calculus and thinking, \u201cWell am I going to go on my own? Do I basically try to recruit a few friends, do I hire an NPC body guard as I\u2019m doing this?\u201d It\u2019s all that variety that to me, really makes it interesting.<br /><br />CR: Yeah, well..<br /><br />TZ: Every player is going to go about it in a little bit different fashion.<br /><br />CR: Yeah, I mean.. Because obviously I read what people write out on our forums and elsewhere, but there\u2019s a lot, like people go, \u201cI want to know more about game mechanics\u201d, but in reality  there\u2019s a huge amount of, essentially what people would normally consider game mechanics or gameplay that comes out us building these core systems and we\u2019ve really been pushing and it\u2019s been taking longer than obviously we were thinking it was going to take and partly it\u2019s because we\u2019re building it to work at a scale and across a huge universe and with millions of players, but our belief is that if we build these systems that are super flexible. So like we talked about item 2.0 and I think in the last studio update from L.A. we showed a little prototype of the interaction and if you take a look at the interaction, that\u2019s not an interaction system that you see in any FPS game. It\u2019s like you can pick things up and use them and plug them into something else and put a battery into something to turn it on or open up compartments and take. So you have this ability to manipulate items and use them and they have the ability to do what you would normally expect like a battery provides power and if this radio needed power, then you put it in and now suddenly the radio can work and maybe that will help you achieve something else.<br /><br />So we\u2019re basically building this system and a good example of it is like when we\u2019re talking about the smuggling because all the stuff we\u2019re talking about in general falls out of the system of being able to physically own and manipulate, put stuff in areas and all the rest of the stuff so you know all we really have to do on top of that is just determine that these items are illegal and the AI logic for the law enforcement, the advocacy, whoever is that if they catch you with it, you\u2019re in trouble, but in general the manipulation, the hiding of it and all the rest, that all falls out of the scanning stuff that we\u2019ve been working on, the item manipulation stuff that we\u2019ve been working on.<br /><br /><br />So a lot of our professions we\u2019ve talked at the base level of what we want to have for 3.0 kind of fall out of these core mechanics that we worked really, really hard on, but I think once they\u2019re done it\u2019s just going to provide a platform quite a ways beyond what you can currently do in 2.6.1. And that\u2019s when I get excited.<br /><br />TZ: Yeah we\u2019ve talked about this a number of times before to where basically you build the system and  you get it setup properly, then it requires very little tweaking to affect a lot of gameplay, a lot of interesting gameplay potential and this is basically the route we\u2019ve gone since the very beginning. We didn\u2019t want to go the route of having to custom code each one of these things and then yes the addition of new content becomes an enormously difficult task, and then you see this in a lot of other games to where the amount of content, the amount of new content that you can release always lags behind what the players can actually experience. They usually go out, they experience the new content and then they run in circles for the next 12 months until the next big update happens and in this case we wanted to eventually get to the point where we can put in place what I\u2019d call a functional world and then basically we just give you entry points into that and everything else more or less falls out of that.<br /><br />CR: We\u2019re getting close.

They identify those, if it\u2019s not in Jira they put it in, then they find resources for the bugs. Lots of Jake\u2019s job is making sure the blockers get a high focus from the resources assigned to them. At the end of each day there\u2019s a hand off, saying these are the remaining blockers, these are what\u2019re being handed off, etc\u2026 Everything gets handed around between the studios, so there\u2019s no real lapse in communication, no situations where a bug will sit for days without getting looked at.

Can you settle a big debate: how does this square with the perma-death concepts envisioned in 'Death of a Spaceman'?", "answer": "On the Drake side, one of the ideas is Drake ships are ... we envision them a little like the Russian military hardware where it's like very rugged, it's functional, but doesn't have a lot of extra bells and whistles, say like the US military equipment would do. And so one of the things that generally you wouldn't necessarily get on a Drake ship would be all the extra stuff like the ejection seat, especially in something like the Cutlass but even more recently the Buccaneer. And that enables them to have ... to deliver value elsewhere like in ... better value for your money in terms of the weapons you get for the price and all the rest of the stuff.In terms of \"Death of a Spaceman\" I mean the thing to remember about \"Death of a Spaceman\" is that even though say your ... you get blown up ... like if your ship ... if you're in the ship and it gets blown up that doesn't mean that you're dead instantly because the way we look at the game is it is lives that you have. So you ... essentially if you eject, potentially you'll get in an escape pod, you can get out there and you ... potentially you can save your life. But any one of your characters before you move on to your next ... you have to move ... you put your old character away and move on to your new one which, whether it would be a designated next-of-kin or a whole new character you decide you want to move to, in that particular case you'll have quite a few opportunities ... you'll have more than one case where you \"die\" so to speak in space and then you'll wake up in the med bay and they've patched you up and then you'll only be able to do that so many times before obviously your body will give out. And that's kind of the idea of \"Death of a Spaceman\". It's like taking a bit of the \"life\" mechanic from the gold old days of early game design and that's the number of times you can be brought back by modern medical technology and then after that you have to ... your old character is passed away and you move onto a new character.So obviously it is a little bit more risky in a Drake ship than say a ship that has something like an ejection seat. Although you are able to get out of ... whether it's the Cutlass or whether it's even a Buccaneer, you should be able to get out just like you can get out and EVA out of certain ships like the Hornet and stuff. It's just a matter of you may not be able to get out quite a quickly so you'll just have to be aware of that but I think the people that fly Drake ships are so good they don't need to to always have to eject. Back in World War I they didn't give some of the airmen parachutes because they should be so good they didn't need to actually parachute out. I think that would probably be how we would think ... a Drake pilot would think of themselves as.So there you are. I hope that kind of answered the question. But we do definitely want to have this sense of different design criteria between our different ships. And so some ones are got more frills and more features but then they cost more. Some have less and so in some ways could be considered better value for money, easier to replace or easier to fix and that would definitely be Drake.", "published_at": "2016-06-20", "title": "Star Citizen: 10 for the Chairman - Episode 85", "source": "https://youtu.be/9IubH4hHIFw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Deathstroke", "published_at_timestamp": 1466460877}, {"objectID": "373674290", "question": "I've seen a few posts complaining about strafe fighting.

That's correct?KT: Correct. The Vanduul components were implemented as Vanduul components. The Xi'an components will not, they'll actually be ... as we're doing a component refactor, the Xi'an components will be actual manufacture components. So we'll have \"human\" components that are on the ships so that you can upgrade them, exchange them them out, etc. In the future I think we will work with the writers and then come up with the alien manufacturers, each with their own components and capabilities. So that we can do things like have Xi'an specific components or whatnot. For now we are currently going with the human componentsDV: One of the things, if you guys actually watched the 10 for the Developers with Sean Tracy and Steve Bender, one of the things they talked about was human-to-alien analog components. For example if a Vanduul is how X feet taller than a human you don't want a human wearing a Vanduul t-shirt because it's going to be a lot bigger. So we also have to take that into consideration as far as when we create these alien manufacturers. We can't just take an alien t-shirt and throw it on a human and say \"hey we're done\". We have to take into consideration if the humans' size are; that their dimensions are; whether it is compatible with human ergonomics at all. So rather than just creating a bunch of alien manufacturers we want to make sure it is something that is realistic; that fits into the story; and actually fits into the game mechanically as well.KT: Right and that's a conversation for the Khartu-Al: the control scheme are these two spherical control components that humans will put their hands on.

They had their own custom UI that had an alien flavour to it.DV: Right.KT: The same thing would be true for the Xi'an type of ships.DV: That's why Zane, our UI guy, he put static across the UI as if trying to show that we are trying to translate alien technology into human use.

I think part of it was, particularly with the PTU that's coming out, that we're working on, large world, it was supposed to be mostly a test bed so we wanted to be able to try stuff and get it in the game and figure out what would become the PU would work ultimately. I think basically if we started adding fiction to it then we would have to come up with fiction as to why things changed and it just felt like it would probably be easier to just free ourselves from that and be able to iterate rapidly as new systems come online we can start incorporating them and stuff like that.Matt Sherman: Even from the design side, as great as those things would be, not having that overhead constraint really lets us make sure that the design and the gameplay can come through. But once we get the whole thing up and running and we've got the real PU all built out do you think think that's something we can probably explore then/later?DH: I feel like it probably will just because Chris likes packaging stuff in the fiction because it gives you a context that let's you know the parameters of what you're playing with.

It's something we start to see a little bit in 2.0 coming up is having this content that you'll be able to find and read as well as sit back kind of have random material. It takes a fair chunk of effort to create these assets, I was always really impressed playing in Bethesda games where they have full books you can read, it was something I thought was really neat so we'll have to see how much of something like that, we can do.One of the neat things we have is that so many of you out there are already generating a ton of really cool content so maybe it's the kind of thing we can look into doing a call for magazine articles for this one kind of magazine and take backer submissions for that to feature in game would be really fun but we'd have to figure all that out.Adam Wieser: Yeah it's definitely every day it's great to come in and see the message boards and see some of the role playing you guys are doing because it's really inspiring and it's really great to see your own personal spin on the world that's being built.

If you take a look at the Constellation there's three people in the front seats of the Constellation. There's not a particular design choice, I think it comes out of what we think that works for the ship itself so a lot of the functionality is driven by the needs so something like the Vanguard or the Retaliator, sort of military ships, in those sort of cases it feels like you've got the pilot and maybe you've got the gunner and they're obviously not necessarily going to be in the same place. Where as the Constellation is sort of more of a communal, team ship and is more general purpose so you can see the three main crew members sitting in those front three seats.

What are you going to do to prevent anything similar and what can be the reason for that phenomenon?", "answer": "Lisa Ohanian: So the answer to the first part of that question, what are we doing to prevent this, everything that we can. The reason you'll see this sometimes is because you'll see games, usually ones with bigger publishers, that have committed to retail stores, committed to marketing dates, a year, a year and a half in advance, that means those games have to come out those days, no matter how much polish they get, or maybe don't get to do. You'll often see those games release patches or something later on to help bring things up to where they were aiming to be. On the flip side, you'll see people push their dates back when they can, because they're seeing the trajectory, and the features they might have added or things that didn't turn out the way they might have wanted, and in order to keep quality high you have to push things back a little bit, or else you're one of those half-finished products that you guys are asking us questions about.So it's always kind of a give and take.Darian Vorlick: On top of that, if anybody's ever preordered a game before, you'll see, lets say Amazon, you'll see a release date a year ahead of time, before any kind of release date is actually published, and a lot of times those dates are actually set by the retailer in anticipation of what the game's release date is going to be. Now, interesting about what we do at Cloud Imperium, because we don't have a parent company, we're not beholden to marketing deadlines or publishing deadlines. We pretty much set those internally. And those dates are set collectively by the entire company, whether it's Chris Roberts or  the Marketing team, the Development team, the Production team, we all kind of have a say on when those dates are.So, with the case for Gamescom, it was very obvious that our deadline was Gamescom. We had to have that finished for Gamescom, because we couldn't push Gamescom back, so you'll see a lot of scrambling to get that done. So it depends on what the deadline is, what is it for, and how badly do we need to meet it. If it's a deadline that can be moved and we feel that the quality is going to suffer if we release it right now, then clearly it's better to push that deadline back and make sure we reach those quality benchmarks.LO: A lot of games will also have sort of an internal range, and they have the luxury of not mentioning their game or announcing it until they've decided, okay, yeah, we can definitely make this date, which is something we don't really have the luxury of, since we started engaging our backers so early.DV: Yeah, our game is very transparent.LO: It's good but it's also challenging.DV: You can see every little thing that we...LO: Every second.", "published_at": "2015-08-17", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 11", "source": "https://youtu.be/9y1X4tLFdU0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "MF140884", "time": "0m41s", "published_at_timestamp": 1439849467}, {"objectID": "373682020", "question": "What do you think about presenting the project status pagehttps://robertsspaceindustries.com/project-statusin a better way and show some love so that every backer also some that were away for 6 months or longer can see what is the current game status and what stuff is currently worked on for the next patch in 2 minutes?", "answer": "Darian Vorlick: Whew.Eric Kieron Davis: He was referring to a page that someone was using more like a scrum board.  So, this is a really great question.  This is something we struggle with all the time &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; we have a lot going on all the time and internally we have a lot to track, we have a lot to manage, we have a lot to keep on top of and to keep our developers and ourselves focused.  To keep focused on getting out a product.  So, we have our amazing community team down here that works really closely with us that just tries to pump as much information out as possible.  So, going from the very high level &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; one word, this is the status of that &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; into a breakdown for each single one of those I think is a great idea and I think it would be something we'd love to do.  I don't know if it's feasible in the short term but I definitely think it's something we'd love to do.  Some way we can provide you guys a lot of information quickly so that if you do go away and are like, \"I'll be back when you have more game done.\" and you come back and can see where we're at.  I think it's a great idea.  We've definitely looked at stuff like that, I just don't know if we're at that place yet.DV: I don't know how well it would help transparency either.  I guess because so many features get pushed up and pushed back on a regular basis just even within the Arena Commander team &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Calix could be working on one thing one moment and then because we have a deadline coming up he may have to shift focus on to something completely different.  And unless you've got one of the Cloud Imperium guys or ladies constantly updating, \"He's shifting focus because of this.\"  Without that kind of context, it will look like we just stopped developing it and we don't want you guys to get the wrong impression that we've stopped working on something when that developer is simply just shifting focus on to something else for the moment.EKD: Absolutely.DV: So, while we'd like to be able to give you those kinds of updates on a regular basis, we'd have to kind of unify on how we wanted to deliver that and how we would provide context on what's going on.  I think that's a very challenging thing, especially with how open our development already is in the first place.EKD: Totally, and going back to what Darian said about breaking new ground, right, we're doing new things.  Some things that a lot of us didn't do at previous organizations and things we're even learning how to do with you guys.  So, I think we're constantly learning along the road of... how can we be transparent and provide information but how can we get things done at the same time because that's two full-time jobs.  Two full-time things we need to do.  So, we're always looking for ways to do that.

While we have ways to make things not recognizable at distances we do a lot of blending between multiple textures so at a distance you can't really tell, It's like similar approaches to what games have been using for terran for years. The big challenge is working on the capital ships, the further you get away the harder it is to keep the scale and detail looking correct.Omar Aweidah: A lot of it isn't even technical, it's just design, at this distance you know starcitizen looks like a repeating tile so when you start reaching that range you probably want to break up the ship in some sort of design so it changes material so something distracts it and being clever because you know your limitations. You know it is going to eventually look like it is tiled, there is just no way around it if you are tiling entire ships.FS: Exactly it is all about being clever, and you LOD to so geometry up close looks different from far away.OA: What does LOD stand for?FS: Level of Detail.OA: Okay.FS: You thought I was going to say Distance.OA: No, I thought it was level of display.FS: Did you really think it was level of display?OA: No-one ever told me.

So Arena Commander currency is something that a lot of the community has requested since the inception of Arena Commander. The ability to have credits earned that you can use to try out other pieces of equipment that you may not own. So this is something that is definitely on our roadmap for the beginning of next year. So it's coming to a patch near you, pre-Arena Commander 2.0, and it will basically allow you to earn \"Arena Commander bucks\", \"moon buck\", a new form of currency that can be used for the purchase redemption, otherwise obtaining of items for Arena Commander. So they will not carry over to the Persistent Universe, but within Arena Commander you will be able to use items that you do not own if you've earned them using Arena Commander currency. The ship component upgrade system, I'm not actually entirely sure what you're specifically referring to, but the components themselves you will be able to purchased with Arena Commander currency just the same as the ships. So if that's what you meant, there's your answer.Darian Vorlick: So with the Arena Commander currency you're saying... \"I like the way that laser gun looked on my opponents ship, and it really tore me up\" ... I can just rent one? And, you know, pay for it and pay a monthly fee, or some kind of ongoing fee to keep it on my ship?TD: The exact design of, like is it a recurring fee, or is it a one-time fee, or how that's gonna work hasn't actually been fleshed out yet.

Will I be able to build a relationship with an alien race to the point that the UEE might name me an Ambassador?", "answer": "I think that's a great suggestion, probably too specific for us this early on really, but definitely on the exploration side there are gameplay elements that will tie into academia, so if you think about it, Harrison Ford in Raiders of the Lost Ark was an academic that explored in the field, so that's kind of covered by a fiction series we've had on our site. So there's the level of exploration that might be commissioned by a university or something, though I don't know if you'd be able to write up Theses on the subjects, laughs, though I'm pretty sure on a player fan fiction side there'll be a bunch of that. On the diplomatic/ambassador side we currently don't have plans for that, but I will say that we have more specific roles planned for down the track, like in system-reporters where players can go around and record/report on stuff that might go on newscasts. We're creating tools for that, and perhaps letting players go on the advocacy and stuff like that so we ARE going in the way of allowing people to play most of the roles out there, I don't know if it'll get as high as a diplomat, but down the road who knows, I mean part of the magic here is is that we wan't to accommodate those players that don't necessarily want to be the war hero, or the dastardly pirate or whatever, perhaps they just want to exist in this world.

Will the hospital ship be used as a mobile respawn point?", "answer": "So, yes - that is the intent. So the intention with the hospital ship is to have the functionality that you would get in a hospital, down on a planet-side (which is essentially where you would respawn, or you would go to fix up critical injuries) be able to be mobile, and be able to be maybe in a system that there wouldn't normally be a planet that has that. The ambulance is sort of the idea which is what we've got with the rescue on the Cutlass Red. The idea is that that's a place where you could go and pick someone up that's badly injured in space in a way that maybe they would \"lose a life\" per the \"Death of a Spaceman\" mechanic, but if you get them in the ambulance, get them on the bed, fix them up, patch them up, you can sort of save that life. Because the idea is that every one of your characters only has so many lives before the body totally gives out and you've gotta move onto the next of kin, and you know, the designated successor. And so the Cutlass Red - the ambulance basically - and the hospital ships are both ways of enhancing or increasing your survivability, and making it that you won't lose a life.

If so, which ones and for how long did you play them? Which ones did you like? Which did you not? Which ones, if any, have influenced your decisions when it comes to the design of the Persistent Universe?", "answer": "So I think that's an interesting question. I guess it depends on your definition of what a game with a persistent universe is. The simplest could be potentially Demon Souls, because people can write messages and they persist, but there's not really a lot of other stuff going on there. I would say, potentially you could classify an MMO like World of Warcraft, or Eve Online as particularly a persistent game. One of the goals that we have on Star Citizen is to have the actual universe persist, but also change and morph over time and also be reactive to the player actions - so the player actions are actually shaping the universe. I haven't particularly seen that... I know in Trian's \"Rift\" that was sort of the idea, and also in Guild Wars 2 that's the idea, but both those games have come out recently and unfortunately over the last 3 years I've pretty much had down working on Star Citizen, so I haven't really had the chance to get in and play any of those ones.So I guess my answer would be, I haven't really played any that have done what I would like a game to do in terms of persistence in a universe, and that's kinda why I'm making Star Citizen.

Which means that when you're in-system and someone beams a message, it gets beamed at the speed of light, and it gets beamed to a relay station, or a message station. This is in the structured universe where the UEE runs it and there's a lot of infrastructure. So one of these stations is right by a jump point so it gets all the information and then it will launch out a message drone or a messenger ship. It goes through the jump point to the other side, where there's probably another relay station, it's collected, then the data gets beamed across to another relay station and so-on and so-forth if it has to go multiple systems.Essentially the speed of communication is based around the speed of light and how long that message would take to travel in system, and then it's instantaneous in between system jumps, except for the regularity or the schedule of the message drones or the messenger ships that go through the jump points. So in a very populated core system, that's happening all the time, but in a backwater system, it won't be very frequent at all.In fact in some systems, there won't be any of that infrastructure. That's where inforunners and other people come in to account. Because they'll be taking missions to take information that's critical and as fast as they can. Especially if there's other people who want to stop that information getting there.So in terms of game time, it's kind of hard to quantify, but I think we would probably limit it within the limits that I gave there. How long it would take you to actually transfer to a jump point and what the regularity is.But obviously we recognize that people will be able to chat and talk to each other instantly, because if we don't provide it in the game, they're gonna be doing it outside the game anyway. So we're gonna provide it, but in terms of any goods or missions being accepted, missions being offered, all the in game stuff that we do control will all operate at the speed of communication in our universe.", "published_at": "2014-04-07", "title": "10 for the Chairman - Episode 15 .

When we get to a certain point, we can make a choice, of \"Do we do it right, the way it's going to be in the final game?\" or \"Do we hack something in right now just so we can give it to people?\" My preference generally in that case is \"Don't hack it, do it right.\" 'Cause if you hack it, you put it in, you do work that you're gonna have to throw away. We're really part of--the whole idea of the Dogfighting Module is to get it out there so we can test the back-end and see how many people we can have in one area, see how fun it is flying the ships around, see whether the weapons are balanced correctly. It's not really that useful if you're throwing it out there with the back-end which won't be your final back-end. So I think I'm leaning towards doing it the proper way, although that potentially has impact on when everyone gets their hands on it.
