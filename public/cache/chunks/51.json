Maybe not all ships would have them, so obviously RSI ships like an Aurora could quite easily dock with a Constellation but potentially it wouldn't necessarily be as easy to do perhaps an Aurora doesn't dock with a Freelancer: you have to get outside, EVA over and then go in through the airlock of the Freelancer.So generally we think in most cases the bigger ships with the airlocks would be able to do the airlock docking and the smaller ones may or may not be able to. But we've still got to work the mechanics and features out of that so it is hard for me to give a blanket statement other than say that I don't it is going to be consistent that everything can dock with everything else. So if ships have standardised docking rings then there is a good likelihood that those ships could dock together.", "published_at": "2016-02-01", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 76", "source": "https://youtu.be/GOyEcb5jJfE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Calec", "published_at_timestamp": 1454367842}, {"objectID": "373682910", "answer": "Eric Kieron Davis: Good question, No. So you guys saw some commercials early on, even saw back in the kickstarter campaign it was showing off some of our stuff. The goal of those was to bring to light exactly what we're working on and what we've got what we're doing, but we've kind of shifted the way we do that now right? We do these, we show you in the livestreams, we've got all kinds of ways to show you the content we're working on.The Retaliator as it came to make more sense to go into the multi-crew release that would be when we would show it off. So we don't necessarily need a commercial for that. That's a big part of production is we're' always evaluating what the needs of the business are, what the needs of what we're delivering are, what marketing is requesting from us. We're still developing a lot of the stuff so I know they're always working on, Sandi is working with their team and with development and they're always kind of going back and forth about what makes sense and what would help you guys see the content we're working on.So things change all the time and specifically like commercials which I was working on when I first got here. It was kind of getting the scope of what we really wanted to show and what resource we need for it because we want to keep it minimal, we want to show you the cool stuff with keeping minimal resources. So that one, it did not happen. But it's because we showed the Retaliator to you in another way.Forrest Stephan: And I think that the thing is also our commercials are pretty awesome right? I mean I love them and they take really talented people to make those commercials and a lot of the time we were able to use those commercials to also make the art required for like Squadron 42 and stuff like that so right now we're so heavily invested in Squadron 42 as far as our resources concerned and we're like nose deep, grinding on that thing that a lot of our talent, especially our Cinematic Team who are absolutely awesome, they are currently concentrating on cinematics for Squadron 42. It's also a resource thing, it's not like you hit a switch or just like here's some money, go make it happen, it actually requires certain talents of people.EKD: Totally, Totally, good question.

Or will plater interaction in the system dictate how the lore is written for it?", "answer": "Adam Wieser: When we are ready to release new systems to you guys, we will definitely have a firm idea of any lore that's behind that to certain degree: if there's any secret places; or if it was maybe formerly inhabited or not; or visited by a different species. We'll probably have, at least at the beginning, a good idea of that but I think where the system goes from there will depend a lot on who finds it and how they present it.Some people may want to keep the system for themselves; for their org; for their pirate group and use it as some kind of black market hub for certain things. Others may just turn around the information; give it to the UEE; sell it off; and then invite people in. So there's definitely going to be an element where you the players will be able to help determine it. If there are any important story points that we want to get across there that's probably something we would have figured out before you get to it.Will Weissbaum: Yeah, I mean until we have procedural generation of systems up and running it's all going to be lovingly handcrafted. Which means we'll work with Design and talk to them and come up with and idea for the systems. And it will definitely be interesting to have the systems that have had zero human interaction, or at least probably that mysterious human interaction, I don't know, like there's interesting things we can do where you find remnants of a old civilisation of humans that you didn't know had been there.AW: Potentially! Potentially!WW: So that'll be very different from a lot of the system lore we've been developing which is \"right, what has the impact of humans been on this system?\" But starting in fresh it means the backers will get to have a say in all those possible directions and what ends up winning out; or how that planet it either terraformed or not; or who are the settlers that take a ride on your Starliner out to that system. So it'll be really cool to see.AW: yeah I fully expect we might have an idea about what a system is going to be and then you guys will get in there and do something to it that we just never expected.

We shouldn't be continually applying thrust because we won't be suffering from the effects of drag to slow us down.Are there then factors that we don't know of that will slow us down or cause our thrusters to constantly be firing?", "answer": "The simple answer is no, actually we don't have any sort of elements that would retard your speed, so once you're moving at a certain speed, as long as you don't want to change your direction, you're not really firing your thrusters or using energy or stuff.Really the flight control system limits your speed at the low velocity stuff, which is where you would be dogfighting, purely because of g-force and pilot safety issues.And that's when you step up to autopilot or warp, where you're gonna move quickly in system, then it accelerates much faster, but then obviously in a straight line, and that's also why it pulls you out of autopilot or warp before you get close to another ship or other celestial body because at those kind of speeds, even .2 the speed of light, you just can't deviate your course quickly enough to avoid a collision without doing significant damage or killing the occupants, because you'd have to... It would be a lot of forces to even deviate a small amount at that sort of speed.So we are energy efficient, if you were at the top low-velocity that the IFCS sets and you're just going straight, it's not firing any thrusters. You're just basically cruising.

For me the best game creators, game programmers, have a programming background because essentially, programming is designing a system and how it's all gonna work, and you set the parameters. So yeah, I would guess Lead Programmer or Lead Designer would be mostly what it is.I mean when I started in the industry, projects weren't massive like Star Citizen is, so I was a band of one. I did the programming, I did the design, I did the graphics, I did the sound, I did the writing.But now, on something this massive you can't do all that, so of the stuff I'm doing more, I tend to do some hands-on coding, 'cause I'm kind of enjoying the design of some systems, and then just general overview of design.

That means we're running the servers, it's not a peer-to-peer sort of multiplayer typical kind of set-up that a lot of the first person shooter stuff could have. So the servers are our servers basically. So we get to see what's happening in every battle and we get to track metrics of this ship beats that ship while this weapon is stronger or too weak and all the rest of the stuff. So we'll have access to pretty much all the battle data because essentially the servers are run by us. Everyone else is just running a client connected to it and simulating local stuff that doesn't effect the master gameplay.
