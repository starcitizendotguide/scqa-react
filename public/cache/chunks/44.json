It premiered in SEY 2944, in the wake of a widely reported upon, three-month disappearance by Terrell. After his sudden reappearance, Terrell was fired by his former employers at the New United and established <em>Plain Truth</em>. The show is filmed on Terra (Terra III). It currently operates as an independent investigative unit, focusing on controversial and sensationalist Human interest and political stories. The show is often critical of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) government. </p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>Parker Terrell was an investigative journalist with the New United for 11 years, where he developed a reputation for often combative political stories. He was sometimes censured by his employers for taking too much of an editorial stance in his columns, but as his articles drew in audiences, he was retained. On 19 June 2943, Terrell appeared on the debate show <em>Showdown</em> where he asserted on the air that the UEE used an illegal super-weapon to destroy the surface of the planet Ellis XI. He disappeared less than a week later. A missing persons report was filed on 30 June. No note was found, and Terrell\u2019s personal ship was missing from its hangar. </p><br/><p>Terrell\u2019s ship was recovered from Vann (Croshaw III) on 10 August 2943. Terrell himself was discovered shortly after, on 16 September 2943. The Advocacy brought him in for questioning and released him on the same day. On 08 October 2943, Terrell appeared on <em>Showdown</em>, where he asserted that \u2018shadowy government agents\u2019 had chased him into hiding and repeated his accusation that the UEE had tested a planet-killing weapon on Ellis XI. After he refused to recant, the <em>New United</em> NewsOrg chose to terminate his contract.</p><br/><p>Terrell was hired by SSN/CAtv on 11 October 2943 to develop a news show. The first episode of <em>Plain Truth</em> premiered on 01 April 2944. In it, Terrell interviewed Daniel Warden, an independent courier who had been stopped by UEE Customs upon his entry in the Helios system and unlawfully detained for three weeks. During his imprisonment, Warden was questioned by Advocacy agents about people he had never met and about his activities in the Nexus system. Following Terrell\u2019s broadcast, Warden received an undisclosed amount of credits as compensation from the UEE for his detention. Since then, <em>Plain Truth</em> has run on a weekly basis, and has enjoyed moderate ratings. </p><br/><h1>CONTROVERSY</h1><br/><p>While <em>Plain Truth</em> is billed as a purely investigative journalism-centered program, there has been criticism from other news organizations that the show promotes conspiracy theories rather than fact. </p><br/><p>In 2945, Terrell interviewed Janis Tarkis, former journalist for the Terra Gazette. Tarkis asserted that the Galactic Aid Organization (GAO), a well-known charity that supplies those in need with cybernetic and artificial organs, had sold faulty organs on the black market for profit. After the episode aired, offices of the GAO across the UEE were inundated with comms accusing them of organ harvesting. Donations sharply dropped and multiple offices were vandalized.

The physics solver that solves collisions between objects does not cope that well when you are moving objects too forcibly through the world. You have to move them with forces, and accelerations and stuff to get the physics engine to solve the movement correctly. That also brings a whole bunch of other problems, because when you move the elevator with forces or acceleration all sorts of other stuff can move the elevator with forces and acceleration.

(For example, is the tail/cargo section being destroyed because that's where it was hit?) (B) Is the intention that we'll be able to survive something like that if we're not in the damaged section of the ship and have a spacesuit on? (C) And thirdly, do you have to consider the repair mechanic when designing damage states?", "answer": "Patrick Salerno: Yes. That is pretty much exactly how it works. What we're doing on the tech design side and this is going to get more in depth as we go too. You hit a specific location damage can transfer from that location to another location. There's probabilities. So if you hit like a wing and there's components under there, like shield generators or something. That can be damage and that creates a rippling explosion that goes and blows up something else.So we're trying to create a very dynamic damage system. So at a base level things break off, wings snap off, tails snap off, body snaps in half, three main parts well three or four is like nose, neck, body, tail. So when your ship is finally 100 percent destroyed if your neck is destroyed you're just boom! You just kind of blow up. But if your tail broke off you might still you know airlock, thunk, and try and coast back to base. It depends on how it's going. If you have a critical series of events that happen that might destroy your whole ship.Elwin Bachiller: Yeah. I mean if you trigger catastrophic damage it's game over!PS: Yeah it's game over your whole ship's going to blow up. So at the end yes there should be areas that you can see, especially like in non 100 percent destroyed state. You should be able to see exactly where you got hit during your fight. But at the end when your ship is blown up you know you got shot in the wing but it's listing, you didn't get shot in the tail.And then 100 percent is a complete model swap into the husk chunks at the moment with an overlay VFX that bursts out. It's all blended together so you can't really tell. But unless you're going back for repairs. You don't really need to see that one area where you got shot in the wing. It's all about performance. How can we keep realistic yet persistent damage?EB: The next part of this question is: Is the intention that we'll be able to something like that if we're not in the damaged section of the ship if we have a space suit on? I think you kind of touched on that?PS: I did kind of touch on that. Yes it is in the design board. Right now you just blow up and die. Your spaceship's blown up right? As the damage and how it transfers get more in depth we can end up just probably saying \"Airlock door closed you're all safe\". I don't know honestly I don't really have 100 percent specifics on that. But I do know conceptually it's possible and it's what we're leaning towards 'cause that's realistic right?EB: Yeah. I think that's ultimately the goal. Obviously game design is still working on the specifics of how that functions. Because as per the example the back of your ship gets blown off and that's where all your power plants are, and you're stuck in the front but you've got no power does that mean you're basically stuck on a floating husk? So there's more than just the realistic aspect of the game, we have to worry about what the implications for the gameplay are as well.Okay so the last part of Eschatos question is and thirdly, do you have to consider the repair mechanic when designing Damage States.EB/PS: Yes.PS: Yes you do because you have to think of what's going to need to be repaired, what's going to be left behind even if the mechanic isn't full implemented, you should still think how is the player going to repair this, which of the player will see, what tools are at his disposal. It's a big difference, just think conceptually, okay this isn't how it is or anything, but if you have a spaceship and it just flies into a hangar and a bunch of nanobots repair it or something that's one way where you don't have to be too interactive, but if you're a dude with a blowtorch and you're up there, the ship is a completely different spot; you're getting completely different visual, all sorts of stuff is going on.EB: Yeah. That repair mechanic is still being fleshed out.PS: Right.EB: I think it's going to be really cool. It's a lot more dynamic than what we had before. It's important to keep in mind our damage system is not what we started with. So we use the term damage states, but it doesn't actually reflect what it is anymore.PS: Right.EB: Right, It's a lot more organic than that. So previously we did have something called damage states where you'd shoot the wing and there would be four different version of the wing and different states of damage.PS: 25/50/70 and 100.EB: Exactly, that's gone. So the way we're doing it now is we're actually building the internal supports for that wing and when we shoot the whole surface it will blow a hole to through it to reveal the interior. There's no damage state, it's just how much damage has that part taken.PS: Correct and the only damage state is the really the 100 percent at this point. Are you destroyed or not?EB: Right.PS: And that's when you get the detach command and then boom the wing or tail goes flying off, but until then, it's mainly just the shader doing the work and it's hitting and it's rippling out and it's tearing apart and then it's transparent and you can see the metal ribbing of the inside of the ship and then that shows a more visual version of the wear. So it's less memory because you don't have four different models per separate part of the ship anymore that just has to do damage.EB: Right.PS: And it creates a better visual due to the way the shader works.EB: Yeah.PS: So I mean we're working on the pipeline all the time, optimizing the tech, coming up with new tech, implementing that and so far it's looking really cool.EB: Yeah it's very awesome and it's also a lot more satisfying to see the damage happen where you shoot.PS: Yes.EB: Whereas previously that wasn't the case. You could shoot the tip and the base of the piece would start to break off.", "published_at": "2016-03-21", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 07", "source": "https://youtu.be/9otSsylG3OI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Eschatos", "published_at_timestamp": 1458597254}, {"objectID": "373675650", "question": "What are the plans for 'Star Marine'?

I do actually kind of like to say something because I sort of get annoyed sometimes when I see this pop up in comments like \"Oh Star Marine is cancelled or Where's Star Marine!?\" Star Marine was just a game mode for people to play the FPS elements of Star Citizen until we could combine everything together: Flying, walking around, shooting, doing all the rest of the stuff, all together, that is what is in 2.0, that's what it's 2.1.With SC Alpha 2.0 onwards, you have basically what we were planning to do from Star Citizen and from the very very beginning. If you could back and look at the original pitch we didn't say \"Hey we're doing Star Marine,\" We said we will have FPS and Board, well you have FPS and you have boarding right now and so what's really happening is there will not be features that will only be for Star Marine outside a sort of competition match and scoring that isn't going to be in the game and so we're actually rolling out the FPS features.So 2.2 will have some more features on the FPS side and 2.3 will have some more and so on until we sort of what we consider the basic functionality. 2.2 has cover and some other things in it and we'll obviously have future, there's things like vaulting and sliding and different kind of stances that we have and there's a lot more weapons that we have and they're all getting rolled out and honing it and you guys are going to be able to play it in 2.2 and 2.3 and 2.4When we've got that basic set together we will sort of turn on the map for Star Marine because all Star Marine is, is a game mode. Basically allows you to play a game, have two teams, have some points and so you can just sort of have a Arena Commander style match, but for FPS. That's useful for you to hone your FPS skills without sort of being in the mini PU and risking some other stuff, but you already have FPS in the game so it's not like FPS got cancelled or anything like that.It's definitely in and Star Marine was originally our idea of how to get people to play the FPS before we could put everything together, but since that obviously took longer than we expected to get FPS to the level that we are comfortable with. By the time we got it to the level we said \"Okay you guys can play this.\" Well we already had all the other things combined with the Large World and the 64-bit coordinates and the zone system so that was it. So there you are, we will have Gold Horizon, we will have Star Marine, but that will come online once all the basic FPS features are out in and live in the mini PU.", "published_at": "2016-01-25", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 75", "source": "https://youtu.be/GGreb21dKdg", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Banjo", "published_at_timestamp": 1453762281}, {"objectID": "373682940", "answer": "Eric Kieron Davis: I really wanted to bring this one up immediately after that question because, even Forest just mentioned the skin, heads.

If there was a tier 0 how many more elements go into that head? Is it like 12 more layers compared to the tier..?FS: The tiers kind of reference that. We have higher polycounts, we have more bones and stuff like that in the face. So a little higher fidelity. Though those are mostly reserved for the cutscenes. Then we have our tier 1 which is the next level. The quality drops down a little bit. Though even our lowest quality is quite high.So all the characters even what we consider a stock character is high. There's not really such a thing as a stock character per se because we have scanned 120 heads or whatever. So they're all quite high quality and then we need to figure out different ways to take your 120 heads and customise them in different ways.

I've given the example of a factory needing 10T of ore, either a player or some AI can take that mission, they get attacked by pirates, the ship doesn't make their delivery, the factory doesn't make goods! It might put out another mission with protection, either hiring other NPCs or Players to escort the ship to make sure the 10T or ore gets through. All the AI have cause and reaction stuff that happens, whether that's something a player does or an AI does. SO a players action will have results within the economy. So if you're making a blockade, the economic nodes on the planet might hire more defences along with the original transport mission to help deal with the blockade.

I think we've had an engine tuning kit as one of our recent stretch goals we just hit, so yeah. That's all, long term, meant to be part of the game, and we're actually gonna try and get some of that in earlier.One of the big goals for me anyway is to try and get more of the items, various equipment that you can use, along with more of the base ships, out there for people to fly around in. Especially when the multiplayer combat happens, and also when we have the racing part of Arena Commander, because then it will really allow people to understand the tradeoffs and balances that you get with your items and equipment and balancing your energy, and weight and all the rest of the stuff. Which is all there, it's all in the system, but you don't really appreciate it right now because it's one default set of equipment on the three dogfighting ships that you use.And actually some of the items weren't set up. The 300i currently, though that will be fixed, has way too much power in its power plant, so it's always got way more power than all the items can use, which doesn't make sense. I would say that's something left over from when people were testing stuff and they wanted to check all the things were working and it never got fixed.So that will get fixed, that's why we're doing the early testing. Anyway, I think that will be fun, and I'm hoping people will actually have a cool sort of mini-game tweaking things, and also balancing things on the fly.", "published_at": "2014-06-30", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 27.

You've got some Hornets for the air superiority, then people coming with Gladiators and Retaliators to do the heavy damage. That would be the ideal way, but there definitely should be cases where you'd be able to inflict some damage even if you don't have the heavy guns like the Retaliator.It won't be like Wing Commander where you needed a capital ship torpedo to take out a capital ship, but you certainly won't be able to just put a bunch of laser blasts into an Idris corvette and expect it to blow up.We're modelling damage accurately, we're modeling the different parts of it accurately. So you're doing localized damage, and potentially some of that localized damage could be fairly impactful or crippling on the ship, but if you really want to split it in two, you probably have to put a ship torpedo into it.", "published_at": "2014-04-28", "title": "10 for the Chairman Episode 18.

(Even if I was doing awesome during my stint in the PU while the next episode was being developed.)", "answer": "It's probably unlikely that the Persistent Universe is going to be up and fully functioning by the time Squadron 42 is being played in an episodic manner.The whole concept of us to play Squadron 42 in an episodic manner is, we can't really give everyone the whole thing as a broken alpha because it's a story, so you'd ruin the story.So the idea is, we will have Squadron 42 in a more polished state when you first start playing it, but it'll only be the first 10 missions 'cause it takes so long to get all these things done and polished correctly. Then we're gonna run it more, think of it like episodic TV or a mini-series event. The team basically will be finishing and polishing the levels, then when they've got it done, they'll be pushing it out to all the backers out there.And that will be something you're playing while waiting for the full Persistent Universe to come up and running. We'll probably have an alpha or portions of the Persistent Universe, maybe a system or two that you can travel between, but in terms of having the full Persistent Universe that you can really go around and explore all the edges, that won't be until after Squadron 42 will be completed.The biggest thing we're doing is the Persistent Universe, it has the most amount of content, so that will definitely take the longest.Our roadmap really is:> Dogfighting, which we're working on right now to get Dogfighting v1 out, the single seater fighters.> Then Dogfighting v2, which will be the multi-crewed ships, the bigger things like the Constellation, Freelancer, and something like the Idris, although the Idris may not make Dogfighting v2 at the beginning and it would be a drop later.> Then after that, we would debut the First Person Combat section, which will probably have an alpha test level that's on an abandoned mining colony that's pretty cool that we're building right now.> And then there will be a combination [DFM v3/Boarding module] of that with the ships, so you can have dogfighting / ship boarding happening. You know, capture one big ship in the middle, then people have to do the fighter cover.> Then we'll probably have a Planet Side module,> And then at that point we will start to got to the episodic delivery of Squadron 42. The first 10 missions, then the next 10 missions,> And then at some point in that we would probably be giving some alpha of the Persistent Universe,> And then by the time Squadron 42's finished, hopefully the Persistent Universe will be ready at least in a beta format for all the backers.Then sometime after all that, all these things will be done and polished and we'll call it \"done.\" Although nothing's ever done in an online world 'cause we're always gonna be constantly tweaking and improving it.As far as that goes, you're not really going to be able to play Squadron 42 and then just drop out in the Persistent Universe between the 10 missions you're doing, 'cause you're in the military. It's just like time will have suspended for you when you come back and pick up the story where you left it off. Generally the losing paths that are in the segments of missions we're doing will be in that, whatever you want to call it, episode or whatever. They're fairly self-contained in terms of chapter segments, the different missions. So those probably, at the end of each one you've either failed and left the military, or you're bam onto the next thing, you've got a cliffhanger on what's happening in the next 10 episodes.That's kind of the structure that we've been working towards.", "published_at": "2014-04-03", "title": "10 for the Chairman - Episode 14 .

Whether they would actually exist as a persistent NPC, or they would maybe just exist in your own world view, or not at all, but you would know that they're retired and, I dunno, you would get an email every once in a while saying \"Drinking pina coladas on the beach.\"But this is a great idea, I don't know how easy it would be to work, but I guess you could always have a couple of NPC slots on a planet, and they're open to be populated by ex-player characters now operating as NPCs. That would be kind of cool because you would just basically take over the name and see them in there just going about their daily lives.So good suggestion, we'll think about that, you never know, it could happen.", "published_at": "2014-02-24", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 09 (2014.02.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Q4OB9Yfo-0Q", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Manic", "published_at_timestamp": 1393282759}, {"objectID": "373686180", "question": "Will we see greater access to weapons in preparation for the Dogfighting Module? Will we have access to different missiles, more guns and powerplants and engines? Will I finally get the cargo box for my Aurora?", "answer": "So definitely. As the Dogfighting Module rolls out and along the way we are going to be increasing the amount of weapons and munitions, etc. available to you. And items, like shields, thrusters, all the rest of the stuff. Because that's the whole point, it's to test out all these items, to do balance and all the rest of the stuff. We'll probably give you some sort of test money so people can buy something, try it for a day or two, then after they test it we take it back. So yes, the answer there is there will be a greater access and we'll be bringing them online as the assets are getting built Then on the \"Will I finally get the cargo box for my Aurora,\" I think if your Aurora is meant to have a cargo box it should already have it in the hangar. If not, then maybe that's a bug, so I'll have to check on that. I guess it would depend on what kind of Aurora you have and what the base stats say you've got.
