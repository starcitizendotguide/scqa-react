It was founded in SEY 2458 as a result of a merger between former news channels Sheridan Special News Television (SSNtv) and Communications Alliance (CA). It was the first news network to broadcast to all United Empire of Earth (UEE) planetary systems. While it currently has hundreds of affiliates and satellite offices, it primarily broadcasts out of Terra (Terra III).</p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>SSNtv was the first network originating from Earth (Sol III) to broadcast to Mars (Sol IV) and was the dominant news network among Humans until the discovery of the Croshaw system in 2271. As Human territory expanded to other planetary systems, SSNtv's reach narrowed due to limitations in communication technology. Content delivery delays of several days to several weeks were common between systems. Rival network CA was established on Reisse (Rhetor III) in 2398 to combat this gap. Thanks to the Rhetor system's cutting-edge communications network, CA\u2019s reach expanded more quickly than SSNtv's, and the network began to struggle. In 2458, SSNtv accepted a merger proposal from CA and SSN/CAtv was born.</p><br/><p>SSN/CAtv initially transmitted a continuous stream of news, hosted by a rotating cast of anchors. It gradually increased its focus on politics, purchasing Showdown! in 2522 as its keystone debate program. This shift in content brought high profits with it, enabling the network to open a new headquarters on Cestulus (Davien II) in 2525. In 2529, SSN/CAtv provided on-the-ground coverage of the Unified Currency Riot in Jata, Cestulus, including its quelling by the United Planets of Earth (UPE)  military. After first contact with the Xi'an in 2530 and discovery of the Tevarin in 2541, the network\u2019s content began to gradually lean pro-war and anti-alien. </p><br/><p>Upon the ascension of Ivar Messer I to the office of Prime Citizen in 2546, SSN/CAtv\u2019s content took a hard pro-government shift. The host and crew of <em>Showdown!</em> were fired and replaced after they aired a special episode urging people to act against Messer's consolidation of power. Deacon Messer II became one of the network's prime shareholders in 2601. After this point, SSN/CAtv became one of the cornerstones of the United Empire of Earth's (UEE) propaganda machine. </p><br/><p>In 2630, SSN/CAtv relocated to an expansive headquarters on Terra. The network slowly began to allow some UEE-critical content to air, while still maintaining a pro-Messer stance in the majority of its programming. For example, SSN/CAtv played a pivotal role in discrediting Terran Senator Assan Kieren's reputation during his call for Terran sovereignty in 2638, but it also allowed its pundit and debate programs to feature anti-military and pro-secession guests. </p><br/><p>During the power struggle between Astrid Messer VII and Samuel Messer VIII, reporters on multiple shows stepped too far out of line, harshly criticizing the Messers for their infighting. In 2699, Astrid Messer VII retaliated by conducting mass arrests and censoring over half the network\u2019s programming into cancellation. Samuel Messer VIII rescinded the mass censorship upon taking office in 2701, but ordered that all content aired henceforth on the network had to be approved by the Imperator's office. Those imprisoned by Astrid Messer VII were not pardoned, and were forced to serve out the remainder of their sentences. </p><br/><h1>ROLE IN THE DEPOSITION OF THE MESSER REGIME</h1><br/><p>Anonymous SSN/CAtv insiders began organizing with anti-Messer activists as early as 2702. They aided the resistance in two key ways: they allowed the rebels to pass along encrypted messages via the network's communications arrays, and fed them information uncensored by the Messer government. Once such piece of information was footage from the Massacre of Garron II. On 11 April 2792, technicians responsible for the network feed allowed footage of the Massacre, along with a message from the resistance group Tide, to interrupt a broadcast of SSN/CAtv Nightly News. This broadcast was the inciting incident of the revolution that would eventually depose the Messer regime.</p><br/><h1>TODAY</h1><br/><p>SSN/CAtv hosts a wide variety of news and news-related content. Some of their flagship programs include pure news shows Empire Report and SSN/CAtv Nightly News, the pundit-centered debate program <em>Showdown!</em> and the UEE-critical talk show Plain Truth. It has satellite offices on most recognized planets in the UEE.

Are we going to get as crazy as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons?", "answer": "I mean, hurricanes and typhoons are the same thing. Just different names depending on where you are on the planet. It's just like very strong winds. And from orbit you have this giant circling weather front moving around. We might not be able to do it like that from orbit. We'll definitely be able to turn up the knob a little bit on what our weather looks like. Compared to what you've seen at CitizenCon. Obviously needs a lot of work from different departments to make this all a coherent experience. Tornadoes, it's not really a weather cloud thing. They move at a very different rate and the clouds will be able to move. So it would be more on VFX and graphics. I don't want to commit them to do anything that they might not be able to support anytime soon. But yeah, definitely we will have certain planets with cyclones on them. If they will move the way they do in nature, we need to see how far we can push the system. Or if they will be a little bit less. But yeah, I don't know yet. We'll see. We're still learning. We're still working with the data and the tools. Expanding them, exploring them, making better data. You can expect a lot of iteration for the weather over the next few months and maybe years.

One of the first things that came up when we first implemented a prototype of this was that when you walk away from somebody speaking and you start to see the lip sync go out, that's kind of like, it's realistic, but people have seen movies oft enough that they don't expect it. So we have to strike a balance between realism and the experience people are a little more used to on screen. There's also the challenge of camera zoom, that's huge. So when the camera's zoomed in and the audio listener is actually significantly further away than it appears on screen, that causes problems, so we're having to overcome some of that as well.

You might find that mixing together like some random bits of armor get you exactly what you want, for a very specific situation. But for instance, we're gonna have these full suit kind of features. So there'll be systems and even just kind of weight, you know, the mass support, these things clip together. So right now, for instance, you can put on like a heavy backpack, heavy core, heavy arms, heavy helmet, and then absolutely no trousers, right? Just run around with you.  Feeble little legs, somehow holding all that up, and you will be faster currently than if you wore leg armor. So that's going. Like your puny little legs won't be able to carry the weight of that because we're making all armors heavier as well. So you will need the support of this leg armor to make that viable.

They tried to use inverse kinematics and it created more problems than it solved. In general, the idea is to accurately model its physics (which they do not do right now). The physics solver that solves collisions between objects does not cope that well when you are moving objects too forcibly through the world. You have to move them with forces, and accelerations and stuff to get the physics engine to solve the movement correctly. That also brings a whole bunch of other problems, because when you move the elevator with forces or acceleration all sorts of other stuff can move the elevator with forces and acceleration. They have been making strides towards it. They have a similar situation with transit carriages (i.e. trains and elevators) which are similar setup, so that they have the correct collision behaviour.

(For example, is the tail/cargo section being destroyed because that's where it was hit?) (B) Is the intention that we'll be able to survive something like that if we're not in the damaged section of the ship and have a spacesuit on? (C) And thirdly, do you have to consider the repair mechanic when designing damage states?", "answer": "Patrick Salerno: Yes. That is pretty much exactly how it works. What we're doing on the tech design side and this is going to get more in depth as we go too. You hit a specific location damage can transfer from that location to another location. There's probabilities. So if you hit like a wing and there's components under there, like shield generators or something. That can be damage and that creates a rippling explosion that goes and blows up something else.So we're trying to create a very dynamic damage system. So at a base level things break off, wings snap off, tails snap off, body snaps in half, three main parts well three or four is like nose, neck, body, tail. So when your ship is finally 100 percent destroyed if your neck is destroyed you're just boom! You just kind of blow up. But if your tail broke off you might still you know airlock, thunk, and try and coast back to base. It depends on how it's going. If you have a critical series of events that happen that might destroy your whole ship.Elwin Bachiller: Yeah. I mean if you trigger catastrophic damage it's game over!PS: Yeah it's game over your whole ship's going to blow up. So at the end yes there should be areas that you can see, especially like in non 100 percent destroyed state. You should be able to see exactly where you got hit during your fight. But at the end when your ship is blown up you know you got shot in the wing but it's listing, you didn't get shot in the tail.And then 100 percent is a complete model swap into the husk chunks at the moment with an overlay VFX that bursts out. It's all blended together so you can't really tell. But unless you're going back for repairs. You don't really need to see that one area where you got shot in the wing. It's all about performance. How can we keep realistic yet persistent damage?EB: The next part of this question is: Is the intention that we'll be able to something like that if we're not in the damaged section of the ship if we have a space suit on? I think you kind of touched on that?PS: I did kind of touch on that. Yes it is in the design board. Right now you just blow up and die. Your spaceship's blown up right? As the damage and how it transfers get more in depth we can end up just probably saying \"Airlock door closed you're all safe\". I don't know honestly I don't really have 100 percent specifics on that. But I do know conceptually it's possible and it's what we're leaning towards 'cause that's realistic right?EB: Yeah. I think that's ultimately the goal. Obviously game design is still working on the specifics of how that functions. Because as per the example the back of your ship gets blown off and that's where all your power plants are, and you're stuck in the front but you've got no power does that mean you're basically stuck on a floating husk? So there's more than just the realistic aspect of the game, we have to worry about what the implications for the gameplay are as well.Okay so the last part of Eschatos question is and thirdly, do you have to consider the repair mechanic when designing Damage States.EB/PS: Yes.PS: Yes you do because you have to think of what's going to need to be repaired, what's going to be left behind even if the mechanic isn't full implemented, you should still think how is the player going to repair this, which of the player will see, what tools are at his disposal. It's a big difference, just think conceptually, okay this isn't how it is or anything, but if you have a spaceship and it just flies into a hangar and a bunch of nanobots repair it or something that's one way where you don't have to be too interactive, but if you're a dude with a blowtorch and you're up there, the ship is a completely different spot; you're getting completely different visual, all sorts of stuff is going on.EB: Yeah. That repair mechanic is still being fleshed out.PS: Right.EB: I think it's going to be really cool. It's a lot more dynamic than what we had before. It's important to keep in mind our damage system is not what we started with. So we use the term damage states, but it doesn't actually reflect what it is anymore.PS: Right.EB: Right, It's a lot more organic than that. So previously we did have something called damage states where you'd shoot the wing and there would be four different version of the wing and different states of damage.PS: 25/50/70 and 100.EB: Exactly, that's gone. So the way we're doing it now is we're actually building the internal supports for that wing and when we shoot the whole surface it will blow a hole to through it to reveal the interior. There's no damage state, it's just how much damage has that part taken.PS: Correct and the only damage state is the really the 100 percent at this point. Are you destroyed or not?EB: Right.PS: And that's when you get the detach command and then boom the wing or tail goes flying off, but until then, it's mainly just the shader doing the work and it's hitting and it's rippling out and it's tearing apart and then it's transparent and you can see the metal ribbing of the inside of the ship and then that shows a more visual version of the wear. So it's less memory because you don't have four different models per separate part of the ship anymore that just has to do damage.EB: Right.PS: And it creates a better visual due to the way the shader works.EB: Yeah.PS: So I mean we're working on the pipeline all the time, optimizing the tech, coming up with new tech, implementing that and so far it's looking really cool.EB: Yeah it's very awesome and it's also a lot more satisfying to see the damage happen where you shoot.PS: Yes.EB: Whereas previously that wasn't the case. You could shoot the tip and the base of the piece would start to break off.", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 07", "source": "https://youtu.be/9otSsylG3OI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Eschatos", "published_at_timestamp": 1458597254}, {"objectID": "373675650", "question": "What are the plans for 'Star Marine'? I know we have FPS mechanics in 2.1, but I'm curious whether the stand alone module with Gold Horizon is still in the pipeline.", "answer": "So yes it is still in the pipeline. I do actually kind of like to say something because I sort of get annoyed sometimes when I see this pop up in comments like \"Oh Star Marine is cancelled or Where's Star Marine!?\" Star Marine was just a game mode for people to play the FPS elements of Star Citizen until we could combine everything together: Flying, walking around, shooting, doing all the rest of the stuff, all together, that is what is in 2.0, that's what it's 2.1.With SC Alpha 2.0 onwards, you have basically what we were planning to do from Star Citizen and from the very very beginning. If you could back and look at the original pitch we didn't say \"Hey we're doing Star Marine,\" We said we will have FPS and Board, well you have FPS and you have boarding right now and so what's really happening is there will not be features that will only be for Star Marine outside a sort of competition match and scoring that isn't going to be in the game and so we're actually rolling out the FPS features.So 2.2 will have some more features on the FPS side and 2.3 will have some more and so on until we sort of what we consider the basic functionality. 2.2 has cover and some other things in it and we'll obviously have future, there's things like vaulting and sliding and different kind of stances that we have and there's a lot more weapons that we have and they're all getting rolled out and honing it and you guys are going to be able to play it in 2.2 and 2.3 and 2.4When we've got that basic set together we will sort of turn on the map for Star Marine because all Star Marine is, is a game mode. Basically allows you to play a game, have two teams, have some points and so you can just sort of have a Arena Commander style match, but for FPS. That's useful for you to hone your FPS skills without sort of being in the mini PU and risking some other stuff, but you already have FPS in the game so it's not like FPS got cancelled or anything like that.It's definitely in and Star Marine was originally our idea of how to get people to play the FPS before we could put everything together, but since that obviously took longer than we expected to get FPS to the level that we are comfortable with. By the time we got it to the level we said \"Okay you guys can play this.\" Well we already had all the other things combined with the Large World and the 64-bit coordinates and the zone system so that was it. So there you are, we will have Gold Horizon, we will have Star Marine, but that will come online once all the basic FPS features are out in and live in the mini PU.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 75", "source": "https://youtu.be/GGreb21dKdg", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Banjo", "published_at_timestamp": 1453762281}, {"objectID": "373682940", "answer": "Eric Kieron Davis: I really wanted to bring this one up immediately after that question because, even Forest just mentioned the skin, heads.

Yeah. You got anything else you want to add to that?Forrest Stephan: No. I think you've pretty much answered that. We have our tier 0's which are our less expensive heads, and highest quality heads and our main actors.EKD: I guess, to extend this one. Sorry I didn't want to interrupt. If there was a tier 0 how many more elements go into that head? Is it like 12 more layers compared to the tier..?FS: The tiers kind of reference that. We have higher polycounts, we have more bones and stuff like that in the face. So a little higher fidelity. Though those are mostly reserved for the cutscenes. Then we have our tier 1 which is the next level. The quality drops down a little bit. Though even our lowest quality is quite high.So all the characters even what we consider a stock character is high. There's not really such a thing as a stock character per se because we have scanned 120 heads or whatever. So they're all quite high quality and then we need to figure out different ways to take your 120 heads and customise them in different ways. So we did a pretty good job of creating one that would require stock characters and still having them very custom and very unique and high quality and stuff like that.", "published_at_timestamp": 1453161882, "question": "How is the art pipeline different for the minor NPC characters compared to the more important ones, and will the NPC characters that we see in the bazaars and around town be getting real individual attention, or be more stock characters?", "source": "https://youtu.be/GQWAhnF55CY", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 03", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "EarthFyre", "time": "20m55s"}, {"objectID": "373680050", "question": "As an IT geek I would like to know more about the server infrastructure.

I'm not really going to talk about that much as far as that goes, we use a lot of Cisco stuff if that helps. We do on every one of our studios we have sort of a replicated server set up and we use very fast storage so we use this thing called Nimble storage and our big challenge...I mean every one of our studios has gigabit internet connection and we replicate drives perforce depots are various different shared drives between every one of the studios constantly so that way people can put up on our local network drive saying, 'I captured this little movie of the game action' and it will be replicated to all our different studios.There are terabytes and terabytes of data just going back and forth all the time between our studios. It is a lot of data that is getting shunted around, we rely a lot on having a nice wide connection to the internet and fast storage, we have very fast state of the art servers and there you go. Of course the game itself runs in the cloud, right now we're on Google Compute so we deploy up to the cloud from here. So, there you go, I don't know if that gave you as much of a question but hopefully a little bit of it. The challenges are basically shunting all the data around and keeping everyone in sync which for all the data we deal in game making is quite a lot of data. It's fairly painful if you're outside one of our studios syncing from a home machine and don't have a fast internet connection it will take a long time to sync up your build.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 71", "source": "https://youtu.be/QNGq1BkPINU", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "IggyPi", "published_at_timestamp": 1449529998}, {"objectID": "2efc7742781d3_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The Starliner is not a racing ship and would, at a cruising speed, be somewhere in the middle range.

I've given the example of a factory needing 10T of ore, either a player or some AI can take that mission, they get attacked by pirates, the ship doesn't make their delivery, the factory doesn't make goods! It might put out another mission with protection, either hiring other NPCs or Players to escort the ship to make sure the 10T or ore gets through. All the AI have cause and reaction stuff that happens, whether that's something a player does or an AI does. SO a players action will have results within the economy. So if you're making a blockade, the economic nodes on the planet might hire more defences along with the original transport mission to help deal with the blockade.

I think we've had an engine tuning kit as one of our recent stretch goals we just hit, so yeah. That's all, long term, meant to be part of the game, and we're actually gonna try and get some of that in earlier.One of the big goals for me anyway is to try and get more of the items, various equipment that you can use, along with more of the base ships, out there for people to fly around in. Especially when the multiplayer combat happens, and also when we have the racing part of Arena Commander, because then it will really allow people to understand the tradeoffs and balances that you get with your items and equipment and balancing your energy, and weight and all the rest of the stuff. Which is all there, it's all in the system, but you don't really appreciate it right now because it's one default set of equipment on the three dogfighting ships that you use.And actually some of the items weren't set up. The 300i currently, though that will be fixed, has way too much power in its power plant, so it's always got way more power than all the items can use, which doesn't make sense. I would say that's something left over from when people were testing stuff and they wanted to check all the things were working and it never got fixed.So that will get fixed, that's why we're doing the early testing. Anyway, I think that will be fun, and I'm hoping people will actually have a cool sort of mini-game tweaking things, and also balancing things on the fly.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 27.

You've got some Hornets for the air superiority, then people coming with Gladiators and Retaliators to do the heavy damage. That would be the ideal way, but there definitely should be cases where you'd be able to inflict some damage even if you don't have the heavy guns like the Retaliator.It won't be like Wing Commander where you needed a capital ship torpedo to take out a capital ship, but you certainly won't be able to just put a bunch of laser blasts into an Idris corvette and expect it to blow up.We're modelling damage accurately, we're modeling the different parts of it accurately. So you're doing localized damage, and potentially some of that localized damage could be fairly impactful or crippling on the ship, but if you really want to split it in two, you probably have to put a ship torpedo into it.", "title": "10 for the Chairman Episode 18.

(Even if I was doing awesome during my stint in the PU while the next episode was being developed.)", "answer": "It's probably unlikely that the Persistent Universe is going to be up and fully functioning by the time Squadron 42 is being played in an episodic manner.The whole concept of us to play Squadron 42 in an episodic manner is, we can't really give everyone the whole thing as a broken alpha because it's a story, so you'd ruin the story.So the idea is, we will have Squadron 42 in a more polished state when you first start playing it, but it'll only be the first 10 missions 'cause it takes so long to get all these things done and polished correctly. Then we're gonna run it more, think of it like episodic TV or a mini-series event. The team basically will be finishing and polishing the levels, then when they've got it done, they'll be pushing it out to all the backers out there.And that will be something you're playing while waiting for the full Persistent Universe to come up and running. We'll probably have an alpha or portions of the Persistent Universe, maybe a system or two that you can travel between, but in terms of having the full Persistent Universe that you can really go around and explore all the edges, that won't be until after Squadron 42 will be completed.The biggest thing we're doing is the Persistent Universe, it has the most amount of content, so that will definitely take the longest.Our roadmap really is:> Dogfighting, which we're working on right now to get Dogfighting v1 out, the single seater fighters.> Then Dogfighting v2, which will be the multi-crewed ships, the bigger things like the Constellation, Freelancer, and something like the Idris, although the Idris may not make Dogfighting v2 at the beginning and it would be a drop later.> Then after that, we would debut the First Person Combat section, which will probably have an alpha test level that's on an abandoned mining colony that's pretty cool that we're building right now.> And then there will be a combination [DFM v3/Boarding module] of that with the ships, so you can have dogfighting / ship boarding happening. You know, capture one big ship in the middle, then people have to do the fighter cover.> Then we'll probably have a Planet Side module,> And then at that point we will start to got to the episodic delivery of Squadron 42. The first 10 missions, then the next 10 missions,> And then at some point in that we would probably be giving some alpha of the Persistent Universe,> And then by the time Squadron 42's finished, hopefully the Persistent Universe will be ready at least in a beta format for all the backers.Then sometime after all that, all these things will be done and polished and we'll call it \"done.\" Although nothing's ever done in an online world 'cause we're always gonna be constantly tweaking and improving it.As far as that goes, you're not really going to be able to play Squadron 42 and then just drop out in the Persistent Universe between the 10 missions you're doing, 'cause you're in the military. It's just like time will have suspended for you when you come back and pick up the story where you left it off. Generally the losing paths that are in the segments of missions we're doing will be in that, whatever you want to call it, episode or whatever. They're fairly self-contained in terms of chapter segments, the different missions. So those probably, at the end of each one you've either failed and left the military, or you're bam onto the next thing, you've got a cliffhanger on what's happening in the next 10 episodes.That's kind of the structure that we've been working towards.", "title": "10 for the Chairman - Episode 14 .

Whether they would actually exist as a persistent NPC, or they would maybe just exist in your own world view, or not at all, but you would know that they're retired and, I dunno, you would get an email every once in a while saying \"Drinking pina coladas on the beach.\"But this is a great idea, I don't know how easy it would be to work, but I guess you could always have a couple of NPC slots on a planet, and they're open to be populated by ex-player characters now operating as NPCs. That would be kind of cool because you would just basically take over the name and see them in there just going about their daily lives.So good suggestion, we'll think about that, you never know, it could happen.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 09 (2014.02.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Q4OB9Yfo-0Q", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Manic", "published_at_timestamp": 1393282759}, {"objectID": "373686180", "question": "Will we see greater access to weapons in preparation for the Dogfighting Module? Will we have access to different missiles, more guns and powerplants and engines? Will I finally get the cargo box for my Aurora?", "answer": "So definitely. As the Dogfighting Module rolls out and along the way we are going to be increasing the amount of weapons and munitions, etc. available to you. And items, like shields, thrusters, all the rest of the stuff. Because that's the whole point, it's to test out all these items, to do balance and all the rest of the stuff. We'll probably give you some sort of test money so people can buy something, try it for a day or two, then after they test it we take it back. So yes, the answer there is there will be a greater access and we'll be bringing them online as the assets are getting built Then on the \"Will I finally get the cargo box for my Aurora,\" I think if your Aurora is meant to have a cargo box it should already have it in the hangar. If not, then maybe that's a bug, so I'll have to check on that. I guess it would depend on what kind of Aurora you have and what the base stats say you've got.
