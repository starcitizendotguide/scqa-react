If you want to get more interesting or more lucrative ones then you\u2019ll have to build your rep up whether it\u2019s going to be with a merchant\u2019s guild or someone that\u2019s a cargo broker or something like that. Much like the mission giver that we sort of showed at GamesCom last year, we\u2019ll have characters out there that will be giving you sort of higher grade missions that pay better, that are maybe a bit more interesting, a bit more challenging. So you sort of have to kind of prove your mettle and then you get a certain rep as you were saying and you can move onto the more interesting missions. If you just want to haul cargo and you\u2019ve got a Freelancer, yeah you absolutely be able to start doing that and then it\u2019s up to you how far you want to go in that profession.     <br /><br />TZ: So, there\u2019s a lot of the smaller ships to where you could potentially fit a small number of crates, 4,6,8, 20 crates. The amount of cargo you can haul is obviously going to affect what type of thing you might be looking to transport, in other words\u2026 I mentioned earlier, illegal liquors and stuff which you know a dozen crates of that could actually have a pretty hefty profit margins. When you\u2019re talking about hauling commodities, probably not so much. You\u2019re usually talking about\u2026 unless you\u2019re talking about some of the more valuable ones, you\u2019re usually talking about greater quantities, you need a larger ships\u2026 those ships in general tend to move slower therefore you may want a security escort and on and on and on.", "title": "Star Citizen: 10 for the Chairman - Professions in Alpha 3.0", "source": "https://youtu.be/Uhra2SETLNs", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Dr_Murray", "time": "43m25s", "published_at_timestamp": 1489533309}, {"objectID": "373686870", "question": "What is a Junior Sound Designer?", "answer": "It's a varied job that involves handling all different kinds of aspects of the game that uses sounds.

Other than persistence and the recent focus on Squadron 42 development; what is the biggest development challenge preventing rudimentary versions of the exploration, cargo, mining and economy mechanics to be implemented into the PU/PTU builds and would it be possible to see targeted or focused updates on these specific mechanics in the future?", "answer": "Yes.So these are all things that we are focusing on. So 2.4 has just come out so that has persistence which is a pretty big thing because that just means that the items that you buy, or potentially find, will stay around; and then longer term health and damage, and wear and tear to your items and all the rest of stuff, will also persist; and you can buy and sell things like clothes now. And we're just going to be opening up and expanding more and more of that.And then the other big thing that we are doing is we're working quite hard on having ... what we .. Stanton system, that we're going to put in an a system ... massive scale, I think the system itself is going to be, in our scaled down version, about a billion kilometres across which is pretty insanely big. And we will be ... in the ... not immediate future but definitely this year we will have the Stanton system there with procedural planets and that's one of our focuses.So right now what we are doing is we are focusing on the procedural planet tech and work. And also the fundamental things that we have to do to the underlying engine tech to allow us simulate a system that is that big. So we're already simulating a pretty massive play area, but the full star system is much, much, much, much, much bigger than you get even now in Crusader. And is going to have .. it has vast amounts of objects or entities if you want to call them.So you probably would have noticed that performance from 2.3 to 2.4 has degraded a little bit. And that has been an ongoing trend because we've been adding more things in: more AI; more things, so like if you go to Port Olisar you can buy items in the shops and you also have various pick up ... wreck ... like things you can pick up at wrecks around Yella and all that. And so essentially the core of CryEngine was never built to simulate this many items and objects, and we've had a long term refactor that we've been working on, the Item 2.0 that keeps on getting mentioned is one of the core ones ... part of it, but we're basically refactoring the way the whole entity system updates; we're refactoring the fundamental ...So we've done a lot of top level changes on top of the CryNetwork but it's just not going to be good enough handle systems this big and this much data going back and forth. So we've long had a full rewrite of everything in CryNetwork on the table and we've been working on it and now with what happened, and what you could see on 2.4 and the framerates and everything it's just clear we're at the limit of what the current engine will handle without these new systems that we've been working on for quite a while coming online.So the Engineering team on the overall project, across all the studios, have a good portion of it being what we call \"ring fenced\". And so rather than spending a lot of time iterating, fixing issues or bugs on 2.4 or 2.4.1 or 2.5, we've been working towards getting everything in place for when we bring out the bigger system and procedural planets. Which internally in our release schedule that will be 2.7 but I'm not giving you an exact date on that because as you can see with 2.4 some of the bigger things take longer some of the more simple content updates.But we're working it ... pulling all of it together and when that's in place, with some of the systems and some of the messaging and organisation stuff we've got in the works, which is also pretty cool that longer term we'll be rolling out later this year that will also make the game much better in terms of coordinating with your friends and groups and organisations; we will have the foundation in place to really accelerate on things like the cargo and the mining and going about and hiring other people to escort you or defend you or take someone out.So that's all working at pace and then in the short term we're working it, adding some content in terms of new locations. So in the next big drop we have ... we were going to have a separate area which when you're an outlaw, someone on the wrong side of the law, you have your own place where you spawn and you ... So it's almost like we're going to have two factions in the 2.5 release which is the outlaw base and then Port Olisar will be the two main spawning places. And we're going to start to build that up and there's some extra stuff that gets added there and we're going to have some other gameplay that rolls out that's on the smaller side but then the huge system expansion starts with 2.7 ... won't have all the locations because there's a lot of stuff to be there but everything will be in placeholder set up in 2.7 and then we start working it like fleshing and finishing out Stanton system.So that's our goal. Our goal is to get the Stanton system fleshed out to the fidelity that we want in Star Citizen for playing the game the way we imagined it at the amount of like insane detail you can go from ... basically it's that \"Pupil to Planet\" detail where you can get right down there and you can walking around on this huge planet and the detail on the ground is like something you've never ... I promise you it's something you have not seen on a proper fully procedural planet that's fully three ... like a proper sphere. Like you'll see the planet, you'll keep going, it's all completely seamless you get down, you get right down, you get down, you see the little rocks on the ... on the ground. And I haven't seen anyone else been able to do that. So we are going to do that. That's going to be very cool, I think you guys will like it. So that coming on down the road. Again can't really give exact dates because some of these things take longer than we would all like but this year is the plan so stay tuned and, you know, that's another reason to come to GamesCom because we may have some stuff to show.", "title": "Star Citizen: 10 for the Chairman - Episode 85", "source": "https://youtu.be/9IubH4hHIFw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Geforce", "published_at_timestamp": 1466460877}, {"objectID": "fb392c22e6140_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The S1 mounts will be capable of firing full guidance missiles.

We have a few designs of what might replace it, though nothing is set in stone yet, we're playing around with it. One of the obvious issues with the current system is that it doesn't even localise. In the French version for example it still says \"USE\"! I don't know what USE is in French, but I feel like we could do better. Everything is animated, so I'd expect to see the player doing animations that interact with objects in the world.

I'm sure lots of people will go \"Space weed!\". But there'll be plenty of other things too.So it's a sort of farming mechanic so you would have that in space. You would maintain it like perhaps you would have to take the, your ship would have to be a certain distance from the local system star or you may have to fend for it make sure it's grown in perhaps the lower gravity setup, makes you able to grow a better strain of whatever it would be: wheat, etc. So there you go.I don't know about bacon farming. Bacon farming I'm guessing is: ok we're going to have pigs or cows or something like that. I would think at some point we may do livestock but I would definitely say in the first iteration or two we probably won't do it just 'cause of the issues of: ok now i've got a bio-dome full of 20 cows or something.

So...Darian Vorlick: I'm thinking behind hidden panels,things like that. How about a fake fuel cap?KT: Yep! Smuggling is a topic that has come up for piracy or just being able to stow equipment safely for you, on your ship. That is a topic we're in the midst of discussion for. There was a pass on components for each of the component types, they were mostly done by, they were spearheaded by Elwin who took the, metrics that we use for the ships and for any of the buildings in FPS, the...DV: We're talking what metrics? Volume, length?KT: Right. These are the standard minimum doorway size that we have on the ship. The standard minimum walkway path that we need. Things like seats, turret sizes, weapons, any of these components we took a look at them and decided \"Ok\". A size one small component should be roughly this size, and no bigger than that size. So we took the maximum allowable size for the component and ensured that all those components fit that size, fit neatly in that box. So everythings boxed, box shape.That way we can ensure that when we build a ship that has a physicalised component when we swap out a size one, say radar, then we can actually implement another size one radar in the same space without having to have custom geo just for that enclosure, and that ensures the swapability of components and allows us to make components that are unique enough to, make you want to get a different type of component to suit a different need.DV: So it's actually something that we've discussed in the past where we're finally starting to see it come to fruition as the standardised modularity. You might have heard some of us talking on previous Ten for the Producers and Ten for the Designers that we've been look at trying to create standardisation for these sizes for a long time.And that was something that was spearheaded by Elwin. By creating standard bounty boxes you create a template for every single size one, every single size two because now we have a range measurements that we can utilise to put those onKT: Right, and that's important for us as Designers because when we're implementing a ship in whitebox we can take these bounds that we create for the ships and we know that this is going to require a size 2 component of this type. We need to ensure that it is placed in the ship roughly around here. Well we'll need access to it, because the ship does have an interior so we can communicate to the Artist that there needs to be a core goal or some kind of wall in which there is a panel that we can access this so when we go to actually repair it or swap it out or salvage it, if you're a pirate!There is the capability to physically access that object. What's also interesting about that is when we eventually have the ability to damage these components from the outside, so we'll have gameplay and you're shooting up a ship from the outside you know you can target the shield generator because you can take the shields down. Well you know where that is roughly in the ship you can start shooting around it,and you will know that it does embody a physical location on the ship, and you know where to target that particular component.On a converse when it is destroyed you will also know on the ship. The engineering can tell you, \"Hey get on down to hallway A and repair the shield generator\". That crew member will know exactly where to go, which panel to pop open and which component to repair.DV: Or in your cargo hold you could have a whole crate full of different shield generators. Your engineer runs down, take one out, go run back to the cargo, grabs the new one and throws it in there. So not actually fixing it but replacing it as wellKT: Right. So that's just part one of the question, part two was: what are the.... Are we going to allow rechangeability of components? In general no. So most components will be in a specific spot, slot put together for that component. Some of the component types though, such as ammo, fuel, I think there was one more. I can't remember off the top of my head but there is a category of components in which you can choose to fit anyone of those types, that fit in that particular range of components in that slot.So if we do have say a smuggling hold that is placeable on our pirate themed ships. That is a component type you can choose to fit onto that ship. If however if you really want to on the same ship, fit it for longer quantum travel or further distance. Maybe you'll choose a quantum fuel or a regular fuel canister instead. If you really want to fit out a ship with a lot of weaponry, well let's put an ammo box in there instead. So there is a category of component types that we are implementing in the near future. However for the most part components will fit into their actual designed slot.DV: I just thought of it's like a ship USB systemKT: Yeah. Not quite that modular!DV: But at the same time. Let's say you have one labelled as a fuel tank and technicality it's actually a cargo hold. If let's say a player's a police officer that's trying to investigate this pirate ship and he see's a fuel tank there, well he knows pirates tend to use these as cargo holds. I remember hearing someone discussing about being able to scam them and be able to trick scammers as well?KT: That is something that we'll have to design and implement but yeah, sureDV: Something way down the road!KT: Yeah. We can also design say a cargo hold that does disguise itself as a...DV: Fuel tank or an ammo boxKT: Fuel tank. And it actually has that, when we implement that actual scanning gameplay, perhaps there's a way in that it actually mimics the actual, the component that it's trying to pretend to be that way you can smuggle, or use it as a smoke ring canister, because we're only going to make a finite number of ships and so there's no way that we can say that \"Hey we can randomly generate these smuggling holds\".So each ship if you take a minute to study you'll know that \"Hey it's a capability of it having this smuggling hold\". So let's figure out gameplay in which you can make use of that item and still get away with that gameplay by giving us the capability to whoever is trying to scan that particular item.DV: If you use a car analogue. No matter how many Ford Mustangs you look at, you're going to know where the engine is every single time.KT: Right.", "published_at_timestamp": 1456181823, "question": "How did you decide how to size the components for the components system?

We have our pipeline fleshed out in excruciating detail for art and design which is fantastic. I took a break from working on our til the end of the year components schedule to come down here and do this. We've been having a lot of meetings about it. We have at least a first pass concept of every component type in at least one size, so we have an idea of what the norms are going to be and the visual cues, because obviously the smallest and largest size shield generator are going to look very different. But we're hoping to have visual cues in there so you can look at either one and say, 'Oh, that's a shield generator', right away.

Generally you can categorize them and say - ships for example, ships will probably, if it's this ship or that ship will probably spend commensurate ratios of time in each step of the pipeline. If it's this radar system versus this missile system, yeah, it gets a little more nebulous. So, I guess I think a ship would be a good one to break down to answer his question. So what percentage of time was spent in concept, so totality of a ship I would say probably 20-25%, sound about right?EKD: Yeah, and you know concept, to speak to concept, I think that's a place we want to spend a large amount of our time. Right, we get all of our designer questions answered, our gameplay groups questions answered, our art leaderships questions answered. It's the 'cheaper' portion essentially of the whole creation process.TD: That's a really valid point, it can be viewed in the same way as pre-production for the entirety of the game. That's where you get everything out of the way so everybody else can just execute without having to stop and go - \"what if the bike needs a bike chain...\"EKD: Yeah, yeah exactly. So, 20-25% I think that's good.TD: Then the design side, well design is kinda wrapped into that so let's call it 25-30% for concept, design, animation review, all that happens during that phase. The coding side, you know, in this case I would say the modeling for the ship and that would probably be about 70% of your time. That's the lion's share.EKD: And you want spend a lot, a lot there.

Very important part but definitely.TD: That is actually one thing in production that always tends to happen and something to keep aware of and combat if you ever want to be a producer is, VFX and audio are the oft forgotten but very important but last step in every process.EKD: Yes, going back to the predictability part of the last question, as things you hope won't push but as things might push different aspects there has to be an end date somewhere and so a lot of times that end date doesn't move and everything gets kinda crammed down and you can talk to our audio team and our effects team... they kinda plan on it which you don't want, you want them to have the ability to be as creative and make the coolest thing possible too. So, some of the ways we've kinda combated that is we get them involved as early as we can, like maybe back in concept, like just start thinking how this ship might sound or think about how this character...TD: Look at what the moving parts will be...EKD: Yeah exactly, for when it gets to animation, totally.", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 08 (2015.06.22)", "source": "https://youtu.be/m5eFAdJXXSE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Newt", "published_at_timestamp": 1435010541}, {"objectID": "27bb90f96378_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The Gemini is the only variant currently planned.", "published_at_timestamp": 1431640800, "question": "Will there be other variants of Starfarer in the future, or Gemini is the only known modification?", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/14716-Q-A-MISC-Starfarer-Part-III", "title": "Q&A: MISC Starfarer - Part III", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "67128eae8eae5_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The primary reduction in cargo capacity is because of internal armored bulkheads which can not be removed.

Will we see large, significant events like solar flares, Halley's Comet and solar eclipses triggering things like national holidays or large scale reactions among the populace and if so how will this be tied into the economy and culture of a system, planet or city?", "answer": "Yes, that is definitely something that we are planning on. From our standpoint, the big cosmic events are some of the elements that we use once the game is live as \"game masters\" that we'll use to create a living universe. So once the game is live we might create a cosmic event that leads to a famine on a planet, which in turn makes a huge demand for food to be shipped in, which will create player missions, or maybe there's a huge disaster somewhere that players need to respond to by running rescue missions before that world blows up in 2 months time or whatever it'll be. So we're planning on using cosmic events to stir things up in the galaxy, to make sure that things are kept dynamic and interesting. All these things will have an effect on the economy, as that's sort of the driving factor of the universe, what makes everyone get up in the morning. Imagine these events to be something like throwing a rock into a pool, the ripples spread to every facet of the PU.", "title": "10 For the Chairman: Episode 45 (2014.11.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/qXwybQaAbbs", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Sierra117", "published_at_timestamp": 1416257116}, {"objectID": "373678400", "question": "In the PU demo, I saw a cracked window of \"Dumper's Depot\". You mentioned that poorer planets might have graffiti and such, but will the planetside environment actively change when the overall prosperity of a planet fluctuates?", "answer": "Simple answer is yes! All buildings, vehicles, items and even characters are being built and structured so that they age. We have what we call secondary UV sets in the geometry that allow you to have another \"blend\" layer that comes in as ageing progresses. The ships we have now are set up with this already, so if you load the Hornet into an editor you can slide a bar (0-1) how much the blend layer comes in, either looking like a brand new ship or a beaten up, old weathered ship. So yes, we're building the assets with that, so it's already in the tech. The idea is we track the item as it goes through the universe with wear and tear, and while you might not be able to get your ship back to TOTALLY new, you'll be able to restore it to close with various treatments, and the same concept applies to the environment. The idea with those is the economy drives the looks of fixed buildings, so yes the more prosperous a place is the better upkept the buildings etc are. The states of these cities will be dependant on inputs from the persistent universe like economy, population etc, including the size of these cities. The whole idea is as time goes on, things grow or die, people change, and it's all based on real statistics from the PU. Should be pretty cool.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 42 (2014.10.20)", "source": "https://youtu.be/paE5gpEdltI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Jomanda", "published_at_timestamp": 1413842404}, {"objectID": "373678770", "question": "Are shields intended to function within an atmosphere? If so, do they create drag?", "answer": "I would say that shields generally would function inside an atmosphere, I don't know if they'd necessarily create drag. The idea with shields is they're much more for absorbing energy and not so much for preventing matter. It's the reason ballistic weapons have some their energy/velocity leeched from them but still penetrate, where energy weapons are absorbed until the shields go down. So armour is built for the ballistic weapons. So slower moving mass/objects it doesn't really stop, which I'd think means atmosphere passes through so no drag really.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 38 (2014.09.22)", "source": "https://youtu.be/hkZG9cNyuAY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Shalnan", "published_at_timestamp": 1411423420}, {"objectID": "373679210", "question": "Can you talk about how you will structure the single player elements of story in the game? Where are you drawing inspiration? What is your plan to balance individual achievements against accessibility for everyone?", "answer": "Hmm, so that's a pretty open-ended question because are we talking about single player elements of story in Squadron 42 (which is our sort of single player narrative that's very much like Wing Commander in terms of it's straight-ahead narrative, and then we'll drop you out in the Persistent Universe), or are you talking about single player elements that would exist potentially in the Persistent Universe where you come across someone and they say \"oh, I've heard about this legendary artifact off in 'so-and-so' but you'll have to fly over and talk to 'so-and-so' and he'll tell you a bit more about it\" ?So, in terms of the single player elements of Squadron 42, we're very much going with the Wing Commander narrative. Sort of almost like a war film... war picture setup. We've got a pretty cool story. I don't really want to share too much of it, because unlike Star Citizen in the Persistent Universe, part of the fun is sort of taking the journey. But it definitely will involve a mission that goes deep into Vanduul space, and things get weirder and weirder. So if I was gonna pitch it to you, I would say it would be... take the opening of Gladiator, mix it with the Ninth Legion, and Heart of Darkness Apocalypse Now... all set in space. I think it's gonna be pretty cool and you guys are going to quite like it.On the Persistent Universe side, we are going to have small story mission pieces of characters that you can meet. And we're sort of setting it up in the Persistent Universe where obviously there's going to be stuff that we base with other players and organizations, and general stuff that you can do, and then some of the story stuff will allow you to go and do missions that would feel more specific to you. So there are parts of the game where if you're off and you're doing a specific kind of mission, or you're going down a back alley to talk to someone in a sort of disreputable speakeasy, once you enter that speakeasy you're in your own private instance and the NPCs and everything there are all sort of there, so you're not going to have 30 other people all stream into your private conversation with someone that's going to give you a tidbit of information or a mission. So it's not going to feel like some theme park that there's all of these people streaming around you, which is one of the things I sort of hate with a traditional MMO. So we're mixing, in the Persistent Universe, areas where you'll interact with other players and talk to them where it makes sense, and then other areas where it'll be much more about your personal situation. So, you know, going down a dark alley, maybe you'll get some criminals that will try and mug you. Now that won't necessarily be players, but it will be some NPCs because you're on a shady out-world and basically that's where you go to do black market buying and selling, and therefore it's pretty dangerous, so take your sidearm pistol!So those are kinda the elements we want to do down in the Persistent Universe and the planets, to make them feel alive just like it feels alive in space. I think Tony Zurovec who's leading the Persistent Universe side has got some really great and fun stuff there. But we definitely want to make you feel like it's not generic templated missions in some places. Some stuff is obviously going to have to be templated, but some stuff will be specifically built and scripted for us, and we'll sort of have a nice combination. And that combined with what the players are also doing out there hopefully will create enough challenge and variation for people for quite a while.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 34 (2014.08.18)", "source": "https://youtu.be/y4wAP1fWe8c", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "FatSoDa", "published_at_timestamp": 1408399954}, {"objectID": "373683170", "question": "As spying and hacking will be part of the game I would like to know if for example a spy (with a blown cover) or a citizen who made a huge mistake will be able to get a new identity? I could imagine that this means he/she needs to visit an identity-renewal institution, new face, hair, etc?", "answer": "So yes, absolutely we're gonna allow it that there's actually a whole kind of setup where you can go and get plastic surgery and change your appearance. It's actually the device that we use at the beginning of Squadron 42 to be sort of in-fiction, but allow the player to determine what they look like. The concept is that you're involved in an opening battle and you kind of heroically save the day, but you're really badly scared and injured, so you wake up in hospital and you have to give input on how you want your face reconstructed. So we're definitely going to allow that; we'll definitely have parts where you'll be able to - you know, it'll be expensive - but there'll be places where you can do that, and there definitely will be some places where you could do that \"off the grid\" so to speak. So you can do it and not be tracked, so if you wanted to change your identity and do all the rest, in sort of the outlaw planets, you could do that, and it will definitely not be a cheap thing to do.
