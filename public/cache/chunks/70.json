Instead of charging for the jump point, Corath'thal's fleet diverted for Yar and Saisei, forcing the UEEN to break its formation and defend the populace leaving a small contingent of ships behind to protect the jump point. Captain Alexandra Dunlevy of the UEEN's 42nd Squadron, believing that this strategy would fail, convinced her commanding officer Admiral Tibault Fraser of the UEES <em>Countenance</em> to pretend to retreat under fire from the approaching Tevarin forces. As Corath'thal's fleet broke formation to enter the jump point, the 42nd Squadron ambushed them and took out their shields, giving the UEEN the opportunity to destroy a majority of the Tevarin ships.

What portions of FPS will need to be finalized and implemented for that update?", "answer": "Well nothing really: that's all in 2.2.So what we're doing, I think I've mentioned this quite a few times, is on the FPS side we have a whole bunch of features and weapons that we're just methodically going through and enabling. A lot of it is content related: so getting the animations polished before we feel like they are ready for everyone to see or use, and the same on the assets. And some of it is making some of the mechanics work or move a little better. So we've got things vaulting, like going vaulting over obstacles and stuff, that isn't going to be in 2.2 but it will be in 2.3 for instance.And so what we've been doing is knocking off the cover mechanic; things like prone or crouching; and various things in 2.2. We have physicalised EVA which is actually really cool, you get a real sense of inertia; you have to be a bit more wary in tight areas because we're actually properly simulating so it is like flying around a spaceship in a tight area: you don't really want to bang up against things because it will give you a bit of an impulse. But when you get it down I think it cooler and more exhilarating and we'll be adding more and more things that will make that cooler.So that's just our plan: we're continually adding more and more functionality to FPS. Our goal is the FPS is going to be very comparative to to other FPS's out there that have a whole bunch of cool detail and accuracy. So we're not really aiming to be a simplified 'run and gun' shooter we're actually aiming to be much more tactical and considered, and have that reflect in a lot of the FPS mechanics. So there will be a lot of options and things you can do, and stances, and actions, and ultimately it will have the ability to do parkour with sliding and vaulting over stuff and ledge grabbing and all of the rest of the stuff.So that's all on the roadmap. We've captured animations for all of it. We're slowly churning through the thousands of animations and hooking it up and making sure the animation blending works and all the various things you have to worry about to make it work well. But I'm pretty confident that when it's all said and done it will be actually pretty damn cool.", "published_at": "2016-02-29", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 77", "source": "https://youtu.be/DFkTG9YungQ", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "KuruptU4Fun1", "published_at_timestamp": 1456786477}, {"objectID": "373679670", "question": "On ship-persistence: will capital ships, like the Javelin, remain in space after all crewmembers logged off? Will it need protection or a NPC-crew to prevent the ship from damage or theft?", "answer": "So that's a pretty good question cause normally obviously you would land on a planet and then your ship just gets put in a hangar and everyone else can't really access that hangar. So in terms of ship position, persistence on the really big ones like the Javelin, we determined that there's going to be safe areas you can put it in orbit or dock, when it's in that safe area and you've logged off nothing can happen to it. It's not going to get blown up, or raided, or boarded while everybody's off and sleeping if you left your Javelin in an unsafe area then maybe potentially it's not, it depends how we're going to do it. At some levels we're going to take a little bit of liberty, like for instance we've said that ships that have beds; if you sleep in your bed, then that allows you to save the game.One of the things we're going to do so you could maybe sleep in your bed in an asteroid field and since there are no other players around, what we'll do is once you log off we'll take your ship, your ship will not be existing in an instance. So all the people flying around there, your ship wouldn't be there so they couldn't do anything to it and we'll also probably do something similar to that on the bigger ships as well. We don't really want you to come back to the game and go \"Oh where did my ship go?\" cause in real life you would still be sleeping on your ship.So I hope that answers it. We're going to basically protect it from people when they finished, logged off and it's not in use, as long as it's in certain areas that it's safe.

It's really important to kind of let you guys know that we are responding and we are looking at what you're feeling and how you're thinking about the stuff we're doing, and yeah, the stuff we are writing, the lore posts, they're intended to, as Will said, they're in-Universe, they're supposed to be taken as this is what exactly is happening right now, and these are kinds of the things that are going on, so hopefully by you guys reading those, you're getting hints to either the functionality of things in gameplay, or potential storylines in gameplay, so we try very hard to make sure those are going to be seeded into the Universe you guys are going to be experiencing.Will Weissbaum: Yeah, cause it's always been a goal of the game when it goes live is that you playing will be able to influence the world and make differences whether as an individual, or as a collective whole. So we've tried to start thinking about that now, through the lorebuilder posts, or we read your comments when we go on there, and seeing what you guys are feeling, and we love it when you roleplay in the comments, so much fun for us. And letting that influence it as kind of a precursor to how it's going to be in the game, where one of you is going to be the Murray Cup champion, or one will be the notorious pirate who assassinated the IMperator (Don't do that, that's bad), but that kind of stuff, and starting to build it now and, like Adam was saying, these stories we try to capture the feeling of what we hope the missions will be like, whether the civil war will still be raging when the game comes out, that remains to be seen, but stuff like that and seeing how, seeing which side you guys are going to take is very interesting from a lore perspective.", "published_at": "2015-10-05", "title": "10 for the Writers: Episode 05", "source": "https://youtu.be/u9ZZjMivl84", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Eschatos", "time": "10m35s", "published_at_timestamp": 1444081873}, {"objectID": "1e3c1d8097e876_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Dimensions of the Hangar.

Or do you do the concept and puff it up or shrink it to make it work?", "answer": "Forrest Stephan: So yeah, that is part of the reason that we do the follow-up concepts, and they do take some time, is because that's exactly what we do. We go through, we get all the dimensions, we make sure that the doorframes actually work with our FPS requirements, we make sure that the ship is fully functional when you're inside of it from a gameplay perspective, and in order for us to save time, we do a lot of block-outs in 3D, and making sure that it all works properly, which leads to some concept shots.However, there are some concepts that are just done by hand and roughed out very early on.Omar Aweidah: Totally. And I think in-house, like, the concept artists that work here and Foundry 42, they build everything in 3D cause they work closer with the game designers, so when you're concepting you're trying to save time for the modelers and everything like that, you definitely don't want a modeler to get something and go 'oh, this doesn't fit here'. So, we tend to have a little bit more time for concepts so that we can figure out everything and work closely with the design so that it doesn't have to be re-designed.But also, I mean, there is something to really cool 2D art that a lot of concept artists that are outsourced, just really make beautiful visual imagery. And then when we get those, we might take one of those drawings and then figure it out after the fact.FS: Yeah, we'll re-factor and make it work.OA: We'll make it work. I mean, we try our hardest... sometimes it can be confusing and difficult, but for the most part, we'll keep the essence of the ship as much as we can, which is usually the majority of it.

No, well, if there is any negative criticism, it's always important to figure out where the negative criticism is coming from. You want to make sure that the direction is correct, you want to make sure you're going the right route and making sure that what you're delivering is what's expected, cause sometimes you can create something good, but if it's not exactly what's needed, then you will get negative criticism, cause it's very specific things we need to deliver on. So I kind of re-evaluate the initial steps, which is defining the right references, making sure I understand the task properly, and then go into the direct source for the criticism, and figuring out how to improve to achieve what that person or group of people are actually looking for.OA: Like the direction.FS: Yeah, some direction. Or I just delete the email.OA: Everybody has an opinion right? And then there's how many peopleOA: Everybody has an opinion right? And then there's how many people commenting on any one thing, thousands of people have... 99% of people love it, there's still going to be 10 comments that, you'll see all 10 of them and they'll crush your soul, but generally most of the negative criticism comes from within the studio, and it's not necessarily negative criticism, it's more like, we have a critiquing process, which is what's working, what's not working, and that's with everything you do, and that's just part of the job. It doesn't effect me emotionally or make me like not sleep at night...FS: But honestly usually the hardest critiques are ourselves.OA: Absolutely.FS: The person making the art is usually the hardest critiquer, I find. Usually it's the other people that are telling him it's, what do I always say, how many artists does it take to screw in a lightbulb? It takes 10, one to screw it in, another 9 to tell him it looks okay, and it's bright enough.  That's just, you know... Even when it's done, I'm still critiquing it.OA: It's so hard to hear a bunch of artists be like, oh man, this looks so bad I can't believe I did this, I really screwed up this project, and then posted it, and then all the fans be like this is amazing, this is the greatest thing, and like, you like that?FS: and you look at it for so long though, sometimes you lose sight because you get caught up and you know all the issues, and you step back, and someone says that looks great, and you're like... what? I just...OA: There's that one wobbly line in the back that no-one ever noticed but you were zoomed in on that area...FS: No... no... you guys notice it.OA: Oh yeah, that's a whole 'nother beast. Star Citizen fans are... they just pin it, rip it apart...FS: They want it good.OA: That kind of caliber won't shoot that kind of bullet, and you're just like, augh, I'm just a concept artist I don't know man, but ah... it looks cool, right?

What you see today in Arena Commander is only a partial implementation of the radar system with the signatures, and also how the different missiles work. So we're gonna have heat-seeking, image recognition, friend-or-foe, and what we call sort of \"dumbfire\" which are basically kinda rockets. Different systems, different radar systems, different targeting systems for missiles will all have characteristics in terms of, like how big their firing cone would be, or the lock-on range, and how easy they are to shake or not to shake. So you're only just seeing a small amount of what the missile stuff will do. The basic system is actually there; we just haven't had time to flesh and finish it out because we're trying to get some of the other stuff working first. But the radar signature system is there and missiles all fix into that. We just haven't really delivered all the different kinds of missiles, because right now it's all heat-seeking. That's why you can launch flares, and if you launch chaff that doesn't make a difference, but chaff obviously would be much more important for, say an image recognition missile than a heat-seeking missile.So, I guess, yes.

Will the character become more resistant to g-forces much like a real pilot would over time? And to add to this will there be equipment such as a better g-suit to help you become more resistant to blacking out / redding out?", "answer": "Two questions there. I don't think the characters are going to become more resistant to g-forces over time, because we're not really going with the sense of stats or experience for a character, because when you're playing your avatar it's really you and it's really about your experience, and what you're doing. But having said that there will definitely be different equipment; g-suits, and that kind of stuff that you could buy or upgrade that would potentially increase your g-force limitation. So there's gonna be two levels - one which is the level you'll black out, and two, at a certain point there will be some stuff that ships can't handle because the space frame can't take that much force. So that would be an outer limit where, you know, the cliche version is you turn too fast and rip a wing off - that would be like a World War I example in an old biplane. But we're definitely gonna have some stuff, if you overloaded thrusters on a ship, and in a certain direction or whatever, it could potentially not be as strong as another direction and you could risk hurting your space frame. And then obviously you having a better g-suit could potentially allow you to ride the g's better than you could on the default.

It's a big weapons platform, it's strong, it takes a lot of damage.Comparatively to a 300i, the 300i is going to feel a little lighter, a little nimbler, maybe a little more maneuverable even, because it's not such a heavily armored weapons platform, but it can't take as much damage and can't dish out quite as much in its max stuff.So I think in some cases that will be just a personal play choice. We're gonna try and use Arena Commander to balance for the Persistent Universe. Obviously the Persistent Universe has a lot more issues, but the base balancing in terms of this weapon against that weapon and this ship against that ship will be kind of in Arena Commander.And don't forget, we handicap the ships, right, if you take out a Hornet with an Aurora, you're gonna get a lot more points than if you take out an Aurora with a Hornet basically. Think about it like golf, they handicap golf. So we're gonna try and use Arena Commander to help balance the PU or at least be the starting discussion for that.One last thing I'll say is, in Arena Commander, there are the loadouts for the base ships are a default dogfight loadout that we've got right now. Later in the process, v1.1 onwards, we're gonna allow you to customize your loadouts and put different weapons on, and I think that will be fun, it will be interesting to see what people use and then we can be tweaking the different weapons for different effects, and that's the whole point of having you guys do it, I think we'll get a really great sense of balancing and what's fun.", "published_at": "2014-06-02", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 23.
