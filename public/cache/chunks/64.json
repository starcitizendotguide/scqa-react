So small items that don\u2019t mean much like bullet shells or whatever would  just be discarded if you left the area, but certain items, especially items that you would own like a spaceship or something will persist and stay around and that\u2019s what we call the entity owner manager.<br /><br />So there\u2019s basically a manager that would manage what\u2019s in your ship, like in the cargo hold or what you\u2019re owning or what\u2019s inside the space station or what\u2019s on an area in a planet and then that\u2019s what responsible for managing the persistence of these items and whether they stay or not and then also is serial and then the items themselves are saving off their stay and so what that means is for something like Port Olisar if we wanted to allow you to break or destroy common areas which is another discussion because you know, we don\u2019t want someone blowing out a window in an area where everyone else is and killing all the people hanging out in the space station.<br /><br />So there will definitely be some areas where we will not allow you to have player generated mayhem, but there certainly could be the cases. You know you already see in the Comm-Satellite missions where you\u2019re asked to go and turn them back on or not, well we\u2019re definitely going to have stuff where there\u2019ll be a space station or a satellite relay that's been damaged or broken by an AI or maybe even by a player and that will automatically generate a mission inside our system to say, \u201cHey come and repair me\u201d and players or AI could respond to it and they would go there and repair it and then its persistence state would go from damaged to functional again.<br /><br />TZ: That\u2019s how<br /><br />CR: If it\u2019s broken then the cycle starts again.<br /><br />TZ: That\u2019s how I read the question which is basically we\u2019ll have two different tiers of repairs I would say and one of them is significant enough as such that it warrants the creation of missions and this would be damaged satellites and things of that sort and if a player doesn\u2019t do it then a NPC will. Then there\u2019s also just the more stuff, I would say it\u2019s more cosmetic. Windows getting shot out in Area 18 and there\u2019s always going to be players there and so it won\u2019t be so much an issue of well when the players all go away then we can just go ahead and reset things. That will be handled more by just the NPC community. There will be NPCs that actually do savage, not salvage, that basically do maintenance. Maintaining of a given area and when you break glass, when you basically shoot barrels of trash and garbage gets scattered about, some of the NPCs would have the responsibility of fixing that up, cleaning things up, etc.<br /><br />CR: Cleaning up after the players.<br /><br />TZ: which makes for that much more an interesting world because not only can you break things in interesting fashion, you can actually see the NPC community put it back to together.<br /><br />CR: You\u2019re going off to prison because you\u2019re a vandal.

We can start to talk about that. just to start on a few of the comments about the Xi'an Scout which i'm currently implementing for the hangar ready, in the hangar.The actual name of the vehicle is the Aopoa Khartu Al. It is the manufacturer Aopoa's conversion of the Xi'an scout for human use. It currently has a single seat and no ejection capabilities. I just want to put that out there. We decided that for a light fighter of this size the current single seat arrangement worked best for it. In the future we may have a variant of perhaps another Aopoa  manufactured seat that has multiple seats but the current iteration of the Khartu Al is single seater.The thruster questions on here. Yes, the Khartu Al will have four articulated thrusters. The thrusters themselves will orient themselves to actually be able to complete a turn a turn up to ninety degrees for the outer most axes. Each of the thrusters themselves will include the retro thrusters in the front so they'll be dual sided thrusters which will greatly allow the Khartu Al to have a lot of maneuverability so that the main thrusters can actually contribute to horizontal and vertical thrust as well.Darian Vorlick: Basically it's vectored thrusting.KT: Right. The way we're going to do this, we're going to allow the main thrusters to contribute to sideways thrust without actually animating them as quickly as they need to provide that thrust. One issue what we had with the Cutlass, that we still currently have with the Cutlass. Is that having the large thrusters provide thrust in the actual vector that are facing makes the thrusters so that they're really floppy and so from the rear, when the Cutlass is flying should we provide any type of vertical thrust to provide stability for the ship.We found that, they're simply too floppy and it just looks awful. So the way to do this is to provide that thrust and actually throttle the, speed at which they rotate so that will have a ship that has this type of nice, floaty motion without having four long wings that simply flap in the wind which will make it look awful. So we're still developing that and we will of course have that available for the engine and for future ships so that, that will become available. In the near time, we're considering making the Cutlass thrusters only rotate for VTOL.The same is maybe true of the Freelancer that way they still will have joint rotation without that weird floppy animation. Some other technology we will need to develop, the Khartu Al is one of the first ships that will have a landing and flying mode, which are vastly different. you'll notice it is very folded up when it's landed and will expand out like a flower when it's in flight mode. The same will be true for the Reliant.So what we'll do is, we'll create states for the ship; landed or in freeflight that way the thrusters know how they're going to behave and will allow things like; turning them off when it's in landed mode or for the Reliant because of the vertical orientation of them. We will know how these thrusters are supposed to affect the ship because of those two states that the ship is in.DV: Yeah, how does something like... we have our Flight Engineer: John Pritchett, who works on the ICFS and SCM how would does this change what he needs to do as far as flight controls are concerned.KT: That's a great question! We would need to discuss with him how we would need to signal the ship, so that it knows which orientation its in. I think that's a simple variable in the ship will determine when it's not in landed mode or when it's in flight mode and then John can then, recalculate what the actual thrust from each of the thrusters, needs to generate in order to maintain proper flight based on that orientation of the ship.DV: That is a mouthful!KT: It's a complicated ship!", "published_at": "2016-02-22", "published_at_timestamp": 1456181823, "question": "Since you are working on the Xi'an Scout, which from its initial concept had a set of movable thrusters, can you update us on the technology development to support this, as well as any effect it might have on other ships with rotating or otherwise articulating main thrusters?

There already is a lore series called \"Discovered\", which you can find a handful already on the RSI website, that are stories of famous expeditions, famous explorers that have discovered jump points or new worlds: different things like that.

I definitely have a list of moments in history that we can go back to and maybe delve into further. And as Will said it just a matter of time management at this point and being able to allocate our resources to the best possible places. But it is definitely something on our mind and you can expect plenty of logs out there explaining some ...WW: We've floated the idea too about making some of the more important historical moments playable as well with some kind of special mission packs or something like that.

How will you prevent this?", "answer": "Well, we're going to like everyone that try to build big online games, we're going to try our best to prevent that. I wouldn't say that we're like any more....we're smarter or more of a rocket scientist than some of the other people doing online games. I will say that I think gold selling happens but one of the reasons, for instance, why it happens in let's say like World of Warcraft....you can't get the gold from Blizzard, or at least when I used to play you couldn't. In our particular game, our sort of plan to bring revenue in that will pay for the servers, and will pay for the customer support staff, and will pay for us to build additional features and content is to either sell the base game to people joining the game. They just come in, they buy their game, their ship and now they've joined Star Citizen or you know people who don't have a lot of time but they really want that shiny, brand new weapon or that shiny new ship. So, they're like, 'you know I'm just going to buy some UEC this month or this week so I can go and buy that thing I want instead of going out there and flying ten missions to earn the money inside the game. So, we are essentially, with caps, we're going to be selling the equivalent of gold so when you can buy it through the source that's a big difference than getting it from somewhere else. Then on top of that we're going to have just like you would have in the real world some level of control over like player's transferring money to each other and stuff like that. You'll never be able to stop someone from selling their stray account but you won't be able to just go, 'oh here, I'm wiring a million UEC to someone'. You can't do that in the real world here, if I send too much money to a friend of mine it's deemed as income to that person and they'll have to report it as taxes. So, there will be some level of control in the same way as the real world to prevent people from sort of doing that kind of thing. We'll probably have some sort of limit on the amount of cash transfers between players but it's super early days to figure that out right now. So, there's a bunch of ideas in how to try and make it fun and fair and balanced but it's super early. I'm sure what I just said may have gotten a bunch of people up in arms but I wouldn't start getting concerned just yet cause we're going to try and have something we think works for everyone, that makes it as fair as possible to try and get rid of the gold selling. Bots, again that just something that you're concerned about, we're using a policy of semi trusted client but checking on the server side that we'll be looking out for people who will be trying to 'game' the system. I think the other thing to remember is that it's not kind of the same competitive set up as you've got in let's say World of Warcraft where everyone wants to race to the top level so they can hit the end game. I think there will be a lot of things for people to do and they can fight and play against NPCs or against other players, it'll be up to them to choose their own play style. I'm just hoping the open world nature of it will allow a lot of people to have fun but like I said we're not necessarily smarter or better at this than anyone else. I'm sure we'll have to combat this and we'll try our best to make sure that it doesn't ruin the game experience for the rest of the community.

You have essentially a live game that you are supporting while you are creating a game at the same time. A lot of companies have done this by separating the development teams and having a live team versus the people who are creating it...DV: You are doing production and preproduction at the same time.EKD: Exactly exactly.  Not necessarily the case for us.  I don't know if it hinders because there are a lot of things that mesh well.  We benefit a lot from things that have come up during the live build that we can then put into what we are trying to develop at the same time and vice versa. And because we are working on it at the same time we are more agile with moving that stuff around. Maybe a little bit of both but I definitely think it definitely helps a little bit more to have that live feedback and to get people playing it and when people play our game it gets us excited. It makes us want to make more.DV: It also doesn't help that we are kind of spearheading this. This is a brand new kind of project and we are paving the way.

I don't know if football is still a sport in our universe or not - I'd have to check with Haddock on that. But the plan at least initially has always been for, I think it was the base 105 star systems, each with an average of 4 landing locations, which would vary in scale and size from a large sprawling city to something that's more of a remote outpost. So I do think there are going to be, if nothing else, plenty of places to go and land, and explore, and walk around. Now to answer you question about-... like, I guess specifically you're talking about the ArcCorp demo... So first of all, that was a demo - that was the first area of ArcCorp. There are other planned areas that I think you guys have even seen concepts for, for different parts of ArcCorp. Another good example is Terra - so Terra for example has the large central city, and is kind of the upper-crust Abu Dhabi feel, Rio de Janeiro feel, a very high end technology. There are also other parts to Terra though, that are more like the favelas, say, in Rio de Janerio - where everybody who works in the city lives. So there's areas called \"the blocks\", and so you'd be able to take the monorail to traverse to different environments within that same landing location. The idea being that if we have these kind of sequestered areas you can introduce, say, one area during patch, and in the following patch we may unlock another part of ArcCorp, another part of Terra, and we can just additively... add to the content that's in the game.Darian Vorlick: There isn't really a square-footage... or I guess, square... astronomical unit. It's constantly going to be growing, so there's always going to be new content to explore. At what rate we release this at, again we do have timelines for these development channels, so as more things come up the universe is going to get bigger, and bigger, and bigger. So I don't think there will be any shortage of things to explore and places to visit, and all kinds of new mysteries to unravel, because we do want exploration to be a part of the game.

The plan is certain sizes of ships will be able to pull up next to each other with the docking bays, and even if they don't have fitting docking bays, or they're not set up to do that then you should be able to leave your ship and EVA over to the other one, enter an airlock, and be inside the other one. So you definitely will be able to transfer between ships in flight.", "published_at": "2014-10-13", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 41 (2014.10.13)", "source": "https://youtu.be/4GflyTrFtTo", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Jasper", "published_at_timestamp": 1413243710}, {"objectID": "373679250", "question": "Concerning exploration gameplay, what gameplay elements / mechanics can players expect from an explorers lifestyle? Besides scanning for jump points, asteroid fields, anomalies and derelicts, what other activities can an explorer do?", "answer": "Well, we know that exploring is a big deal for people, so jump points obviously, asteroid fields, anomalies, derelicts - they're all sort of things that you would try and find. I mean, we're certainly going to let you... even a known star system has most of the space uncharted, so as an explorer you could fly around to try and find, you know - whether it's the asteroid field, or the anomaly, or the derelicts - and then chart it. And once you've charted areas you can either share it with your organization / friends, or you could sell it back to the game to create some charted maps for that area that people can pre-buy. We are going to definitely have things like alien artifacts or some ruins on planets, so you can go down and discover it. So we'll have, definitely kind of scavenger hunt style stuff, and something where you maybe have a very short... kind of like \"okay, I find an artifact - I've gotta get two other pieces of this artifact, and that will give me a key that will open up this other thing, that will allow me to get this rare item that would be really valuable.\" So there's a fair amount of that sort of stuff. On exploration we're sort of thinking of having some areas where you can land on a planet and sort of explore around to look for stuff, go down in some ruins or whatever... but have something that feels like it has a lot more substance than, for instance the Mass Effect when you had the little rover going on the outside of the planet. Of course that would be sort of limited to areas that we'd let you land in, and some of that would be pseudo-procedurally generated - not everything will be fully hand crafted in those cases.But yeah, basically those are kind of the exploration stuff. So you, going and charting open space for the different areas of interest, going through jump points and then charting out that system and maybe landing on some planets that people haven't spent much time on, going down to somewhere with an archaeological dig, whether it's down on a planet or on an asteroid field. Those are all sort of things that we're thinking would be really fun for people that like to explore. So hopefully you will too!", "published_at": "2014-08-11", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 33 (2014.08.11)", "source": "https://youtu.be/XBVkhXGX8iI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Uchuu", "published_at_timestamp": 1407796258}, {"objectID": "373684920", "question": "Will we get hangars for our orgs and will members be able to leave their ships there?Maybe while flying an org owned ship?", "answer": "Yes, we do have plans to have organization hangars which are much bigger.They'll be shared and communal, we're gonna allow organizations to also be able to buy ships. I think I've said before organizations will be able to tithe a tax, demand fees, from their members, and they should be able to lend them out to various members to use. I would guess you would probably let players leave their ship there, especially if they're taking off in and organization owned ship.So yes, the answer would be yes there.", "published_at": "2014-04-07", "title": "10 for the Chairman - Episode 15 .

NPCs definitely can fly on their own. I think the question probably relates to if you have some NPCs flying, working for you, what they do. If you're online, they're flying on your wing or manning your ship, then yes, they're definitely doing your stuff and doing their functionality. If you have logged-off, no the NPCs that are working for you aren't off there running a business for you.
