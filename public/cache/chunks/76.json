So, I'm kind of interested in seeing people use that as going and doing non-combat oriented stuff but of course, then they'll be taking the material somewhere to sell, then you can either hand it off or take them yourself. Maybe there will be pirates after you trying to jack you for the ore that you've got and then maybe you can have someone help and protect you. I think there's a lot of cool immersion gameplay that'll come from that. So, that's the answer on that one.", "published_at": "2016-04-25", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 84", "source": "https://youtu.be/MMlaecTbKjo", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Smoke Stak", "published_at_timestamp": 1461622118}, {"objectID": "373674770", "question": "Do you ever find yourself being challenged with a 'dream big' mentality vs a 'be realistic' mentality?

So, we have obviously a huge list of what we want Star Citizen to be and what we try and do is really work on the different stages of getting us to the stars as it were. So, we spend a lot of time and if you guys saw the size of our design of what we have and all the different levels we have which are just well beyond stuff we even do this year and so forth, and a lot of stretch goals.We've got massive places we're going to take it and right now we're really focusing on the fundamentals of getting, especially the Persistent Universe, getting the Stanton system in place, getting the core sort of features such as persistence so you basically can earn money, you can trade, you can do mining and so forth. Those are the first things we're focusing on, also some of the smaller things around that, like what's it mean if you do a cargo run, how do you have abilities apparent to intercept cargo, how does that work.If you're cargo running and you get dropped out of quantum drive, how can you call for help in the middle of nowhere and so forth. So all these things are the sort of things we answer as we go along, stuff we have designs for but they're things we're focusing on now to drop in there so players can really get into this system which the Stanton system is going to be a bigger play environment with more going on then pretty much any game there already. Then we're going to be dropping in the other systems along with that as well. Yes, it's always a big task to work out, this is what we want to do and focus it down to what are the next steps. That's actually what I've been spending a lot of time this week in meetings, just working out what are our next steps for the latter half of this year on the Persistent Universe.", "published_at": "2016-03-28", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 80", "source": "https://youtu.be/zvm1jW_Xp_8", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Belzoth", "published_at_timestamp": 1459202407}, {"objectID": "373675210", "question": "Are there any short term plans on integrating our hangar and planet side module with the mini-PU (Universe/Crusader) module?", "answer": "Absolutely so that is the goal! So the goal is really that Crusader which we're call the mini PU and that really is the little baby PU and it's going to be growing up in front of your very eyes and we'll be adding to it. So we're just going  to be folding in everything to that. Which will be the hangar, which will be the landing areas.So as soon as we have the planetary transition; the procedural planet stuff that we've shown, in a state that we're sharing with everyone out there, which isn't going to be that far away, it'll be sooner than you guys think then you won't have any of this loading in separately to ArcCorp. So you'll just go to the planet, and then you'll fly down, and get landing permission, and land in the landing area, get out and move around, interact with people, buy things, and get missions, and get back in your ship and fly back.So that is the goal and that is what we're trying to do. So the process is like you've already seen, well you haven't necessarily but in the PTU people have seen that we've rescaled Crusader and this is true on 2.2 but essentially that's going to start changing and that will be Stanton system over the next few releases that we're doing. So we'll build out ot be Stanton and then we'll be going between the different areas and planets on Stanton, the space stations, and then ultimately when all that's working and we've got various missions and a lot of the echo system working and we open up and have jump points and then we'll move into some other systems.So that's the process, you're going to see the Star Citizen Persistent Universe grow in front of your eyes and I think the actual level of fidelity and detail which you can see as you move around even in a very compressed area like Crusader without that many things to do. So just means even though we don't have hundreds or billions of star systems there's still lots to do and lots of detail and lots of texture and that's kind of our focus is to make this feel like an incredibly, cool and alive and emergent world, that you can play a trader in some ways people can make a whole living, a whole life staying inside one star system.So there you are, that's the plans on that.", "published_at": "2016-02-29", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 77", "source": "https://youtu.be/DFkTG9YungQ", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "HyperToxic", "published_at_timestamp": 1456786477}, {"objectID": "373682500", "answer": "Steve Bender: I think overall the concept behind Star Citizen as a first person combat game is to give you freedom.

For example, if the turret is targeting the same vessel as the pilot, then trying to keep the crosshairs on the target from the turret is extremely difficult. Being able to switch to a ship relative targeting mode would allow the turret personnel to make the choice dependent on whether they are targeting the same target, or a different target.", "answer": "So we do have two modes. There's the relative mode targeting mode in the turret when you're flying it which basically has the turret keep its orientation irrelevant of which way the pilot's flying. Of course it can't always keep its orientation based on the limits of the turret. And then there's the normal one where you are basically rotating or pitching your turret relative to the ship itself. So if the pilot turns around 180 degrees your turret will have essentially moved round 180 degrees.I can't remember if it is Ctrl+C or Alt+C that switches between the relative and nonrelative mode in the turret, and there probably was a point where it was broken. I've seen stuff recently actually on forums where people were like \"oh, you can go to relative mode and here's the thing\" so I think that indicates it may be back up and working.I know turrets for us is actually one thing we're working to improve so a) that mode needs to be better and will be better; b) turrets need to be more responsive. We've been working it, I think you'll see some stuff in 2.2 that will improve it a bit and then we'll go forward with that: better UI; having the targets tracking a lot more information for your HUD; faster responding turrets; more natural ... if you are using the mouse you're not dragging it all the time. So all those are things we acknowledge because we actually want to make the turreting, the experience like manning a turret, to be fun and you are pretty effective at shooting people down so you can be effective as a ... because multi-crew ships are going to be much more about things like the turrets or their missile loads because they won't have the maneuverability necessary to get on someone's tail. You need to counter that otherwise so you've got stronger shields, stronger armour; you've got turrets that can point in different directions; you've got heavy missile payloads that can do damage.So all those are the things we are working on to make better and it's been an iterative process because there's so much stuff to do that everyone sometimes feels fairly overwhelmed. But don't worry we'll get there and that will be ... one of the hallmarks is meant to be the multi-crew experience where you are on a ship; you and your friends flying it; people are running into the turrets; jumping into a snub nose fighter; running around putting out fires; replacing blown fuses: all working together as a team to operate efficiently in combat. And I think that again will be one of the things that will set Star Citizen apart because that will be done and simulated in a fidelity you don't normally see, and it should be really rewarding to work together as a team to beat off these attackers or take another ship out.", "published_at": "2016-02-01", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 76", "source": "https://youtu.be/GOyEcb5jJfE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Blade of Akire", "published_at_timestamp": 1454367842}, {"objectID": "7844df1f555_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "It's going to have some flexibility with loadouts, but even inside its own variants, there's going to be limits to what you can setup.

And you'd just have it attached to elements of your ship or any entity or item, which can read variables to trigger items etc. The whole point of it is to have things like the interaction in the retaliator in your hangars right now, the doors opening and closing for you is all driven by an early version of GOST as you go in an out etc. But that same logic can also say, \"this door is locked\" and to show a red light, but if you put a keycard into this slot, that might say to unlock that and 10 other doors on the ship.
