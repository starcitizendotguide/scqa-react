The game has a lot of fans but also a lot of detractors, and for every missed deadline those detractors' claims are proved more correct. What would you say to reassure them?", "answer": "Chris Roberts: I mean, you're a gaming journalist, I've been in the industry a long time. How many times do you hear that another publisher like EA or Ubisoft or anyone that's creating something big or new or ambitious, even after four or five years of development, where they've promised it for this year and then when the time comes they say 'actually, it's going to be the following year after all'. It happens a lot. A lot of titles get killed along the way. The game business is unpredictable - there's a lot of R&D which happens, people are just not particularly aware of that because they don't see how the sausage is made a lot of the time.<br /><br /><i>Sure, although the difference for you guys is that people have already put in their money, as opposed to a Ubisoft game which isn't crowdfunded.</i><br /><br/>Chris Roberts: Yes, but we do say it when people put in their money - there's a load of disclaimers on it. The beginning of our schedule page if you go to it is a load of caveats - quality is always the number one priority, so if we need to redo something versus staying on schedule we will redo it. That R&D is quite unpredictable and even if we've scheduled something out we may have missed some things. That when you're in bug-fixing phase, you could fix it in a week, you could fix it in an hour, you don't know. So we have all these caveats to our schedule, we say it has been built very traditionally by people who have been in the industry for a long time. Our production group is over 30 people, who have worked on everything from Grand Theft Auto to World of Warcraft, Halo, Destiny. They are not amateurs. It's stuff I've done for a long time, but the project is just so large, there's so much R&D, so many interdependencies, that as you get into things there are aspects which have a ripple effect on the schedule. It may be taking longer than we want, longer than we thought it was going to take, but our goal is to communicate at least where it's at all the time. And our schedules legitimately are internal schedules, the ones we share with the community. Now we're in the bug-fixing phase of 3.0 we've shared out bug count and you can see our fix rate against the discovery rate of new bugs.<br /><br />People still say 'Chris, you lied to me', even if I did give all those caveats for our predictions. People forget all those qualifiers. I am fed up of giving someone an estimate - I'd rather say, here's the data I have, here's the schedule I see. This is what we are hoping for. Software developers at all levels tend to be optimistic - you have to be to build big things. But I hope that with what we're doing, show what we're doing every week, we can educate a fair amount of people about the process. There will always be cynics. And we're big - I grew up in Manchester when United weren't great, Liverpool were the team of the time. Now people hate United because they're the big team of the 90s and 2000s. There are people who love to show up in the match report in the Guardian and rile up their rival supporters. There's definitely an element of that which happens in Star Citizen - there's an element of investment and passion in the community, and when you're invested in something it's easy to get rises out of those people. There's a subset of people who say 'this thing is never going to come out, it's a scam'. Which is plainly not true. It would be the worst scam in the world. We're hiring all these people, we're working really hard. We're showing what we're doing every week.<br /><br />You could say 'I wanted it to be this big [small gesture] instead of this big [large gesture]. That would be a legitimate complaint. But some of the stuff is literally just like a fan trolling a match report for their rival team. It happens. I see it on Call of Duty versus Battlefield, or PlayStation versus Xbox. There's an element of gaming culture which plays into that. The majority of our gamers, by our metrics, are happy. They don't really care, or pay attention to it, or read the comments. We know on our stuff, we know the people who are joining us and playing the game. We know how many people of those then are active in our community, who go to our forums. Then there are the people who are really loud to get their opinion across. And they are a fraction of a fraction of a fraction [of our playerbase]. It's a long term challenge for, in general, the world - there's a lot of loudness which gets over-amplified through social media. Maybe five per cent of people cared about that issue but it gets blown up.

You don't have to go back and fix things that you've broken. That's a successful ship to me.Elwin Bachiller: Right, I mean I can agree with that, to some degree.

How do you all prevent \"status updates\" from interfering with personnel doing their jobs? Most of the status content we're seeing looks like it takes a while to put together and that it would really get in the way of actually creating the universe. As such when I stop seeing something like Around the Verse's \"Ship Shape\" during a given week or several weeks straight I'm assuming the personnel are refocusing on actually getting the ships out. Accurate or are those folks on vacation?", "answer": "Jason Hutchins: Your assumption is correct: they all go on holiday until the camera rolls really!Jake Ross: [chuckles]JH: No, they don't. They do, in fact, get back to work on their respective pipelines. It certainly can be a big distraction. Not that we don't love spending a lot of time with Thomas here, or writing letters for the community. It's an important thing though. So the community updates that we do, they're written as a partnership between the senior production staff, the developer leads that they work with closely, and the Community team.The senior producers are in a position to have a big picture view of the project. Which makes them uniquely suited to write this kind of report. One mantra of Production is \"protect your team\" and that's protect your team from distractions; protect your team from things that keep them doing their job. So a good producer will take this to heart and keep the impact of these kind of reports to a minimum. Try to keep it to no more than a few minutes per developer per week on these kind of reports.It's the collating of the report, and the gathering of the necessary materials, the writing it down and editing it that really takes the time. I've personally spent: the worst was probably a day and a half total, spread out over a few days, writing some of the bigger Star Marine reports that I was working on. But I would say that the average time for me has worked out at less than four hours a week. That's a chunk of time but if I worked a forty hour week, which would be awesome, it's less than ten percent of my time. So I would say the average time is not that great.JR: And it's important for a producer to know what his or her team is working on at any given point. So we have weekly scrums here, we have leads meetings, we have just the day-to-day interaction with developers. At any point I know what my team is working on at any given time. So making these reports, I know you do the Star Marine reports, and I'll chip in on the monthly report you guys see; but with any of these reports it's easy for the producer to take that information from his head and put it on paper because he already just knows what his team is working on. In some instances it's not the case and you actually have to reach out and get detailed updates for things you don't have the information on. But for the most part you should be able to pull a lot of that information from your head already. So the important thing is, like you said, to protect your team from that time and a good way to do that is just to pull it from your own head.JH: I should point out we're not doing the Star Marine reports any more. Our focus has shifted so that it's specifically a report on the progress of 2.0 and ultimately that will be a report on our Star Citizen releases in general. I've been partnering with Tom Johnson in Manchester on those reports now, so we're splitting the burden which makes it both easier and harder for both of us.The other thing I wanted to point out is that developers like Zane Bien working on the User Interface or Mark Abent who does the Bugsmasher, those guys obviously spend more time but I think those are important updates. The communication with our backers, with you guys, and getting that feedback from the community really keeps the team going and allows us to make course corrections where we need to.

Are we seeing the bleeding edge, or is it mostly polished but old content to you? What is the project management style, meaning waterfall, some flavor of agile or something else?

Very rarely, do we ever need to cajole or coerce them into doing something.  I think it's because they know I have a sword hanging on my desk that I don't need to do that to begin with.  (They both laugh).  But it is an interesting question because a lot of the stuff we work on is planned out months in advance, however, a lot of stuff during, let's say stuff we are working on towards Citizen Con, we're still plugging away at things even until the 11th hour.So there may be features we've been trying to fix, trying to get into the game.  We may not see it until like a day or two before.  Or we may only see one aspect of that project, and we won't see the completed or finalized thing until we are at the event.  Because we are only working on one facet of it, so being able to see it in completion, the complete fruition of all our works, we see it on the live stream when all you guys see it.EKD: Yep.DV: I guess like when you have an actor working on a film, they only do their lines.  They don't see the final film until like a private screening or something.  So this is very similar, we won't see the final product until either just days in advance, or during the live stream, and that's why when you see us watching the live streams, we are cheering along with you guys because this is awesome, we get to see what we've been working on for the last two or three months.EKD: Yeah, we keep our heads down, and it's hard to see the whole thing all the time with how big we are.  It is a bit of both.  We do have a master schedule that is laid out, and we are constantly feeding into that.  The stuff we are showing you, because of the environment we are in, we're showing you the stuff as much as we can as often as we can.  So unless it's a big reveal that we want to show off to you guys, like we did at (DV: Bishop's speech) Citizen Con, Bishop's speech, we might hold that a little tighter because we want to make it cool to get you excited, but for the most part we are trying to show you guys everything we possibly have all the time.But we do have a longer term schedule that we are feeding into, and we're delivering as much as we possibly can as often as we can that feed into that.  Because everything you are seeing is still building that large universe, right, and that's why Chris built this out kind of at the beginning as modules, so we can show you here are the pieces that make it and here's exactly what we are doing.DV: Even on Around the Verse, the Art Sneak Peek and stuff like that, so they may see that piece of art or concept artwork, so knowing those kinds of concepts are being previewed, we're still working on facets of that concept or that ship, that terrain, whatever we are previewing, so that by the time it is released to the Hangar or into Arena Commander, or whatever we work on in the Persistent Universe, that is the culmination of months worth of work, but you've been kind of seeing the progress all along, because we do like to share that transparency with everyone.EKD: Yep.  Exactly.DV: As far as project management methodologies.EKD: Yeah, we get this question a lot.DV: It's pretty agile I guess?EKD: It is pretty agile, what's not hardcore 100 percent.DV: RightEKD: We follow more agile, but we take a lot from waterfall, right, because we do have this large thing we are trying to deliver, and all these milestones for each of those.  They are kinda living within each other, because agile is more this micro deliveries within these larger milestones.DV: I'm going to use my brother's methodology, it's called the DWIT system.  Do whatever it takes.EKD: There you go.  Get er' done!DV: DWIT system.  Do whatever it takes.  Now, as far as Mad Max or Jurassic Park, I'm going to photoshop a picture of Eric on Chris Pratt's face from Jurassic World, and different designers faces on the velociraptors when he's standing in the pit kind of like this.EKD: That's a tough question, because it's, I don't know if you've heard, it's like herding cats, right, you have people who are very passionate and know what they have to get done, but keeping them all together is a challenge, but a good challenge.

The question is do we want to. Do I see a need for something to travel faster than 500 m/s in normal space-flight travel? One of the ideas that's been floating around is for every ship to be limited to a speed with a realistic explanation, is that each ship is designed to perform within an envelope up to that 500 m/s. Everything in that envelope is governed by accelleration. So maybe it's 300 m/s. You might be able to reach that in, say, 10s. Then when you push out beyond that, you can really only move in a straight line (mostly) because your thrusters are so weak they can't do much to change your velocity, and your ability to accelerate up to that 500m/s falls off dramatically after you reach the edge of your envelope.

And if so, since we know there are at least two gravity factors: zero-g and Earth-like, is it presumable that there will be two types of ballistic curves for each load/shell/round?", "answer": "The projectile modelling in the game is full physical modelling, so we're actually in the process of changing out some abstracted damage point models for the projectiles to make it be more about velocity, mass, energy, size/volume/cross-section of a projectile. It's going to be much less about \"this shell does 10 points of damage and this shell does 20 point s of damage\". It's going to be much more, a hit at this velocity, it weighs this much, its cross-section is this much &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; and that will translate into amount of kinetic energy that's imparted that will translate into a damage amount. Energy bolts will be more about energy and less about the kinetic energy transfer... but still about the energy that is poured into the laser bolt. Because of that, you could have multiple weapons that fire the same projectile &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; say a 25 mm shell or a 50 mm shell &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; and it can have the same mass and everything but since the weapons fire the same projectile at different velocities, then that projectile will do different amounts of damage upon striking on whatever target you're shooting at.Then, not only that but things like the gravity &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; whether it's zero-g, Earth-like, or some other gravity &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; is all part of the simulation. So, as we move it forward at the speed, it will be affected by other forces which could include wind and all of the rest of the stuff. So all of that is modelled in CryPhysics and because we're having our projectiles all part of the physical simulation, all of the forces that affect everything else will also affect projectiles. This is slightly different from the way Crysis and those games have done it because they just did a ray cast and said, \"Did I hit or not hit?\", but we're actually firing real projectiles and moving them around in the physical space so they have all of the forces that act on them.So, yes, essentially you would probably have a slightly different trajectory path for a bullet you fire in zero-g as opposed to a bullet you fire in a more Earth-like gravity. Although, they go fast enough over a short enough distance that in most cases it would not be discernible.

How will this affect being able to receive updates from CryTek to the engine, or will the changes be pushed back to CryTek?", "answer": "Darian Vorlick: So this is where the skills of a producer come in. If we don't know the answer, we go and find it. So we actually sought the answers from a few of our Crytek guys - Sean Tracey, Paul Reindell, and James Wright. I've got that answer for you guys here, so forgive me for reading from it, but I think you guys'll find it pretty informative.So Sean actually wanted to say, he actually thought it was a really good question, and an astute observation that changing many of the base implementations of data types like \"Quad T\", Matrix 4434, and even double precision integers, make integration significantly harder and time consuming, no doubt. So in some cases it can actually be automated which can help mitigate it, but the toughest times will be when and if Crytek introduces a new feature that specifically uses data types, and we have to update that feature completely. Sean also goes on, and James goes on, to say that our 64-bit change is actually a very targeted change of all world space positions and transforms. It is not a blanket and blatant 64-bit change, so while it does raise the difficulty of taking integration from Crytek, it is not impossible. In fact before we complete our first integration from our large-world branch to our main branch, every integration the large-world team took was like taking an integration from Crytek in many ways. So we have had a lot of practice at this point.So on the Crytek front, it's basically quite far away from the base engine at this point and once the 64-bit switch is done it will be even further. But this is not uncommon with games that start with an engine license as middleware. The point of most of this middleware is that you will end up customizing to your games needs, and let's just say that the technical needs for Star Citizen are beyond those of any game that's been done using this engine.Travis Day: So that information comes from Paul Reindell, who's our lead engine programmer, Sean Tracey who's our CryEngine tech director, and also from James Wright who is also the guy who's actually heading up the 64-bit conversion for a lot of the world space transforms.", "published_at": "2014-12-29", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 02 (2014.12.29)", "source": "https://youtu.be/QiR6yJbFCfM", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Beer4TheBeerGod", "published_at_timestamp": 1419894093}, {"objectID": "373678150", "question": "The Church of the Journey is a very interesting concept to me.

I don't think it was-... 'cause but they had like a skill - they were really adept at flying in hyper-, in light speed or something. I don't recall.WW: Uh, no.

Is there a way (or plan to develop a way) to be an \"observer\" in a multiplayer match?Specifically, will I be able to observe a dogfight (preferably a head-to-head dogfight) and be able to \"trail\" one player?", "answer": "Yes, we are actually actively--on our list of things to do, is spectator mode. To allow people to come into spectator mode, and we were thinking it would be a really good way where maybe there's a couple of open clients where someone can just come in as a spectator.And we may even have an auto-spectator mode that we power up that could stream to Twitch and stuff like that, because it's definitely kind of fun. I mean we all around here right now are watching people play the game via twitch, and it's pretty informative. It's strangely engrossing.But our auto-spectator mode will do things like allow you to switch to follow different players and all that kind of stuff.So there you go, although before anyone starts [CONCERN&acirc;&bdquo;&cent;] forum threads, we will make sure that if that feature's enabled, it won't be in such a way that it could give away information in a competitive match that you wouldn't want to give away.", "published_at": "2014-06-23", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 26.

At least they would clean it up and not weather it as much, and that will be part of the repair costs.But we have to figure that out, it would obviously look kind of silly if one wing is nice and shiny and all the other ones are all weathered. Generally the overall wear and tear on the ship is on a global basis.It's essentially something where we say \"It's got this much wear and tear on a scale from 0-10\" and that scale increases over time, over engagements, and occasionally when you take the ship in to a landing port you can basically have it detailed if you want to think of it that way, or put it into a repair shop and they'll roll everything back a little bit. It will probably even it all out and that will be part of the standard repair process.It probably won't roll it all the way back to completely pristine, but everything will get to be a fairly even level across the ship.", "published_at": "2014-04-28", "title": "10 for the Chairman Episode 18.

But also, there would have to be, like if someone is a trader and they're really good, and they're pretty defensive and strong, then they could match up against someone that was a strong pirate. It sort of depends.But that's part of what we're going to do in the dogfighting, just on a base dogfighting level.We're going to do some basic stat tracking and we're going to decide what we think the best stats to track in terms of matchmaking people are. 'Cause partly the matchmaking also will be based on organizations, allegiances, who your friends are, who your enemies are, that kind of stuff.So it's still a little too early to tell, but I would definitely think that the kill count would factor into it.", "published_at": "2014-02-24", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 09 (2014.02.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Q4OB9Yfo-0Q", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "[LYS] Clutch", "published_at_timestamp": 1393282759}, {"objectID": "10e314da496a73_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "While I see what you mean about four Hornets being able to defeat one fully manned Constellation, that seems like it would make it a kind of stupid decision for four people to decide to man one ship. I mean, in real life, there would be a gigantic monetary reason for something like that. (Assuming that the Constellation would cost significantly less than four smaller ships.) But in a game where basically everyone will own their own ship, it raises the question, \"Why would four people ever fly together?\"", "answer": "Flying with your friends is more about helping out someone in need, or in the case of something like the Constellation if you have 3 sets of player eyes and hands (short range fighter, turret with 360 degree field of fire) you will operate at peak efficiency. You can do well with one player - but if you want to beat say 3-4 enemy fighters , having real players vs AI will be a big leg up", "user": "shadmere", "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12grru/i_am_chris_roberts_creator_of_wing_commander/c6uytul/", "published_at_timestamp": 1351771200, "title": "r/IAmA: Chris Roberts", "type": "reddit"}]
