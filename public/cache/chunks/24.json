These maximum-security facilities were reputed to be the most secure in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) and were used to house political dissidents opposed to the Messer regime. Following the fall of the Messers in 2792, the Governors Council of Charon III ordered that the prisons be torn down and published evidence of previously unproven atrocities committed against the prisoners by the former government. In the subsequent public uproar, Charon III voted to renounce its UEE recognition.</p><br/><h1>Foundation</h1><br/><p>Shortly after Livia Messer III ascended to Imperator in 2628, she presented a proposal to the Senate to build a special maximum-security prison under the sole jurisdiction of the Imperator in the sparsely populated state of Dellin on Charon III. The project would kickstart the struggling economy with new jobs and an influx of government funds. The Senate granted near-unanimous approval.</p><br/><p>The first prison, completed in 2630, injected enough money into the economy that the population of Charon III sharply rose. By the time Imperator Corsen Messer V ascended in 2643, the once-rural colony in Dellin had become an urbanized center of commerce based around Livia\u2019s prison. Corsen ordered the construction of more facilities in Dellin and its neighboring state Acheron after a meeting with the Governors Council of Charon III in 2644. The largest of these, Orville, became the central processing center for all new prisoners. The collective of facilities was named the Empire\u2019s Light Conversion Centers (ELCC). During this time, Charon III\u2019s economy boomed. In 2670, Corsen sent a decree to the Senate ordering the recognition of Charon III. A former Representative of Dellin, Gwen Czukay, was sworn in as the planet\u2019s first Senator and the world was officially recognized under its new name, Haros.</p><br/><h1>Life in the Prisons</h1><br/><p>The largest group of prisoners were political dissidents. These included deserters from the military, Xi\u2019an sympathizers, former members of the press, protestors, social organizers, violent agitators, and even politicians. Anyone who acted or spoke against the edicts of the Messer government was in danger of being imprisoned on Haros. Convictions weren\u2019t necessary; being arrested for a political crime was enough to put someone in Orville, ostensibly to await a fair trial. Many died there, waiting for hearings that were never granted. Contact was not allowed with the outside world.</p><br/><p>Prisoners were put to work producing components for the UEE military or low-cost goods to be used by public welfare programs. Their meals were bland but nutritionally complete, and medical care was available to those who took ill so that they could continue to work until they died of old age or exhaustion. When Astrid Messer VII ascended to Imperator in 2697, standards of living in the ELCCs, already poor, plummeted. Funds meant for prisoner welfare were redirected to military resources. Malnutrition, dehydration, exhaustion, and disease became the leading causes of death.</p><br/><p>Under Samuel Messer VIII, who ousted Astrid from power in 2701, a new decree set interment limits so that old-age prisoners would be killed to make room for new ones. The dead were interred in mass graves in the Dellin desert.</p><br/><p>Rumors about the deplorable conditions in the ELCCs began to spread among the people of Haros, though no hard evidence could be found. Any workers suspected of leaking information were themselves at risk of imprisonment and all civilian protesters were incarcerated or killed, eventually quelling any kind of organized protest against the prisons. In 2751, the military began testing bioweapons on segments of Orville\u2019s populace. Bodies buried in the desert leached chemicals and radiation into the already poor soil, fueling a new collective action among the populace of Haros. Though any dissent was brutally suppressed, protests increased in frequency for the following few decades.</p><br/><h1>Liberation</h1><br/><p>When news of Imperator Linton Messer XI\u2019s death in 2792 reached the populace of Haros, they stormed the prisons, liberating those inside. They arrested or killed any guards who hadn\u2019t fled and broke into offices previously sealed off to the public, recovering centuries of documentation on acts of torture, murder, and other atrocities conducted by those who ran and guarded the prisons. First-hand accounts from the formerly incarcerated were compiled and sent to media organizations across the UEE. Senator Constance Whittlefield of Haros was arrested on charges of fraud. In 2795, the planet voted to renounce their recognition of the UEE and revert to their former designation of Charon III.</p><br/><p>Even after the Messers were permanently ousted from power and a new, progressive government reformed under Imperator Erin Toi, Charon III refused to rejoin the UEE, citing their forced participation in crimes against Humanity as reason enough to permanently remain independent. The government then razed the prisons to the ground.

How do we how do we get the server frame rate up?  Is it just refining physics?  Is it buying bigger servers or better servers and just increasing the cost of running the game to an unmanageable thing?", "answer": "BB: Well, so so you're right. Like our our game servers do perform a lot of physics calculations and a lot of physics simulation. That's the nature of the game. Right. You know, thrusters, ship simulation. Like we we track so many types of geometries in the physics engine. It's it's it's crazy. Like we have a really great physics framework in the engine. For sure, like the the most immediate gain there is going to is server meshing for sure. Like we've seen in our play test significant frame rate increase across the board for areas because you have less physical entities. Right. In general, so that means less geometry, less allocations, less simulation. You know, think of the server frame rate as a as a bunch of phases. Right. And it's the engine is extremely well multi-threaded, meaning that we can do a lot of things in parallel. But the challenge there is always determining what we can do in parallel that doesn't have impact with other things. So what can we actually simulate that doesn't depend on anything else? And so that's true of entities. So when we do an entity pass or what we call an ECU update. So that's every frame. And it's true of physics. So and it's true of networking. So all these phases at some point need to wait at the end of a frame for everybody to be completed before. And so obviously this is all bound on entity count and also physical entity count. So server meshing is the from the top is going to reduce that count by a lot because you have way less areas to simulate. So less entities to simulate means, you know, that the overall wait time across the frame will be better. And so that's the first gain for sure. Right. And then we can control that granularity as our machine technology moves up. We can control the zones, the size of the zones that we want to simulate. Now, that doesn't mean that we can't have an area that's filled with something. And it's going to have a high, you know, either network or engine cost or physics time cost.<br/><br/>JH: Oh, yeah, because you know, you know, when we increase the player counts to 800, all 800 are going to go and cram themselves into the same 890 jump.<br/><br/>BB: Of course, of course. And so that's a bit why you're going to see some jitters, especially, you know, with cargo. We're putting a bit more on the gameplay side. We're putting a bit more of the physics on the spotlight because we're using them to move, you know, with tractor beams, moving boxes, things like that. And so, of course, we're looking at improvements. But the first one, well, metrics has actually already given us quite a bit of very interesting things to look at. And so that's, I'm very hopeful that our radar is talking about there is going to allow us to find even more optimizations there that we can do. There's always optimizations, guys, by the way, it's always a thing. But server meshing will definitely help quite a bit. We've seen that in the last test. Like, you know, even with the very large shards, servers were running on average much higher frame rate than our current game shards. So I'm really hopeful for those gains because that's going to be a game changer for the game. Like, obviously, performance for the game. You know, if we gain, you know, one millisecond on frame time, that's one millisecond directly to your gameplay.

We currently see microTech scheduled for 3.8 but not SSOCS. Why is that?", "answer": "They don't want to commit to release dates quite yet for SSOCS because things are still in flux. They can consider content swaps if they wanted to add in a new area and take something out to account for it. That said, no decisions have been made on that. Even if they released SSOCS earlier than they anticipated, they wouldn't know what the result would be because they'd have to measure. That is to say, any time an optimisation is implemented, they don't know if the job is done until they've taken a measurement to be able to conclude that it's working. So even after they've got SSOCS done, it's not a guarantee that they can keep increasing the content, and they may find that the gains aren't as much as they'd like, which would require them seeking other solutions. So these details will become more clear as the plan for SSOCS gets filled out and as they do more testing and can actually say with more confidence what the performance behaviour is.<br />Todd adds that microTech and New Babbage are still being built, so no matter what the Content Team will still be working on those locations. He continues to say that when they get the LODs, the AI, and all the other downstream dependencies in there, then that will give them an accurate profile for them to know whether the server will be able to handle it and if it can't, then they evaluate and consider taking something out, or the server can handle it and everything's okay. Part of the benefit of SSOCS is that it allows them to stream out areas where no Players are, but there's an unknown about how much that impacts the universe, because if your most expensive assets and content areas are the popular Landing Zones, depending on Player habits and where they go, they might find that those areas are constantly streamed in and are effectively pinned to always be streamed in.<br />So whilst they do stream out most of the PU, it can end up not impacting their performance issues that much because most of their performance issues are at those large Landing Zones. What they're more confident that SSOCS will do is make it so that the universe can be more detailed, so they could add much more outposts or truck stops or whatever, because if the server is capped at 50 Players then it doesn't matter if there's 1000 outposts, because only 50 can get loaded in at any given time. Chad says it gives a kind of upward maximum on the maximum distribution of what can be loaded in (I think he just means it increases their maximum load limit). But really it comes down to what the reality is in terms of performance, which they'll have to measure, because if the reality is that the Landing Zones get streamed out half of the time, then that might be good enough.<br />Jared specifically responds to why SSOCS isn't on the Roadmap, saying that it's not a list of things that are in development, but a list of things that they think and feel confident that they'll deliver on time to be included in a particular patch - it doesn't always work out that way, but with something as big as SSOCS they want to make sure they're more confident about when they can deliver it before adding it to the Roadmap.", "title": "Star Citizen Live: All About Development", "source": "https://youtu.be/wENuiIcPK10", "transcript": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/d1e27o/a_summary_of_star_citizen_live_all_about/", "type": "youtube", "time": "30m21s", "published_at_timestamp": 1567797154}, {"objectID": "17311f7012fb20_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "We'll evaluate this once the ability to use FPS weapons in vehicle seats comes online.

With space, for dimensions it\u2019s easier for point of interests to get lost or forgotten. How will this work in a physical place like planets? Will items, place of interests on a planet persist and will the coordinate data get lost over time? Or is there something else planned for planets?", "answer": "So we\u2019re planning to have various types of persistence when it comes to both space and planets. Everything that\u2019s massive and it\u2019s a recognizable element or it\u2019s big enough that it won\u2019t disappear in a few moments will be persistent, it will always be there. Once you find it, you will have the coordinates for it and you can always get there fast, not fast, but get there easily without having to find it again.<br /><br />We will also have missions and points of interests that are not so big like a crashed ship in a desert. That is a ship that you find today,tomorrow, the sand might come over it again. So we\u2019re okay with that disappearing and being phased out. So there will always be new things we generate on those planets so the more you find stuff there, we\u2019ll try to spawn more and more and the system will try to balance between\u2026 so stuff doesn\u2019t get completely discovered on a planet.<br /><br />On the other side, planets are still pretty huge. I mean planets if you think in other games, they\u2019re small, our planets are proper planetside. You have to consider how long it would take you to map the earth, you know it would take quite a while. There\u2019s 6 billion of us and we still don\u2019t know a lot about the Earth so hopefully it will be that rich, our planet's will be that rich.<br /><br />Also you will find three points on this planets, he will find three points, everyone will find other things. How you share that information with each other is all up to you.

I don't know how many people are there but I know there were more people last time I visited recently. All primarily English speaking: I think there's some other languages in there too, but I don't know them off the top of my head. There has been some early, early discussion &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; really early &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; of having native German speakers. Obviously being here in Germany and interacting with the German fans, although there's a large amount of English that's spoken, things are always, in my opinion, a little more comfortable in their native language. So with such a large German community, and I know the communities are large everywhere, but with such a large German community that's where we've had those early discussions. That position could be here in Frankfurt, I think, which would make sense because they could interact with directly with people here too if needed. But it could also be in the UK embedded with the other team. So ... yeah ... I mean that's still to be seen.As far as Frankfurt studio and growing, I'd say in most departments we're still growing. We're still looking for a few more people on ... for cutscenes. As an overview we're hoping to drive cutscenes, we have a large portion on design here, on producing weapons, on AI code, and with engine code. With weapons we're fully sorted out as far as team size goes. And different departments are at a slightly different state or various, right? What we're pretty ... we're getting pretty close to to capacity. As I mentioned briefly, recently in an ATV, we're going to do an expansion so we can build out the rest of the team and everybody can fit here comfortably. But yeah, as a general overview most disciplines we're hiring for whether that's art, whether that's code,  QA, etc. But we're doing pretty good filling up with what we need.Also important to point out, we're not hiring people to hire people. We have a specific plan in place. We have a headcount plan based off of the work that's needed, based off of our dates and so on. So all of the hiring, all the planning, all of the expansions that we doing and the building up of the teams is all based on a specific growth and schedule that we're doing.

Can we move a low poly geometry back around the female characters and will that suffice or do we need to have a resculpt of everything in like, there's just so, so much we need to create.So, what we're essentially trying to do is what is the best use of techniques that we can use to address the problem. The problem is clothing all of these females. We can go in one way, which is like manpower and actually go in, sculpt all the variations of clothes, which we might have to do, and then there's other things, \"Well maybe they can share boots?\" and then we're going through and there's so many pieces that were like, \"Okay well we can share hats. We can scale the hats down. Alright, now what about hair? What about this? What about that?\" and then we find a way to really nail down the male and then find out all the parts that comprise a male character, which we already have, then we could use that immediately and go and say, \"So this worked for this character, now let's go to the female character.\"So it's not necessarily the fact that like oh we're not making female characters. It's just a fact of well, once we find a way that works and this like... is 100% the way we want to go. Then it'll trickle down to every other character in the entire game even alien races talking about armor classes you know and this kind of stuff, 'cause we're all still figuring out what's the best way performance-wise. We have to figure out how all these people are going to share these things. How many gigs is the game going to be. These kinds of things that we're taking into consideration  and the more things that we can share, the better.So, really it's just the fact of, we're looking into the best way to make the females use the most out of what we've already made and bring them to you in the best way possible, rather than just throwing something together and sculpting it and being like, \"Here she is\" and she fits awkwardly in like a male's clothing. You know?Adam Wieser: Yeah, you know I, can't really speak to, the tech behind the female character, but I have seen some of the female clothes in engine. You know, just kind of hanging up the, on the fake racks or on the fake mannequins and stuff like that. And the female clothes look awesome.OA: Yeah.AW: They look really, really good. Like the, whoever put that together and did all of that work it looks, it looks really, really fantastic. So it's, it'll be exciting to get those integrated into the game, because there's already been a lot of care, a lot of thought put into that. So, yeah. Once, those hurdles are over there ... there's already a bunch of stuff that's, there and ready, to be populated and help make the world even look better than it is.OA: Yeah,  it's really, it's really important to get those, to get those things down. I mean 'cause really it's like there's, there's one guy right? There's the bald white dude.AW: Yeah.OA: That's what our character is, bald white male, but we have a variety of characters. What we want to do is we want to find out, \"Okay here are the costumes\" and then with man hours we have to work on this kind of head, we fix this, we find out, \"Okay well maybe we need to tweak this in the texture maps and this kind of stuff\". So then all of a sudden instead of getting like one head that you can choose from a week, why don't we just implement ten so you have a variety and when we introduce those ten why don't we also introduce the female at this time. So it's just, a tech and time thing. I mean there's not I don't even try to make a raceAW: Slow and steady, just yeah, just slow and steady.

It would be ridiculously oversized it wouldn't work, so really we don't expect for this to happen. You're not going to be killing a Vanduul and ripping off pieces of armour and just taping it on me ala Transformers \"Take my parts\". Type thing.

I recognize this may just be folks messing about and testing the limits of the new environment. However, what long term plans/ideas do you have to deter or punish players for poor behaviour? For example: car jacking and murder have real consequences.", "answer": "I think we generally get this question fairly often. So to give you my idea of what the approach is going to be, I view the Mini PU as our sandbox testbed, and I don't want to build in a \"nanny state\" from the beginning. I don't want to be in a situation where we're trying to figure out all the ways people can abuse the system. I'd rather put a system in and just see what happens. And then as things happen we go \"okay, this is where people abuse it so we're now going to put this kind of system in\".And we've always had plans for bounties on people and both NPC and player enforcement of other players that are essentially attacking people when they shouldn't be attacking which could be griefing or could be piracy in a safe zone or whatever.So right now in Crusader there's just a safe green zone around Port Olisar. But what we're going to do is, and this will be in one of the future builds, I don't know whether it's the next major one or the one afterwards, but we're going to start to put in a kind of enforcement system. So if you attack someone in an area you shouldn't, you know, there isn't authorised PVP, then if there's communication satellites around, and the attack was broadcast by the Black Box then \"bam\" all of a sudden there may be a bounty on your head. And other players can go after you and actually earn Alpha UEC for taking you out and there'll be NPC police that would also be going after it.As we get more persistence in the game, which is also one of the big feature sets that is in one of the future patches, we're also starting to put in some of that sort of reputation and, I don't whether you want to call it \"law enforcement\" but just enforcing rules of conduct in various areas of space.But we'd also have emergent gameplay so for instance, in Crusader right now the Comm Satellites are off-line and one of the ideas is in all regulated systems they have these Comm Satellites around and so if your ship gets blown up or attacked it can do its Black Box message and say \"oo, I was attacked by so-and-so in their ship\" and it goes \"well wait a minute that was a safe zone and that shouldn't have really happened\" and it gets transferred through the Comm Satellites and \"bam\" all of a sudden now you are in the UEE network of someone that's performed a crime and potentially there's a bounty on your head, etc. etc.Well, one of the cool emergent gameplay things is, if you were planning, say, to jack a convoy and there's some really valuable gold on this convoy but it was only going to go through the safe space then perhaps it's worth it to go and spend some time to try and disable the Comm Satellites. Maybe you have a crew, a bunch of people, go disable the Comm Satellites so a little area goes dark and then \"bam\" you jump on the convoy, rip it off, head out before the Comm Satellites are brought back up. And, of course, the missions would probably be spawned in the Persistent Universe at that time where \"oh, the Comm Satellite's down, we need to go fix it\" which is kind of what you're seeing a little bit Crusader right now in 2.1 and it was in 2.0 as well. But this would be ... there would be a reason for the Comm Satellite and why it was there and why pirates would take it down.So we're going to try and put these play mechanisms in that will sort of be like the real world where there are consequences for doing things but you can also try to be a criminal but it is a lot of work so you should really only do it if it was for something that would be really high yield. And we'll try to make it for people that are more griefing, that it's just not really something that would be beneficial, like they'll waste more time respawning and doing stuff than they would griefing a new player.So we'll see but that's the whole idea of having the Mini PU is we put it out there and then we start to build structure on top of it. It will be kind of interesting so we'll try to get some of this basic stuff I've talked about out in the next few patches. Not sure if it will make 2.2 but 2.3 and onwards. So look forward to that because I think it will actually be kind of fun when you see player behaviour be shaped by more and more of these rules and see which people fall in the side of enforcement and keeping the law and which fall on the side of piracy and criminality.

While it is difficult to design interfaces for components that haven't been fleshed out yet, the happy answers for us is we don't need to. What we do is determine the actual physical sizes of the screen that are going to serve as the bed for the actual interaction. Then the team that is responsible for doing this interaction such as eWar or other things such as ship power management in any of the stations that we have, they have to work actually designing the systems and the interface along with the UI team for how it's going to work.We basically have a big blank canvas that we just need to position and make useful within the ship, so that part of it is rather easy, we design the space so the player can take that station and then the magic of the design system once it comes online simply shows up on that screen and the player is able to interact with that. So kind of roundabout answer to your question but I hope that serves to describe how we do our ship interior design when we're in the white box phase.Randy Vasquez: The two ships that I've worked on so far were the Starliner which had a whole other host of interior designs and layouts so we when through all those iterations, which you guys have hopefully seen; and then the next I'll hopefully be able to show them all the interior designs and layouts for the Caterpillar. All the interiors are crazy and I'm making sure they fit within the FPS metrics and I'm making sure that they are fitting for the hull of the ship, the exterior, making sure it just matches with the ship itself. It is a blank canvas. It sometimes gets a little overwhelming especially at starting: like what can I do with this?KT: There's going to be systems that we haven't designed yet because of the particular type of x the character's going to have but we know that we need to make a station for say doing cargo management. We know that we have a 16:9 space that we need to fill the screen with when the player is manning that station so we design that space. And when that particular gameplay is fleshed with its UI it will magically overlay onto that space that we've set aside for that particular mechanic.RV: Some of the stuff we talked about with multi-crew and everything and then working with the designers in the UK and working with Zane and everything for all the different screens, the seats, the functions of those seats, what each one does: all that stuff is really coming on board so hopefully when you guys actually get to play with more of the multi-crew stuff then you'll be able to see a lot more of the designs come alive and we'll keep pushing the envelope of what we want from intention of what Star Citizen is.KT: Good plug.

Does this mean that certain career paths (exploration, for example) that necessitate travel into uncontrolled or uncharted space will be impossible to pursue without the possibility of PvP?", "answer": "It's a good question, you know there is a certain amount of you're traveling into uncharted space, then it's not likely there's going to be other players out there because you're one of the first people out there so even if there was pvp out there, you're not likely to engage in it. One of the bigger points of exploration is that you're going to go to areas others have not gone to before. You'll sort of chart off the unbeaten path I was just mentioning before on sort of the coordinate space and navigation points, so it's a pretty good question, I would say that the pvp slider would come into effect there where that would reduce the chance of you having an encounter with someone that would be hostile, but you know if it's totally uncontrolled then it's out then there would be a small remote possibility of pvp out there so sort of depending, we'll see how it goes, it's kind of a part of getting it all up and running for the folks, which is what I would recommend doing. I know a lot of people are worried oh there isn't enough pvp or omg I'll be forced into pvp, I think we got a pretty good answer in the way we set it up, we'll have stuff that will be good for both parties, both groups so lets wait till we get there and if it's not working perfectly we'll try our best to balance and fix things.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 68", "source": "https://youtu.be/FkjfyVDhzNs", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Monkeytime", "published_at_timestamp": 1443477905}, {"objectID": "373681400", "question": "I was wondering if there will be some kind of Cargo storage facility that will be player owned or a place where we can rent a space for storing our excess stuff?

Your hangar will have cargo storage capacity and you will be able to rent storage capacity on various planets. So you could be far away from your home where your hangar is and still go and rent space for storage on another planet, like renting storage in the real world.

Will all the NPC's (90% of PU population) exist within the universe constantly with their movements and actions tracked in a limited fashion? Will they be randomly generated as players enter instances/zones? How will this calculate into the economy and mission system?", "answer": "We actually have a full Universe simulation that runs... we actually don't need it to run on any particular bank of servers. It just actually runs on one server, and it simulates about 20 million AI agents. It simulates the AI agents in a very sort of high-level manner. Ok, you've got a mission, you're going to go from here to here, so it's not simulating it on the fidelity level that you would do when you're actually connected to the game and flying around and doing combat maneuvers or flying from point to point, it's simulating it more in the &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; here's the jobs, here's the missions, here's the market demand, here's the things that are happening &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; ok, you've taken a mission to take these goods from planet A to planet B, so you've now taken that job off the market. Now you're going to go from planet A to planet B, so that's just a line trace, that trip's going to take, say, whatever it would be, a day of game time, and then along the way there's a chance that you could fight or run into some pirates, and if they do we resolve that combat. If you're not there, kind of more like a dice roll, but if you are there, in the area, this all gets sort of created, spawned in where you are &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; you will see the result, the actual combat will end up getting spawned in, and you'll see it play out, and the result of it will be fed back to the Universe server simulation. So the Universe simulation keeps track of all the NPC's. It's the one that's dealing with the goods and the markets, the economy nodes, so on various planets there'll be things that produce, things that consume, so there's sort of a very high-level meta AI that's running on the economy simulation. And from that high-level simulation we can track the sort of movement, the populations, the progress of AI, in a sort of much higher-level, abstracted way, and of course since that doesn't need to be real time, like you flying around, we can time slice it, which is why we can simulate so many agents. So, we're not having to do 20 million agents at 30fps at all, so you can update every single agent maybe every 5 minutes, or every 10 minutes, and that's how you can manage so many of them. In the time scale the Universe happens, it doesn't need to be the same sort of fidelity that we do on the game server, which is, that's the one where, in Arena Commander now, if you connect and dogfight with someone, the game server is what's sort of running you and the other clients running, and it's worrying about simulating where the bullets are, and all the ins and outs of the high fidelity flight and the combat. So, essentially the NPC population is mostly simulated. I think that, on some level, we don't necessarily simulate every individual person on a planet, so like a planet would say, okay, here's your general population, and that general population where missions have to happen could spawn certain number of bounty-hunters, or a certain number of traders or haulers or cargo folks. And then they will take their missions and then that particular ship... we sort of simulate the ships, and the missions that are happening on an individual basis, and then when you're on the planet, there'll be a setup of here's the population going up and down, is it things going well on the planet, then if so, more people are arriving there, population's getting bigger, it's expanding, if things aren't doing so well, it'd be the [opposite] one.But it's a pretty decent, high-level simulation, and that information is then fed to the system servers and the game servers, and that will help determine, when you're flying around, whether or not you will encounter NPC's or not, and whether those NPC's are fighting each other, in conflict, or what's happening. So, one of the cool things is, we'll have a living breathing world happening, irrelevant of how many actual players are playing. So, there could be only one person playing in the Star Citizen Universe &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; I mean I hope to god not &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; but if there was, there would still be a living, breathing Universe, people going about their daily lives, trading, being Pirates, being bounty hunters, being miners, all of that sort of stuff. So I think when that all comes online and comes together, I think it'll be very cool. We currently have the Universe Simulation happening on a server, and we have an interface where there's the communication of kind of what you would, this is the kind of thing you would see if you're in this area, and that's all in progress so...", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 62", "source": "https://youtu.be/zt4r3ksHXng", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Materix, definition of awesome", "published_at_timestamp": 1438639238}, {"objectID": "11f6e6ce483f54_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The boarding process will involve the same 'security scan' recently developed for customs checkpoints.

I want to do one where I'm a mercenary/pirate and stuff like that and seriously just get in that whole clandestine thing and like be on that black market. I think that would be hilariously fun cause I never play that kind of character. Usually when I play an online game I'm either support or a healer.Of course the other one I would play would be a miner. Like when I played Eve, I was all about being a miner and a trader. So I think that would be really cool. Just doing some mining, doing some cargo stuff, that's why I like when I was given the ship the Caterpillar... I was like all about it cause it had that different mix of things that I was like, 'I can do this'...Vincent Sinatra: There you go.RV: I can do this. I'm actually looking really forward to just..VS: That sounds pretty good.RV: It's going to change.VS: Like you said everything is like a moving target but yeah that's pretty good.

Then you know, \"hey guys, they're over here\" and we swoop in and destroy you all.RV: I think we did a play test what is it, a month or two ago, and basically I think it was McCall or might have been you I think was like, 'by the way guys, Vasquez is at Port Kariya'.VS: Oh yeah.RV: Next thing I know I had like four or five ships coming in and I was like, 'oh god' and then I'm trying to hide from everybody. I shot at a few people but I think I shot Jeremiah.VS: That's what I'll be, I'll be an information broker who then leaks out where CIG's people are and then people can go hunt them and have fun doing that.RV: Nice, nice.VS: Make a little you know...RV/VS: Money on the side.VS: A little bit.

I'm not so sure it'll be in V1.0, just because we have SO much stuff to do, but that's definitely on the agenda/list. So you could fly around, go down to planets, if it's a seedy planet you might walk around and get mugged by some NPC, or maybe a gambling den etc. We'll do all we can to make space, planets and everything in between feel alive and real, so having different things you can do, like poker against other players, would add to that feeling.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 39 (2014.09.29)", "source": "https://youtu.be/7mTLWkxEEeo", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Damonicas", "published_at_timestamp": 1412028036}, {"objectID": "373678990", "question": "Since we have rovers for some of the Constellations (and maybe other ships as well) will there be different sizes (say hover bike) for other options?

So obviously there's the buggy that we've seen in the hangar, there's the rover that we unveiled when we showed of the Aquila version of the Constellation, and I definitely think there will be some smaller ones, and some bigger ones, and some luxury models. And yeah, kinda the idea is on a longer-term basis, we want to build some areas that you can land and you can explore that aren't the same as like landing in a, you know, necessarily landing in a busy city spaceport and then you walk around. So you know, perhaps you land in a sort of open area of countryside and there's maybe some ruins off in the distance, and you get in your buggy and you can drive around and do some exploration.So that's sort of the longer-term plan, and that's where some of the procedural work that we're doing some R&D on would help come into play. So I don't know how much of that will be in the very first \"complete\" version of the Persistent Universe, but it would be something that's in the development pipeline and we would try to get up and running as soon as possible, 'cause having various areas, or some PvE exploration and combat down on planets or in derelicts out in space, or in abandoned asteroid bases, is something that's kind of a high priority for us, 'cause I think it will just add a lot of texture to the world itself. So it's not just about flying around in space combat - there's other action that's happening.

So the idea is, just like a 3-series BMW is pretty common, and it has (it used to have anyway) the 315, and the 325, and the 330, and a diesel version... and they've probably got a hybrid version now, or an electric version... So, for the common ships, so things like the Aurora obviously, the Hornet, the 300i, the Freelancer, the Constellation, the Cutlass, will all have variants. And then a couple of other ones the Mustang, which is meant to be a starter ship, would probably have some variants. And then some of the bigger ships - the more unique ships - won't necessarily have variants, or if they do have a variant it may be, \"here's the military version, here's the civilian version\". So that's kind of our rule of thumb, but it's not set in stone but we do think the more common ships would probably have different variants for different roles. And then of course on top of that, you can take the base hull and then add on different equipment and items to sort of further customize it towards the role you want to play when you're flying around in space.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 29.

And on top of that I have some idea for negotiating price to make it fun and also I kind of want to make the gameplay be very focused around forcing you as a player to venture around the universe. So for instance you shouldn't be able to go to every planet and buy exactly the same ships on every planet, so I want you to be able to go from one corner of the galaxy because this is the place that makes the best dogfighter and the other side of the galaxy is the place that makes the best information runner, so you sort of go around and adventures around to buy different equipment and different ships, so you make the trek to go to this one corner in the universe where the guy is the best gunsmith every and he can increase the range of your long range ballistic weapon by 20% and so the idea would be you would sort of fly around the galaxy and cover a lot of light years trying to make sure that you got the best weapon or the ship you want and all the rest of the stuff so I think it will be more so than privateer, more so than freelancer, and I think it will work quite well.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 06 (2014.01.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/NcRxuvQT3Ew", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Bigbadabum", "published_at_timestamp": 1390598024}]
