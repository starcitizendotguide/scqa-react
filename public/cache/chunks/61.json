I would say that there will be places that it will be almost impossible to do anything in, and then there will be places where there is security and armistice zones that if you're very determined and shut down security systems and do everything else, you could potentially cause some mayhem. And we'll gradually build that in such a way so that, like... probably doing a terrorist attack on Terra is gonna be out of the question but there may be some space stations and stuff that are kind of in between where maybe the security isn't as close to the power of the UEE, although it does have security and law enforcement. But a determined group of pirates could for a very short period of time cause some mayhem there. And it'll sort of be... we'll have a few of those, we'll have some safe places and then we'll have some completely unsafe places, and probably the risk-reward of all those places will be factored in.So you can probably make the most money in the unsafest areas, but of course there's a higher risk. In the safe areas you don't make as much money say trading or doing stuff but it's pretty safe and you're not likely to be attacked and if you are attacked there's a lot of backup and help that would show up. But we will make it so that for instance perhaps there could be a heist in a really, like... something like the Terra system for a cargo ship full of gold bullion or something, but that heist would have to be incredibly well planned. Think of it like the \"Heat\" heist, at the beginning of the film \"Heat\" with DeNiro and Pacino - where you would have to take down all the security systems, and do all this, and coordinate, and do it all at once, and you would have a window of a very small amount of time before you get away with the loot. Those kind of heists would be much more NPC AI driven in terms of what you're heisting. So maybe that shipment is something that's getting shipped from the Bank of Terra to somewhere else and someone else gets wind of it, and it's a criminal mission and then of course it could also be players and other AI that are also performing security. So that would be really hard to do but if you managed to do it the payoff would be really big. And of course you obviously have the risk of being a wanted person and all the rest of the stuff. We'll sort of build those aspects in. So we're going to have areas that we'll let that kind of gameplay work and, like I said, potentially there can be some less safe space stations. But there will definitely be some places that aren't just going to let you go in and destabilize. So like Terra or Earth - those kinds of one's will be pretty safe havens, and even when you go down onto them, to pass through the customs or immigration you'll have to cash in or pass in your weapons that you have. You can't take any weapons with you and they'll scan you going through and I think if you look at the ArcCorp you'll see the scanner setup and everything.So you have to land on the outside and pass through Customs and it's all sort of secure. And there'll be some places that don't have that I definitely think Nyx (or really Levski) will be less secure in the long run and that would have more \"law on the ground\" so to speak. So if you went in there and everyone took a gun and they started shooting, then maybe the local Police guys would come after you. But that's sort of the things we'll play with. So there'll definitely be places that will be safe and there'll be places that won't be safe. And that'll be kind of up to you and what sort of challenge you're interested in.", "published_at": "2016-04-11", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 82", "source": "https://youtu.be/3stBTV7QZzk", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "WLB", "published_at_timestamp": 1460414681}, {"objectID": "373675350", "question": "It has been mentioned that Bengal Carriers are available to civilians only for taking by force as wrecks for \"fixing up\". Would the Crucible-based External Repair Structure by typically used in that process to the point where it can move itself to a place more suited for an overhaul than the presumably dangerous place it was found in?", "answer": "Matt Sherman: So a Crucible, not by itself. Bengals are giant ships, so that's going to be something where you and a few friends in multiple crucibles are gonna want to roll over to that thing and start getting it fixed up. Because if you've managed to make one of those things dead in the water. That's no small amount of damage that you're going to have to fix up on this thing.Calix Reneau: Yeah the Crucible will be able to perform repair actions on things like the Bengal. They'll be able to repair hull damage, fix up breaches, do component repair in the field to a much greater degree than you could do by hand. However, the Crucible is limited in its cargo space and there are some components on the Bengal which are larger than the Crucible can carry. So, if one of those is broken beyond repair and must be replaced then you're going to have to find a way around that. It won't be a single Crucible job. I don't see that being the case for most of our larger ships, I think that you'll probably want to have two or three at minimum if you're going to be taking care of capital class ships.MS: Yeah, smaller ships like a Constellation, a single Crucible should be a good...CR: YeahMS: A good enough...CR: Easy.MS: ...to do a field refit on it. But the capital ship power plants and shield generators, these are massive room-sized installations. So, you're going to need something with a lot of bulk carrying capacity to get these bigger components over to those ships. Even if if the Crucible can still manipulate and get into place, it can't bring that with it because it will just be over capacity.", "published_at": "2015-06-29", "title": "10 for the Designers: Episode 05 (2015.06.29)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Neo404oDUyI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Ivan Kintobor", "published_at_timestamp": 1455576909, "time": "18m26s"}, {"objectID": "373679860", "question": "What is your personal history with the Hornet? What inspired it, and what about it do you like, love, hate, and so forth?", "answer": "Well obviously the Hornet was the starter ship in Wing Commander and so having a Hornet in Star Citizen was a nod to that. In Wing Commander it was the light ship. It ended up, when I was designing the Hornet and what we were doing, it felt more like a medium fighter because we had the turret on the middle of it and it just felt like it was a much more heavy hitting fighter than a light fighter would be. But that's essentially the history.A lot of the ships originally in Wing Commander were inspired by World War 2 ships and planes; war at sea and the all rest of that stuff. So you definitely see some nods to present day fighters or older fighters, whether it is the Hornet or other various ships that we have. There was a Sabre obviously, there hasn't been a Gladius, but generally a lot of times we are doing nods to things that you would know in the past that were historical, a ship or a plane or something, that you can then project into the future.", "published_at": "2015-12-21", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 73", "source": "https://youtu.be/MHLwAuM1J8c", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Blue", "published_at_timestamp": 1450739049}, {"objectID": "1e6281bc2cb5ac_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The Carrack is a dedicated explorer, built as a single, self-sustaining ship that can make long-duration voyages through the roughest areas of space.

Will it be more like a traditional game from the past, where one would pick an answer A-D in a pop up window?", "answer": "So, we're trying something very different on SQ42 in terms of conversation. We've gone with the idea, you're in this whole first person world, first person Universe, and so the conversations you get into are from your point of view in first person. They're not limited like if you play something like Mass Effect or Dragon Age, where you click someone and you go into this conversation mode where, there's your character, and the character you're talking to, and it's traditional third person, and it cuts back and forth between what people are saying, and you select ABCDEF, and you have this wheel of conversation options. So one of the big concepts, or tenets, of SQ42, and we're going to bring it across to Star Citizen on the Persistent Universe side, is that the conversation should be fluid, like it is in real life, also the actions that you do, your body language, whether you keep eye contact, it's as important as what you say, so if you're, when you look up at someone, and they catch you and they go oh, hey, hi, and then maybe you can approach them and a conversation would start. And if they're talking to you and you turn away halfway through the conversation, they'll be like hey, what're you doing? And if you don't turn back they'll sort of stop or wander off. You turn back, and 'oh, as I was saying', and there'll be various options for you to influence it. So we have the moments where what we call your 'inner thoughts', there'll be a point where someone says 'what do you think of my flying', and your inner thought, and we're going to be using a technique that's very much like Sherlock, the BBC series, if you've seen it, sort of your thoughts sort of float out in the aether, the 3D space, and you'll hear it as you highlight ones, it'd be like, 'enh, nah, his flying really sucks' or 'Yeah, he's a pretty good flyer', and those are all sort of inner thought, and when you pick the one you like, 'oh no, you really kick ass flying, I really enjoy flying on your wing, you're the best wingman I've ever had. And you'll be able to sort of guide yourself through the conversation, so, between having the branches you can do, and it could be two, three four branches, the system will support all that, or you can even have contextual interactions like look around and, someone's boring you in a conversation and there's a glass of water, well, this is not something we have in SQ42, but an example of it would be, I can see that, I can, want to take a drink, that'll be one action, that'd be the use action, or there'd be 'take a drink' or 'throw water in person's face' and you could do that, and that would be potentially contextual if someone was insulting you in a conversation. So we're going to allow you to interact with things around you, items that could have context and meaning to a conversation, and also thoughts that you would have. And you can walk in and out, and you can move in and out, and it's all very fluid and in first person. It's all very different from a locked-off, ABCDEF kind of branching conversation you've seen before in RPGs and Adventure games, and I think it's going to be very cool. It's very fluid, it's about eye contact and paying attention. If you're doing stupid things like bouncing around and nodding your head, the other character's going to say hey, what're you doing, and pay attention, and just give up on you after a while, and they'll become more annoyed with you, and their approachability and friendliness to you will be decrease. It's really going to be about managing relationships, and who you decide to interact with, in SQ42, and make the friendships with, will affect things down the road and how they react to you. So I'm hoping that that sort of fluid, immersive conversation system will sort of pull you into the world, and also sort of if you spend time interacting with people, talking to people, getting to hear their backstories, getting to know what their hopes and dreams are, then later on if something happens, as it always does in singleplayer stories, maybe the person you'd been talking to, investing time in, gets killed, then it will be pretty emotionally impactful for you. So that's it, it's definitely something we've been thinking about for a long time, sort of the next stage for me of the stuff I want to do, so hopefully you guys will really enjoy it.", "published_at": "2015-07-27", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 61 (2015.07.27)", "source": "https://youtu.be/f8DX2VEeREY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Lee, Adama", "published_at_timestamp": 1438036231}, {"objectID": "267f65591f6b3_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "No promises yet, but we're looking at this!

The hope and talks going on right now is that we're going to have a running tally of all of the exciting things you've done in-game. All of the systems you've visited, all of the people you've interacted with, how many miles you've flown and all that. And the personal journal aspect of it is something we've touched on. It gets a little complicated dynamically creating emotional entries based off of content because we really want the players to have their own sense of personality. So, if the stuff that we're generating for them doesn't quite line up with how they're feeling then it might be a disconnect there so we still have to do more experimentation to figure out if something is going to be on that level. But I think probably the most exciting thing about it is that we have mobiGlas as a way to ground all of that information in lore by using the mobiGlas apps and there'll be a bunch of different ones to track all of the different sorts of information about your character. So, maybe all of the places you visit will be tracked in a travel app on your mobiGlas and stuff like that. So, theming it that way I think will help immersion a lot. For players.

I would say that we haven't really thought about that, so kind of a gut reaction to that is, that's an interesting concept. Normally I think we would... I mean, we were planning to have Arena Commander, well, two things:- To have a sort of competition inside our universe, and so that would actually be kind of cool, if people could compete but you'd have to travel to the system for the tournament, and play there... so that could be a possible cool game element, that sort of is a game within a game and also playing inside our universe.- But in general we were kinda thinking that Arena Commander would just allow you to play with your friends, against other people in general around the universe. And maybe sort of fudge the whole FTL side.But, uhh, I'll take this under consideration because does have some cool mechanics. It's just the downside is you don't really want to be stuck in a system when no one else is around who you can play around or train with, but these will all be things that we'll play with when we get the Persistent Universe up and running because I do like the idea of the game inside the game and then having it adhere to the rules of the universe.", "published_at": "2014-07-14", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 29.

But in general, we want it to have finite pools. So if someone gets to an asteroid field and it's got a really rich seam of minerals that are very valuable, they are a limited quantity, so people would mine them out, then maybe they would have to go off to find some other field or yield for that.So that's kind of the plan. The regeneration question's really just about, we're gonna be adding new systems, so there will be new places for people to find and explore, and obviously new minerals to harvest, so that probably should handle it, but if we run into a problem where everything's mined out right away and we've got nothing to mine, then of course we'd probably start regenerating some elements of it. But I'm hoping we can balance it.One of our goals is to actually run this full economy simulation or universe simulation with no players, with meta-AI that we've talked about, and with all these big macro elements like \"Here's an asteroid field and it has this kind of minerals,\" \"Here's a planet that produces this sort of stuff,\" and then just see how that works, runs, progresses.

Say me and this friend, this friend, and this friend, this is our little unit that's flying as a group, to let the game know that you're flying together.Then it will do things, like determining based on ping would be another criteria, but of course if you say \"I'm flying with this group,\" that takes priority over everything else.Then also what your preference is in terms of combat, whether you want to be doing PvP or want to be fighting NPCs in PvE. That depends on what sort of area of space you're in, but we're not going to match up someone who just wants to be doing PvE in a fairly safe area with someone who just wants to be doing hardcore PvP, 'cause that wouldn't necessarily be a lot of fun for the PvE side, and on the PvP side, there'll be plenty of opportunities to fight other people because we're making sure that there's a lot of benefit to being in the less regulated areas. More risk, more reward so to speak.All those criteria are factored in when we're doing the instancing. We decide, this group of players is coming from here to here, and they may intersect this other group.
