Lumberyard will stream textures but the reason we have these object containers, right now you can turn the object containers on or off, but when you\u2019re in the PU, you can be over here and your friend can be 100,000 miles away and some stuff which happens at one location is affecting the frame rate at the other. There is some extremely basic culling right now but we can do more in this space. We\u2019re not massively render bound right now, the PU is much more CPU bound and we have all these draw calls we\u2019re still drawing even though we don\u2019t need to.<br /><br/>The next big release improves things significantly because of the new object containers which turn stuff on and off, not just turn it off but everything else which is going on in there so people should see a dramatic improvement in performance, not necessarily the finished article, there are still other things to come but this should make things a lot better.", "title": "The Star Citizen Exclusive Interview: Erin Roberts", "source": "http://wccftech.com/star-citizen-exclusive-interview-erin-roberts/", "type": "article", "user": "Adrian Ip", "published_at_timestamp": 1487289600}, {"objectID": "373672920", "question": "How soon will we begin to see the heads on the npcs or players in the PU?

We are working on getting a variety of heads into the Persistent Universe.<br /><br />We\u2019re actually working on some of that stuff now, because we want to mix it up some and obviously we\u2019re, hard at work on Squadron 42, cause as you can appreciate with the \u2026 I mean \u2026 In Squadron 42 we actually have about 350 speaking parts, which is an insane amount of speaking parts. Like \u2026<br /><br />JH: That\u2019s a lot.<br /><br />CR: \u2026 In most movies would have maybe 30, 40 speaking parts or 50 speaking parts. You know, it\u2019s a lot, and so each one of those will obviously need their own unique head. So a lot of it\u2019s going to be supplied by the custom actor\u2019s scans, but some of the stuff will be also done sort of background characters where we would almost assemble the heads kind of like how you would assemble a player head.<br /><br />JH: Much like the character creation that we were talking about earlier, so it is kind of one of those things where once we\u2019ve got that system in place for Squadron for the background and for all the speaking roles, it\u2019s really not much more to get it over to the PU as well, \u2019cause it\u2019s, basically the same system.<br /><br />CR: Yep, so, I would say not in 2.5 and, not \u2026 we\u2019re going to try and get a few things in for the next release \u2026 when the Star Marine one, but you know as we move on to widening out the Persistent Universe with procedural planets and there\u2019ll be some more landing locations we\u2019re going to get more variety in there, and then of course Squadron 42 is going to feel like a movie. Everyone\u2019s going to feel like their own cast member wandering around. It\u2019s all going to be very high quality and very cool. So, but yes we are very focused on that. So we\u2019re sort of feeling like we\u2019re coming over the hump of getting the tech kind of place where we\u2019ll be able to mix and match some stuff.

So honestly having doing this for quite a while the ambition behind this project and the commitment behind all the senior staff, Chris and Erin and the whole team, what they are able to pull together with the community. And also them wanting ... pushing boundaries technically on design, forging some new ground in my opinion, and others, is really what pulled us here to take a look and 18 months later here we are still working and pushing on things.In regards to the crowdfunding, honestly I don't think it has hurt at all. It's actually ... it gets us noticed from time to time obviously from the amount that we've crowdfunded and that draws people's attention. Which is great: it gives us a little bit more exposure and people know who we are. I do get question occasionally from candidates in regards to crowdfunding and what does that mean and the finances and so on. And I take the time to explain the detail of what we are doing day to day, month to month, midterm, long term, etc. So at most I would say it impacts is they want to know that things are secure if they are going to join us as a team ... because it's ... for these guys here we're hiring guys that are experienced and do this for a living so their career per se.", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 13", "source": "https://youtu.be/hp5AlLytcn0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Sao Saoldian", "published_at_timestamp": 1465251642}, {"objectID": "1e5215c2b4bc78_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The Prospector will come equipped with a light jump drive and light quantum drive and as it's a small ship, it will be able to travel through small jump points too.", "published_at_timestamp": 1461708000, "question": "Does the Prospector have a Quantum/Jump Drive and if so does it travel through small jump points?", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/15317-Q-A-MISC-Prospector-Part-I", "title": "Q&A: MISC Prospector - Part I", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "373674540", "question": "Given that spaceport security and armistice zones are meant to protect against griefing, would it be possible for a REALLY skilled or coordinated team of players to circumvent that security for nefarious purposes? Like say a handful of players roleplaying as violent extremists wants to stage a terrorist attack on Terra.", "answer": "That is an interesting question. I would say that there will be places that it will be almost impossible to do anything in, and then there will be places where there is security and armistice zones that if you're very determined and shut down security systems and do everything else, you could potentially cause some mayhem. And we'll gradually build that in such a way so that, like... probably doing a terrorist attack on Terra is gonna be out of the question but there may be some space stations and stuff that are kind of in between where maybe the security isn't as close to the power of the UEE, although it does have security and law enforcement. But a determined group of pirates could for a very short period of time cause some mayhem there. And it'll sort of be... we'll have a few of those, we'll have some safe places and then we'll have some completely unsafe places, and probably the risk-reward of all those places will be factored in.So you can probably make the most money in the unsafest areas, but of course there's a higher risk. In the safe areas you don't make as much money say trading or doing stuff but it's pretty safe and you're not likely to be attacked and if you are attacked there's a lot of backup and help that would show up. But we will make it so that for instance perhaps there could be a heist in a really, like... something like the Terra system for a cargo ship full of gold bullion or something, but that heist would have to be incredibly well planned. Think of it like the \"Heat\" heist, at the beginning of the film \"Heat\" with DeNiro and Pacino - where you would have to take down all the security systems, and do all this, and coordinate, and do it all at once, and you would have a window of a very small amount of time before you get away with the loot. Those kind of heists would be much more NPC AI driven in terms of what you're heisting. So maybe that shipment is something that's getting shipped from the Bank of Terra to somewhere else and someone else gets wind of it, and it's a criminal mission and then of course it could also be players and other AI that are also performing security. So that would be really hard to do but if you managed to do it the payoff would be really big. And of course you obviously have the risk of being a wanted person and all the rest of the stuff. We'll sort of build those aspects in. So we're going to have areas that we'll let that kind of gameplay work and, like I said, potentially there can be some less safe space stations. But there will definitely be some places that aren't just going to let you go in and destabilize. So like Terra or Earth - those kinds of one's will be pretty safe havens, and even when you go down onto them, to pass through the customs or immigration you'll have to cash in or pass in your weapons that you have. You can't take any weapons with you and they'll scan you going through and I think if you look at the ArcCorp you'll see the scanner setup and everything.So you have to land on the outside and pass through Customs and it's all sort of secure. And there'll be some places that don't have that I definitely think Nyx (or really Levski) will be less secure in the long run and that would have more \"law on the ground\" so to speak. So if you went in there and everyone took a gun and they started shooting, then maybe the local Police guys would come after you. But that's sort of the things we'll play with. So there'll definitely be places that will be safe and there'll be places that won't be safe.

Bengals are giant ships, so that's going to be something where you and a few friends in multiple crucibles are gonna want to roll over to that thing and start getting it fixed up. Because if you've managed to make one of those things dead in the water. That's no small amount of damage that you're going to have to fix up on this thing.Calix Reneau: Yeah the Crucible will be able to perform repair actions on things like the Bengal. They'll be able to repair hull damage, fix up breaches, do component repair in the field to a much greater degree than you could do by hand. However, the Crucible is limited in its cargo space and there are some components on the Bengal which are larger than the Crucible can carry. So, if one of those is broken beyond repair and must be replaced then you're going to have to find a way around that. It won't be a single Crucible job. I don't see that being the case for most of our larger ships, I think that you'll probably want to have two or three at minimum if you're going to be taking care of capital class ships.MS: Yeah, smaller ships like a Constellation, a single Crucible should be a good...CR: YeahMS: A good enough...CR: Easy.MS: ...to do a field refit on it. But the capital ship power plants and shield generators, these are massive room-sized installations. So, you're going to need something with a lot of bulk carrying capacity to get these bigger components over to those ships.

In Wing Commander it was the light ship. It ended up, when I was designing the Hornet and what we were doing, it felt more like a medium fighter because we had the turret on the middle of it and it just felt like it was a much more heavy hitting fighter than a light fighter would be. But that's essentially the history.A lot of the ships originally in Wing Commander were inspired by World War 2 ships and planes; war at sea and the all rest of that stuff. So you definitely see some nods to present day fighters or older fighters, whether it is the Hornet or other various ships that we have.

Will it be more like a traditional game from the past, where one would pick an answer A-D in a pop up window?", "answer": "So, we're trying something very different on SQ42 in terms of conversation. We've gone with the idea, you're in this whole first person world, first person Universe, and so the conversations you get into are from your point of view in first person. They're not limited like if you play something like Mass Effect or Dragon Age, where you click someone and you go into this conversation mode where, there's your character, and the character you're talking to, and it's traditional third person, and it cuts back and forth between what people are saying, and you select ABCDEF, and you have this wheel of conversation options. So one of the big concepts, or tenets, of SQ42, and we're going to bring it across to Star Citizen on the Persistent Universe side, is that the conversation should be fluid, like it is in real life, also the actions that you do, your body language, whether you keep eye contact, it's as important as what you say, so if you're, when you look up at someone, and they catch you and they go oh, hey, hi, and then maybe you can approach them and a conversation would start. And if they're talking to you and you turn away halfway through the conversation, they'll be like hey, what're you doing? And if you don't turn back they'll sort of stop or wander off. You turn back, and 'oh, as I was saying', and there'll be various options for you to influence it. So we have the moments where what we call your 'inner thoughts', there'll be a point where someone says 'what do you think of my flying', and your inner thought, and we're going to be using a technique that's very much like Sherlock, the BBC series, if you've seen it, sort of your thoughts sort of float out in the aether, the 3D space, and you'll hear it as you highlight ones, it'd be like, 'enh, nah, his flying really sucks' or 'Yeah, he's a pretty good flyer', and those are all sort of inner thought, and when you pick the one you like, 'oh no, you really kick ass flying, I really enjoy flying on your wing, you're the best wingman I've ever had. And you'll be able to sort of guide yourself through the conversation, so, between having the branches you can do, and it could be two, three four branches, the system will support all that, or you can even have contextual interactions like look around and, someone's boring you in a conversation and there's a glass of water, well, this is not something we have in SQ42, but an example of it would be, I can see that, I can, want to take a drink, that'll be one action, that'd be the use action, or there'd be 'take a drink' or 'throw water in person's face' and you could do that, and that would be potentially contextual if someone was insulting you in a conversation. So we're going to allow you to interact with things around you, items that could have context and meaning to a conversation, and also thoughts that you would have. And you can walk in and out, and you can move in and out, and it's all very fluid and in first person. It's all very different from a locked-off, ABCDEF kind of branching conversation you've seen before in RPGs and Adventure games, and I think it's going to be very cool. It's very fluid, it's about eye contact and paying attention. If you're doing stupid things like bouncing around and nodding your head, the other character's going to say hey, what're you doing, and pay attention, and just give up on you after a while, and they'll become more annoyed with you, and their approachability and friendliness to you will be decrease. It's really going to be about managing relationships, and who you decide to interact with, in SQ42, and make the friendships with, will affect things down the road and how they react to you. So I'm hoping that that sort of fluid, immersive conversation system will sort of pull you into the world, and also sort of if you spend time interacting with people, talking to people, getting to hear their backstories, getting to know what their hopes and dreams are, then later on if something happens, as it always does in singleplayer stories, maybe the person you'd been talking to, investing time in, gets killed, then it will be pretty emotionally impactful for you. So that's it, it's definitely something we've been thinking about for a long time, sort of the next stage for me of the stuff I want to do, so hopefully you guys will really enjoy it.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 61 (2015.07.27)", "source": "https://youtu.be/f8DX2VEeREY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Lee, Adama", "published_at_timestamp": 1438036231}, {"objectID": "267f65591f6b3_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "No promises yet, but we're looking at this!

All of the systems you've visited, all of the people you've interacted with, how many miles you've flown and all that. And the personal journal aspect of it is something we've touched on. It gets a little complicated dynamically creating emotional entries based off of content because we really want the players to have their own sense of personality. So, if the stuff that we're generating for them doesn't quite line up with how they're feeling then it might be a disconnect there so we still have to do more experimentation to figure out if something is going to be on that level. But I think probably the most exciting thing about it is that we have mobiGlas as a way to ground all of that information in lore by using the mobiGlas apps and there'll be a bunch of different ones to track all of the different sorts of information about your character. So, maybe all of the places you visit will be tracked in a travel app on your mobiGlas and stuff like that. So, theming it that way I think will help immersion a lot. For players.

I would say that we haven't really thought about that, so kind of a gut reaction to that is, that's an interesting concept. Normally I think we would...

And maybe sort of fudge the whole FTL side.But, uhh, I'll take this under consideration because does have some cool mechanics. It's just the downside is you don't really want to be stuck in a system when no one else is around who you can play around or train with, but these will all be things that we'll play with when we get the Persistent Universe up and running because I do like the idea of the game inside the game and then having it adhere to the rules of the universe.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 29.

But in general, we want it to have finite pools. So if someone gets to an asteroid field and it's got a really rich seam of minerals that are very valuable, they are a limited quantity, so people would mine them out, then maybe they would have to go off to find some other field or yield for that.So that's kind of the plan. The regeneration question's really just about, we're gonna be adding new systems, so there will be new places for people to find and explore, and obviously new minerals to harvest, so that probably should handle it, but if we run into a problem where everything's mined out right away and we've got nothing to mine, then of course we'd probably start regenerating some elements of it. But I'm hoping we can balance it.One of our goals is to actually run this full economy simulation or universe simulation with no players, with meta-AI that we've talked about, and with all these big macro elements like \"Here's an asteroid field and it has this kind of minerals,\" \"Here's a planet that produces this sort of stuff,\" and then just see how that works, runs, progresses.

Say me and this friend, this friend, and this friend, this is our little unit that's flying as a group, to let the game know that you're flying together.Then it will do things, like determining based on ping would be another criteria, but of course if you say \"I'm flying with this group,\" that takes priority over everything else.Then also what your preference is in terms of combat, whether you want to be doing PvP or want to be fighting NPCs in PvE. That depends on what sort of area of space you're in, but we're not going to match up someone who just wants to be doing PvE in a fairly safe area with someone who just wants to be doing hardcore PvP, 'cause that wouldn't necessarily be a lot of fun for the PvE side, and on the PvP side, there'll be plenty of opportunities to fight other people because we're making sure that there's a lot of benefit to being in the less regulated areas. More risk, more reward so to speak.All those criteria are factored in when we're doing the instancing. We decide, this group of players is coming from here to here, and they may intersect this other group. You run through the matchmaking criteria, and if you determine that they should see each other, you create an instance, you put the groups into it and let the conflict resolve itself, then they go back onto their journey.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 13 (2014.03.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/IIkeFs5xubw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Zengrinn", "published_at_timestamp": 1395698672}]
