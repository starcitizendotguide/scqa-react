Server meshing should help with this by reducing the number of locations each game server needs to stream in and simulate. Fewer locations will mean a much lower average entity count per server and the savings can be used to increase the number of players per server.<br/><br/>Client ping is dominated by distance from the server. We see many players choosing to play on regions in entirely different continents. Some of our game code is still client authoritative, which means that players with high ping can adversely affect the play experience for everyone else. There's not much we can do about this in the short term but it's something we want to improve on after Server Meshing is working.<br/><br/>Slow entity spawning can cause latency by delaying when entities stream in on clients. This can cause undesirable effects, such as locations not fully appearing until minutes after quantum traveling to a location, falling through floors after respawning at a location, ships taking a long time to appear at ASOP terminals, changing player loadout, etc. The bottlenecks with this are mostly on the server. First, entities don't get replicated to clients until they have been fully spawned on the server. Second, the server has a single spawn queue that it must process in order. Third, the more locations a server needs to stream in, the more spawning it has to do. To improve things, we have modified the server spawning code to make use of parallel spawn queues. Server meshing will also help, not only by cutting the load on spawn queues by reducing the number of locations a server has to stream in, but also because the Replication layer replicates entities to clients and servers simultaneously, allowing them to spawn in parallel.<br/><br/>We're still using some of our legacy persistent services, adequate as designed but known to have performance and scalability issues under our demands. This can result in long waits when fetching persistent data from the services in order to know what to spawn, such as spawning a ship from an ASOP terminal, examining an inventory, changing player loadout, etc. Since full persistent streaming and Server Meshing will both dramatically increase the amount of data we need to persist, we knew we needed to do something about this. This is why Benoit and his team at Turbulent have completely reinvented how we will persist data in the form of EntityGraph, which is a highly scalable service built on top of a highly scalable database that is optimized for exactly the kind of data operations we perform. On top of that, we're also developing the Replication layer, which acts like a highly scalable in-memory cache of the current state of all entities in a shard, eliminating the need for the majority of queries we've been sending to the legacy persistent services. That's right, it's going to be highly scalable services all the way down! <br/><br/>To help reduce/eliminate any additional latency the Replication layer may introduce, we're building it to be event-driven rather than on a tick rate like a traditional game server. This means that as packets come in, it will immediately process them and send out the response and/or forward the information to relevant clients and game servers. Once work on the initial version of the Replication layer is complete (the Hybrid service), we'll be doing an optimization pass to make sure it's as responsive as possible. And, although this is ultimately a decision for DevOps, we'll deploy them in the same data centers as the game servers themselves so the on-the-wire network latency due to the extra hop between the Replication layer and game server should be less than a millisecond. Oh, and did I mention the Replication layer will be highly scalable? That means if we detect the Replication layer causing latency hotspots in particular parts of the 'verse, we will be able to reconfigure it to remedy the problem.", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/18397-Server-Meshing-And-Persistent-Streaming-Q-A", "published_at": "2021-11-10", "published_at_timestamp": 1636502400, "title": "Server Meshing and Persistent Streaming Q&A", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "83f5b9f8efa16_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "As standardized cargo units are contained within the pods, they're treated as normal by cargo stations.", "published_at": "2021-06-23", "published_at_timestamp": 1624399200, "question": "Will it be possible to use the Railen's cargo pods at any cargo station?", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/18207-Q-A-GATAC-Railen", "title": "Q&A: GATAC Railen", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "d31876310cf53_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Can you tell us about reputation system and possible interaction with player orgs?

People want customization for their characters... it's a big one, I know people are actively working on the design doc and just the overall implementation but that character was one of our head scans as Gaige mentioned earlier on one of the questions on what our characters look like, that was one of the actors that we scanned and it's one of the first implementations of that character in the game-Gaige Hallman: Yeah, yeah..EKD: And we're excited cause at some point all of these characters we'd like them to be &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; in some form or fashion, right? &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; depending on if they fit or not into the lore or to the Universe, we can use them for both Squadron 42 and the Persistent Universe. So yeah, that was one of the ones that we wanted to use for that video and it was one of those starting to come online and we're all pretty excited about it.GH: We're basically have a whole line-up ready, we're perfecting one and then we're going to apply down the pipeline to the rest.EKD: That's going to be- it should hopefully simplify- it's like, if you work on any kind of creative content, the beginning baby percent, the beginning is just like the most intense that you're trying to figure out the most and after that it should just-GH: Yeah, yeah...EKD: ...fly, right? After that it's just small tweaks along the way as you learn new tech and new tools come online but you should be able to template mass apply and got 'em all going and you can start simplifying and then you can start seeing things quicker- come on quicker, play with 'em quicker and have fun with them quicker, in any game you make, you make a bunch of tools and those tools help you make everything else faster.GH: The pipeline..EKD: There you go, so that pipeline you get right the first time, or the second or third time and then you- it should sing, right?GH: Yeah.EKD: So thank you, we- I agree- I think that character looked great.GH: Hell yeah.", "published_at": "2016-05-16", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 10", "source": "https://youtu.be/PbTQWmXFuM0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Vacation", "published_at_timestamp": 1463434781}, {"objectID": "373674410", "question": "How are you or we will be handling this situation: we are exploring or hauling long freight and it is late, we log off.

Are the benefits of the improved ship pipeline process making their way into the landing zone pipeline? Is there even a pipeline for landing zones or are you waiting for procedural planet technology to finish before resuming major work on landing locations on planets?", "answer": "[Special Episode with answers from Erin Roberts]I think what you are asking here is ... when you say \"the landing zone pipeline\" that's our environment pipeline and yes, a lot of the ways we are building ships in terms of the way we do stuff, in terms of ... we come up with, say on the ship pipeline once we have nailed down what RSI looks like or so forth, then we have a lot of stuff we can use then ... that we can reuse that makes us be able to create the ships faster. And it really helps with the larger cap ships in the game because we've always got these huge spaces to create.On the landing zones, so absolutely. The way Ian Leyland, who's our ... is the Art Director in charge of Environments, he works out the UK office ... the whole way the pipeline is put together is in a very modular fashion but in a way that doesn't look repetitive. And so we are building these environments so they can be reused all over the place. So although right now you're seeing one or two things in terms of the PU, as we go forward we're going to be able to drop very complex and large, detailed areas in the game. Internal areas, inside space stations, on planets, and just everywhere you go and so forth. And that's the sort of stuff we'll be dropping into the game this year and a lot of that ... more stuff will be coming out.And we're already doing that on the Squadron 42 levels. Right now we have huge FPS levels in Squadron 42 using the basic, smallest kind of stuff. But yes that's what's going to happen.Now the procedural stuff as you mention will be coming online very soon which will tie in with the new streaming tech that we're using. And that will allow us, not only to have these environments, but also then place them within procedurally created, either planets or asteroids, and so forth. So we have ... create these huge environments and then we'll have specific areas which are created and molded to suit a purpose. So it's really cool. But then there will also be a lot of procedural stuff around it. But that stuff will be coming on this year so the answer is \"Yes, what we're doing on ship stuff is going to work for environments and you're going to see that hopefully very soon\".", "published_at": "2016-03-28", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 80", "source": "https://youtu.be/zvm1jW_Xp_8", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Lock Ostrie", "published_at_timestamp": 1459202407}, {"objectID": "373675220", "question": "I am curious as to how tri-monitor support will be handled. Most games don't support the full resolution of all three monitors. The picture is just stretched to the sides on the outer monitors. I would like to know if Star Citizen will render the picture for all three monitors without stretching to the sides, or will the game just stretch out like many others do?", "answer": "No, I think right now you can set, say if you have three monitor set up, three 1080p screens, you can get 5760 across by 1080p across the three screens and you are essentially just going to have a greater field of view.We haven't focused on that stretched screen stuff for support so we've got some things that we need to work out. For instance, when you are wearing a helmet, how much of that is getting occluded by a helmet versus not being occluded by a helmet because one of the things I wanted to do on the design side was to give you a sense of wearing heavy armour or a helmet: you get extra protection, you move slower, drains your stamina more but also you don't necessarily get as much visibility. I want a situation as you are playing the game that you will wear outfits appropriately for the situation like you do in the real world.For instance if you didn't have the restriction of visibility and bulkiness of an EVA suit when you are flying around, say in your Constellation, why wouldn't you always be in the EVA suit? In a game? Because then \"well what happens if we get attacked and there is depressurisation? Well then I'll live!\" But what we want you to do is say you go out and EVA and come back to your ship then you take your EVA suit and put it in the locker and take the helmet off because now you get a much wider field of view and you're not wearing a bulky EVA suit so can sit down in the pilot's seat and control things and do stuff like that.We're very much thinking about that tactile experience to create your behaviour that's appropriate. Then of course if you are getting attacked and there's a hull breach then you better rush and get your EVA suit on quickly before there's full decompression because if you're not wearing a suit and it decompresses then obviously that's not good for you.So in regards to that, on the multi-monitor setup, in terms or having the helmets we're just trying to think how much would it encroach. But actually again that would be a good illustration of why you would encourage people to maybe take their helmet off. Because if you took the helmet off you would get that full three monitor surround and you get it, obviously, in the chase view and all that and in the chase views but if you had a heavy helmet on maybe part of those monitors are obscured by that. Maybe not as much as they are now but that would be idea.So that is the goal. We may so some additional support in the multi-monitor view for you to have specific fields of view set up for that. I don't know if any of you remember the AMD demo we did, quite a few years ago, when they were announcing the last round of new chip technology, that was when we were first signing our partnership with them, and we actually showed the game in 5760 by 1080 and we changed around the view ratio in such a way to actually handle that format properly and not have it have that 'fisheye' stretched effect. And it was quite cool and we may do a bit more of that but that's a little further down on in terms of our priority list because there's a lot of other things that we're doing graphically and tweaking for before then.", "published_at": "2016-02-29", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 77", "source": "https://youtu.be/DFkTG9YungQ", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Sage_Ailig", "published_at_timestamp": 1456786477}, {"objectID": "373682510", "answer": "Steve Bender: So, how the character is going to move around and take cover. So, in Star Citizen our character does take cover, he does have actually cover animations set. So we have him come up to the cover object and when he gets there, he's using his idle animations, the weapon ends up raising, now it's not technically correct.Sean Tracy: Why is it not technically correct?SB: Because you raise your weapon up towards your head, so you can blow your brains out or something like this. For us to be able to allow the players to read what is happening it's important for design to be able to see that weapon, so we're bringing it up here and we're trying to be nice and safe. Then you can move back and forth across that cover object and around it and everything like this as well. Now when you hit an edge what happens is your character is going to then go from whatever that position is, to another, the weapon is going to move to another location. So say I'm going to my left hand side, to let me know that I'm at the corner of that cover object, and then I can peek out or if I go to aim I will then step out and come around the next corner and try to fire. What is the closest analog to what we're creating..?ST: That's tough huh?SB: Yeah it is.ST: None of the shooters, really that are out anyway, are third and first.SB: Yes.ST: With the expectation that you can really play in both. There's some that you can bounce out of, third, and see yourself.SB: There's a distinct connection within Star Citizen that doesn't exist in majority of first person shooters, where the third person and the first person assets are the same assets. That took a lot of, sort of, engineering figuring this out.ST: I like how you called engineering art 'chasing the tail'.SB: It actually came down to just a day in the Frankfurt.ST: I explained it on my sort of intro to you but I actually had a little explanation to the subscribers about Evo's one line change and then the little meme I did right after the fact, \"1000 man hours? I do in one line.\" But it was pretty cool, like it is interesting to talk about the first person/third person thing, and it does go totally in line with this only because we had tried for years back at CryTek to kind and get this right. This kind of started in Crysis 2, and like you know him far better than I do because you worked with Evo and other people at CryTek. It started in Crysis 2, you gave it a try.SB: Yeah we tried.ST: \"No this is not going to work.\"SB: Because the problem really was an engineering issue and a time issue, during Crysis 2 were making a lot of major changes to a lot of different systems. It just, there were certain promising things about it, but there were going to be issues with it, we could see those issues and we certainly found that we couldn't solve those issues within the time we had to ship the particular product. But changes that happened between Crysis 2 and Crysis 3, in the way that the third person character and the AI aimed, actually sort of set the ground-work for what we're doing here, because, you know, later last year we were looking at some of these issues, and connection issues, and we were trying to figure out why this wasn't working; why this other thing wasn't working.We saw the, we were like, the custom aim joint isn't being used properly. So once we got that working, and we were able to get the aim system working properly, it was a simple matter of tying back to the camera setup, now we had control of being able to make adjustments within first person, that made the same actual adjustments in third-person. So where you are pointing the gun in first person is exactly where he's pointing it in third person. Zero difference.ST: And there's just a huge disconnect with that right?SB: It was such a simple, it was one of those sort of answers where you just look at it and you're like, I remember standing there in the room and going, well can't just bla bla bla? And tie this to this? And it was like...ST: But you've been in game development enough years to know that, as soon as someone says \"Can't we just\" usually.. not, can't we just. So. In this case,SB: In this case, it was! In this case it was just like, huh. And Evo went back, he made the test, and totally fucking worked.ST: Yeah, which is super awesome, and I remember that we're the initial naive sort of implementation, literally take a camera, strap it onto a joint, and see what it looks like, and like it looked cool but you realised, I'm kinda getting sick, this doesn't really make sense, and then yeah.SB: So, what is the FPS combat going to feel like? So... Start Citizen, from a feeling standpoint, is going to be a little bit different than a lot of the games that you've typically played. It's not really a Call of Duty, but then again it's not a Battlefield 4, but then it's not an ARMA 3, but then it's not a Crysis 3.ST: Yeah, right.SB: We're taking sort of pieces of each of those, building something something new, and utilize what I like to call competitive analysis. So what I'll do is, we're playing something so, for instance we're working on the cover, and something is not feeling right, or it's not playing right, and I'm trying to explain what it is that I'm looking for, or what is wrong here. So what I'll do is I'll go get video from competing products out there, and I'll take those videos and I'll also take examples of videos of myself doing something, or animations that we've done, and really break 'em down and go, you see what they do here? You see what we're doing here? This thing isn't working here, right? And this is how we can fix that. I like what they're doing over here. So, it's kind of hard to sort of...ST: It's a nebulous question. How does it feel, how do you explain that. Now...SB: And that's going to change over time.ST: And maybe I'll give it a stab, because it's... it's somewhere, it's not a twitch shooter, it's not a Quake, it's not a Doom, it's not a fast shooter by any stretch of the imagination. Can you look around fast? Yeah, definitely you can look around fast. But it, things are not moving at that rate. It's just not that quick.SB: No, we want to promote ADSST: Exactly, Aiming down the sights. We want to promote some tactical movement, you want to promote teamplay, so, it's, it's definitely definitely somewhere between the Battlefields and ARMA. Where it's not full simulation but it's also not so simulation heavy that it becomes tiresome or frustrating.SB: There's some things you'll see you may go \"Oh hey I know that from say Crysis 3\". And things that we do with the character in the game because it is an engine game. It's a similar engine so even though we have heavily modified it.ST: Even this bit of it, which is the most fundamental sort of part of the CryEngine is the first person aspect of it or the first person character aspect of it. We've kind of re-did that, which probably doesn't make sense to a lot of people. The easiest thing to do would have been to say \"Alright just copy paste Crysis 3 and go to town\". Again with this game we wanted to be something new something unique and we're not afraid to give that a try right? I think that's an important point anyway.Maybe and to extend the question a tiny bit. I did one like, one of the examples, just to bring up one of the examples we were looking at.  Between Battlefield and our turning in place. So and still we're actually in a very real, realy shape that we have to fix our turn in place which is not as good as it could be in both our opinions I think. Or just our general turning. Battlefield has a really interesting system of you'll be standing there and your character is allowed to rotate almost 180 degrees before his feet do anything right? You recall this we were taking a look over a multiplayer server?SB: I remember you shooting me constantly as we were testing.ST: Yeah and then I was prone and you shot me in the face and you teabagged me sometimes it was... I remember this too! So we were taking a look at it what happens is with our game right now in Star Citizen in what like 30 degrees or something like this? I can't remember what the foot turn start is. We've got different animations for 0-45, 45-90 and then 90 plus I think or I might have gotten that wrong, 30, 45 whatever.Basically as soon as you're outside of that rotation we start adjusting your feet so that you can align to that new position now. I kind of like the way that Battlefield does it because you don't get a lot of this foot shuffling which a lot of people are not liking with our game right now cause one there's a bug where you can get stuck shuffling. But mostly because and again this came from other bugs with the camera, you could see yourself shuffling and you don't really see that anymore with the fixes that have gone in.It does almost make a lot more sense when you're holding a weapon you wouldn't just rotate 30 degrees and then start doing that you would probably go just about as far as you can go and then you would make that rotation so it's things like that just to wrap an example into that.SB: Yeah we're taking to that exact like originally it was 30 degrees off center. Now we're going okay well ... For instance when we're in relaxed and we're looking, I can go like this, I can go like this, I can go like this and now this is ... I can go all the way over here, but naturally if I'm you're here from me, I'm just going to, at this point I'm going to start to rotate. So it's a balancing act between the no weapon. So when you're relaxed, that behavior is a little bit different and the having the weapon so we want to remove a lot of that ticky ticky ticky ticky ticky coming across, but we also want to make sure that when I am aiming and I'm gonna go aim this way that I as I come this direction, right about here ... So it's maybe 60 degrees or so, I'm going to attempt to re-orientate.ST: Right.SB: That way we're still keeping the feeling of realism in the characters poses when he's firing and stuff like that, but we're not getting that ticky ticky ticky.ST: Right, right right, perfect. So hopefully, daz that was enough info there to give an idea of what we think it's gonna feel like. Of course we have the way that Chris wants it to feel, the way that we want it to feel which are all pretty much in line so I think we'll get there soon.SB: So let's go to BigDave.ST: I like that BigDave question.SB: Yeah.", "published_at": "2016-02-08", "published_at_timestamp": 1454972976, "question": "I would like to know how FPS combat will feel when done.

Is it going to be rather lean or will it be more taxing? For example, back in UT99 days, 90KB upload could actually serve over 32 players. Nowadays games like ARK, on the same bandwidth, you could maybe host only 8-10 at best. MMOs also, originally worked with 56k lines but then started requiring SDL or higher connections. Where do you see Star Citizen going?", "answer": "Our plan is to make the netcode in Star Citizen as good as we possible can and as good as anyone else's out there. To be honest most of the challenge at the moment isn't bandwidth in terms of how much data were pushing up or down the pipe, although that obviously when you have a big solar system with lots of people doing things and lots of NPC's doing things can definitely get saturated.Although we have made some pretty good improvements with something that's called the Dead Reckoning system which essentially just means that you don't send data like say positional update data unless something has changed. If something is just moving at a constant speed in a certain direction, once you've established the direction and the speed, you need to not send anymore data unless something changes, so basically you change the deltas and states. So not necessarily the deltas and position because you can already calculate position based on a fixed velocity and direction, it's really the deltas and states. So if something changes in the delta and state then you communicate it.That's really the fundamentals of the Dead Reckoning system which is what we have on our network bandwidth side and we're sort of right now actually in the middle of a refactor on the system to have a much more sophisticated serializing and aspect system that integrates much simpler and better with the game code on a scalability basis because unfortunately CryEngine and this is pretty much true with every engine out there like Unreal and Unity is you don't buy off the shelf engines that are really thinking about scaling for millions of players and thousands of concurrent players. They're built for \"We need a 16 player or 32 multiplayer match.\" That has very different demands to what we'll need in Star Citizen and the Persistent Universe.So we're refactoring things to scale thing better. Doing things like putting the network communication messaging into a thread doing a better job of it. It is kinda threaded already in CryEngine, but we want to do a better job at it. So that's all stuff we're doing, but the really big challenge is the updating of these objects, but not necessarily so much the network bandwidth, but the amount of CPU time it takes to simulate and update the objects and obviously with GPU time to render them.When you have for example, I think people play 2.1 or 2.0 and if everyone spawns into the game and they all go to one area, well the performance is much better there than if they all went to 6 different areas and 6 different sets of AI all spawn, because what's happening on the server is it's running all those AI and all those players and all these different locations. It actually has a very heavy update loop and then why the game can slow down is now the server is now dropping down to 10 frames per second instead of what we want it to be, 30 frames per second, it's sending less frequent messages to the client and now the client feels like it's sluggish because it's not getting enough update or things are rubberbanding.So there's a lot of making the updates more efficient, obviously making the rendering better, streamlining the netcode to really only send things that are deltas and making sure it's like well threaded in terms of communication and making sure there's good sync points within the update. Those are all the things we are doing because we need to scale it for the size we want. I think we'll probably try to utilize as much bandwidth as we want, but up until now it's been less about bandwidth assuming you have a got a proper broadband connection and much more about server performance and client performance.So we're focusing on things that will improve that and we'll be back to optimize the data packages we're sending over the network because maybe they need to be smaller so we can get more information across. That's some of the process, but the goal will be to have something that will pass. We're working pretty hard towards that and there's a lot of pretty talented folks focusing on that.

So if you keep them in your hangar where other than the fact that you may keep something in your hangar for a couple of years and now it's an outdated model. We're not really going to have it deteriorate there. But if you take it out on missions, it's flying, stuff is getting inside combat, then it will have some level of sort of deterioration. We've got a whole sort of blend layer setup for wear and tear. So over time you'll start to see more wear and tear and then you can bring it into a repair shop or so on and pay them some credits and they will sort of buff it back out to new.

Have you asked CR to send you into orbit for, you know... research? :)", "answer": "Elwin Bachiller: We joke about it sometimes... about getting sent into orbit. I actually want to do the \"vomit comet\" - the parabolic flight - that would be super cool.So, coming up with a cool design...Lance Powell: Can I just stop you for 2 seconds and just join me in this...[Looks into the camera]CR... we want to go to space. For research.EB: For research.LP: For research.EB: So, the design question - I think in a previous 10 for the Artists we talked about this a little bit. We tend to start off with real life examples of what it is that we are trying to achieve. So, if a spaceship is designed to accomplish a specific goal - whatever that might be, transporting fuel, dogfighting...LP: Space AAA.EB: Space AAA. A mining ship... whatever it is. We collect as many references for the actual function before we even start figuring out how we're going to design the aesthetics of the ship. So, we start off with function and then we go ahead and build the design around it. The rest of that comes from the style guides that we've already put in place for the manufacturers. So, if you have an Aegis ship which is supposed to be a mining vessel - well, the Reclaimer is actually not a mining vessel. But, as an example let's assume there was an Aegis ship that was a mining vessel. We would start off with mining equipment as references, and then we'd go ahead and apply the Aegis aesthetic on top of that. So we'd have smooth curves. We'd have like... space shuttling panelling, since that's part of the look for them, and we'd probably have the intakes on the top since that's like an Aegis thing. So, we have style guides which define some of the elements that these ships need to have and that's kind of how we arrive at the look. And we'll do variations of that and pick the coolest one.LP: Right. I think just to add some colour to that... the game takes place in the year 2900 [not entirely accurate... 2945] and one of the things we kick around a lot, more as a form of entertainment to new people who come on - myself included - the year 2900 is just a date that works for the story. It doesn't have practical implications on how design is going to work in the future. And a good example of that would be... there is some technology that is being worked on today and that technology far outshoots anything we're planning for Star Citizen 900 years later.So, the concept that we've been working with on the art side, specifically with the Persistent Universe and with some of the concept art, instead of people going... \"Well, in 900 years everything is going to be a hologram and you may have a teleporter and your dog is going to be made out of nanobots and they'll be able to freeform and reform.\" Instead of all that stuff, we're saying... you can take a look at Rome as an example and 2000 years ago Rome was a dominant culture on the planet. They were hundreds of years ahead of almost every other culture and then they had the plaques and wars and they were sacked several times by the Gauls and basically it sent them back into the stone age. So, 900 years is really... what does it mean? You look at Star Wars is at 900 years... you look at Star Trek is at 300 years. So, it's our timeline and how we choose to tell the story.And to your point about the ships: I think that the ships take a nod from a lot of the cultural and creative influences that we grew up with. So, you're always going to see something that inspired us at some point in time slowly work its way into some of our designs because that's what we grew up with - that's what we really enjoy. More importantly, it's also what CR's tastes are - it's right in line with the stuff that we grew up with.I think the aesthetics kind of lends itself to something we've seen and re-envisioned, more than something that we've never seen because we can't imagine what stuff is going to look like 900 years from now.", "published_at": "2015-05-18", "title": "10 for the Artists: Episode 02 (2015.05.18)", "source": "https://youtu.be/shxj7XXKgr4", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Notable Joe", "published_at_timestamp": 1431986585}, {"objectID": "34870727c9ff8_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Yes.

We're working on PBR shaders for the character models, and actually that particular build doesn't have the ship damage shader into the characters. But the plan is to have all of that in down the track, including non-functioning or missing limbs unable to be used etc. It won't all debut with the 1.0 of the FPS, but that's all stuff you can expect to come in for realism and immersion.", "published_at": "2015-03-30", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 58 (2015.03.30)", "source": "https://youtu.be/joKjDdKcOMQ", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Graxas", "published_at_timestamp": 1427752772}, {"objectID": "373679730", "answer": "Calix Reneau: Yes. Shield behavours are getting a whole pass, and one of those is setting up your shields to being better at handling splash damage vs direct damage, or energy vs particle etc. These are all things that will directly affect it. That said, missiles exploding on impact are only if they're strike missiles, proximity missiles will explode if they get close enough and start to lose range, so depends on the missile.Dan Tracey: And of course in future patches, you'll see different weapon types and explosion types, so keep checking back and see how the new guns or ammunition change their damage based on how shields are configured etc. You might see a new type of gun in 1.1 that has interesting effects too....", "published_at": "2015-02-09", "published_at_timestamp": 1423522808, "question": "Given that as described in Bug Smashers, missile explosive damage in being absorbed by the shields to various degrees as the weapon is apparently activating on contact with the shield, does this mean that the damage from explosive cannon rounds is or will be mitigated by the shields also?", "source": "https://youtu.be/eb01zlo_MvM", "title": "10 for the Designers: Episode 01 (2015.02.09)", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Spike OZ", "time": "13m10s"}, {"objectID": "373678920", "question": "Will planets have varying gravity? If I visit a planet with greater, or less gravity than that of Earth, will it affect how I walk on it? Will it slow me down, or let me jump higher? How exactly will this affect combat?", "answer": "I'm pretty sure we're gonna use gravity. I mean, we haven't explicitly sort of designed \"oh this planet's got half gravity, this planet's got full gravity,\" but I'm pretty sure we will because it's a pretty big gameplay element that we're building for the first person shooter aspect, and it's certainly very prominent in use in space - so on space stations, asteroid bases, boarding other ships. I mean there's gonna be gameplay where you can turn off gravity, turn on gravity, and that will affect you differently. And so we would be kind of silly not to use all the code and support that we're building for that down on some planets. So you could potentially be on a big, heavy gravity planet, and some ones would be, you know, like the moon - much lighter gravity. So I would assume that we would probably do something like that in a couple of places. I mean most places will probably be more like Earth-like gravity, just for, you know, familiarity. But occasionally we would definitely have places like, you know maybe there's a moon outpost or something, and that would have lower gravity, and then that would just rely on all the FPS zero-gravity, or low-gravity mechanics that we're building right now in the FPS.", "published_at": "2014-09-08", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 36 (2014.09.08)", "source": "https://youtu.be/a7GBgc4GxAQ", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "CaptainRupnow", "published_at_timestamp": 1410213823}, {"objectID": "373683320", "question": "I know I would fly every ship very differently and while I know you are adding custom key bindings to Arena Commander soon; I was wondering whether or not you plan to allow us to save certain configurations to different ships instead of having to change the layout every time with switch?", "answer": "So, that's actually a pretty good suggestion. We definitely working on the whole custom keybinding stuff, and we'll let you save that off to a profile. So what you really want to do there is have a profile that could be bound to a ship, so that would just be an extra level of customization that could happen there. I certainly think we'll let you save off several profiles, and then you could easily reload the bindings for, you know, your Constellation profile, or your Aurora profile. And then the next level would be to automate that, so I think that's a good suggestion... I'm not sure that's gonna be there on day 1, but longer term I think we possibly would consider doing that, because that would make things easier for people who like to have a different setup for different ships.", "published_at": "2014-07-21", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 30.

You don't have an instance that runs at the same time as planet side in space.You never know what we may do in the future, currently that wouldn't be part of the plan, but it is a cool idea.", "published_at": "2014-06-02", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 23.
