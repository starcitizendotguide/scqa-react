It began extracting resources from the Pyro system in 2493, shortly after receiving the green light from the United Nations of Earth (UNE). The profits from this venture allowed the company to quickly expand its operations in Pyro, constructing countless bases and space stations throughout the system.

Rather than using heat to alter the nutrient bioavailability of ingredients as is traditionally done by Humans, Xi\u2019an utilize aging and fermentation. Xi\u2019an cannot digest the majority of fresh fare and are intolerant of hot or cold meals. Level of aging, type of fermentation, strength of flavor, and texture are the most important aspects of Xi\u2019an food preparation. Humans consider Xi\u2019an food to be harshly flavored.</p><br/><h1>History</h1><br/><p>The first indications of cultivated Xi\u2019an cuisine arose when Xi\u2019an established permanent homesteads. Before this time, they traveled in nomadic family groups, scouring the landscape for sustenance while protecting one another from predators. The hot, humid environment of their homeworld was conducive to rapid decay of potential food sources. Food with rich microbiomes such as carrion and rotted leaves made up the bulk of the early Xi\u2019an diet. Predators kept them on the move. It wasn\u2019t until agriculture and animal husbandry were discovered that families were able to create long-term settlements fortified against natural predators, allowing them time and space to experiment with meal preparation techniques.</p><br/><p>Major characteristics of contemporary Xi\u2019an cuisine soon emerged. Bacteria, molds, yeasts, and spices that enhanced food with intense textural sensations and robust flavors were sought after and cultivated. Aged eggs collected from abandoned <em>s.\u0101oth</em> nests became so popular that the lizard was domesticated. Meat harvested from animals allowed to die of natural causes became famous among prosperous families for being more tender and flavorful than meat from slaughtered animals; this attitude persists among Xi\u2019an chefs today. Meat that was heavily spiced, left to age in the sun until soft and pungent, and served alongside strips of the leafy vegetable<em> nga.u\u2019ii\u2019y\u0113l</em> became a favorite dish.</p><br/><p>The discovery of fermentation revolutionized the Xi\u2019an diet. Plants they couldn\u2019t previously digest, such as grain <em>pai'pun</em> and legume <em>pai\u2019lio</em>, became staples of their new diet. Vessels used for fermentation doubled as long-term food stores, allowing families to stockpile their resources and expand beyond homesteads into state-like powers called Houses. Demand for spice and other food additives opened trade routes between distant locations. As Houses continued to grow, so did the Xi\u2019an palate.</p><br/><h1>Flavor and Texture</h1><br/><p>Every Xi\u2019an dish is constructed to balance texture with intensity of flavor. 13 favorable tastes, 13 favorable textures, and 13 unfavorable qualities were identified by members of House Uai\u2019i in their treatise <em>Three Leaves of Flavor</em>. These were compiled into a text and sold to traders en route to other Houses. The treatise was hugely influential to Xi\u2019an cuisine as an art. Even today, the ideal <em>y.iy\u2019atin\u2019tang</em> (multitextured) meal described in the treatise remains the end goal for Xi\u2019an chefs.</p><br/><h1>Fermentation and Aging</h1><br/><p>Fermentation is the foundation of the Xi\u2019an diet. Ingredients are typically cut into large pieces, then seasoned and placed inside a <em>tyixa\u2019yetui</em> (fermentation vessel). The vessel is then placed inside the <em>nyuntui</em> (fermentation chamber), a temperature-controlled room with deeply grooved walls inoculated with colonies of yeast, mold, and bacteria. These <em>tya e Yii\u2019ua</em> (House strains), unique to each House and closely guarded, are cultivated over generations. At first, the vessels are left open to invite the strains into the process. The vessels are then sealed, usually for months, before being opened again, cut into bite-sized pieces, placed on large dishes, and served alongside other meals, most often at room temperature (30 C).</p><br/><p>Food that isn\u2019t fermented is aged via air-curing, sun-ripening, drying, controlled rot, the addition of micro-organisms, or other methods. If a dish has been prepared well, a Xi\u2019an might say that it is \u201cproperly rotted.\u201d A bland dish might be described as \u201clacking rot.\u201d This applies to beverages as well. One popular drink, <em>chui.y\u2019o\u2019sui</em>, is made from the aged blood of various animals and mixed with complimentary vinegars. Even purified water would be considered unpalatable to Xi\u2019an; on Xi\u2019an worlds, drinking water is enhanced with minerals and various micro-organisms for health and flavor.</p><br/><h1>Condiments</h1><br/><p>Xi\u2019an eat only a few times per week. Shared meals are considered a big family affair. Even Xi\u2019an who are traveling alone will choose to share tables with strangers at restaurants. At the center of a communal table filled with various dishes one can always find a <em>thauil</em> (condiments platter) loaded with seasonings and dressings that will impart various favorable flavors on one\u2019s food, such as <em>ki.s\u2019a</em> (ammoniac; chemical; bitter), <em>ngi\u2019pi</em> (itching; buzzing; pain), or <em>p.\u016bnt.a</em> (alcoholic, warming). Xi\u2019an do not experience intoxication from consuming alcohol, and some more forward-leaning Xi\u2019an restaurateurs on Oya III have added Human-influenced alcoholic seasonings to their menus.</p><br/><h1>Modern Trends</h1><br/><p>Since the thawing of tensions between the United Empire of Earth and the Xi\u2019an Empire (SaoXy'an), Xi\u2019an have begun to explore Human styles of cooking. Dishes such as shiokara, blue cheeses, and lutefisk have been unreservedly embraced by Xi\u2019an chefs. Cold-brewed pu-erh tea has made waves due to its similarity to <em>hai\u2019pe</em>, a beverage steeped in sunlight from the leaves of a tropical pine tree. The beverage rotik is similarly popular among adventurously-minded Xi\u2019an. This is especially notable because <em>nginguichui</em> (milky; creamy; like animal milk) has been considered an unfavorable food quality for hundreds of <em>millennia</em>. However, hot and cold food, also ill-regarded in the Xi\u2019an tradition, seems unlikely to catch on.", "title": "Galactapedia: Xi'an Cuisine", "id": "V3qvm96LeA", "slug": "xian-cuisine", "template": "ImageCaptionOnly", "type": "galactapedia", "published_at": "2024-10-25", "published_at_timestamp": 1729823822}, {"objectID": "V3GP3rrD4j-squadron-118", "answer": "The 118th Fighter Squadron (Squadron 118, the \"Hare Triggers\")  is an active United Empire of Earth (UEE) Navy unit.

A script that has yet to be deciphered is engraved upon it on one side. It was most likely sculpted by the original inhabitants of Terra, who disappeared under unknown circumstances millennia before Human colonization. In the years since it was discovered in 2832, the fragment has been the focus of debate among archaeologists, linguists, and the scientific community.</p><br/><h1>Description</h1><br/><p>The Vasli Fragment is a large granodiorite stone bearing an inscription on the face. The stone is dark grey in tint, with yellow crystalline streaks and swirls. The front surface is polished with an archaic script deeply incised upon it. A splash of silver and spots of polished yellow agate coat the left-side of the fragment, obscuring some of the text. The sides of the stone are smoothed from water erosion and show evidence of having been attached to a larger monument at some point, although no other fragments have ever been discovered.</p><br/><h1>Discovery</h1><br/><p>In the Summer of 2832, the University of Earth at Australia (UEA) conducted an archaeological expedition to Zaffre Bay near Prime on Terra. The fragment was discovered around 150 km from the city, amid a haul of otherwise unremarkable debris. The leader of the expedition, Dr. Kleina Vasli, identified the markings on the stone as an inscription in an unknown language that she later named Terran A.</p><br/><p>The fragment was taken to the Quasi Institute for Xenological Studies (QIXS) for analysis. Dr. Vasli and the linguists at QIXS connected the script to markers found at the Quasi ruins. This was the first time substantial writing samples had been discovered from the civilization that once inhabited Terra (nicknamed \"Atlanteans\" in popular culture). Over the next two years, linguists attempted to decipher the script but were unable to crack it.</p><br/><h1>From Earth to Terran Possession</h1><br/><p>In 2834, Dr. Vasli brought the fragment back with her to the UEA for further study. This decision was lambasted by the Terran academic community; many Terrans felt that the stone should remain where it was discovered. Upon Dr. Vasli\u2019s retirement in 2859, the UEA donated the stone to the Museum of Earth (MOE). It remained on display there for 75 years while the Terran government continually submitted requests for its repatriation.</p><br/><p>The Vasli Fragment was finally returned in 2934. To commemorate this event, the Puglisi Collection commissioned Dr. Amelia Kesh, head chair of the Prime Linguistics Institute, and master sculptor Shinji Torusa to construct an exact copy of the Fragment. Replicas were made available for public sale in 2945.</p><br/><h1>In Popular Culture</h1><br/><p>While the purpose of the Vasli Fragment is still unclear, it has been adopted by several movements in popular culture: Terran separatists use it as a symbol of their desire to break away from the United Empire of Earth, while Transitionalists tout the fragment as evidence that Humanity has many more things left to discover.

So an interdiction device will be used to pull someone out of quantum travel which will be popular with pirates of course. One of the problems when creating the device was where does it eject the person in quantum? At first they had it do it right where they were, but then it made distress beacons useless because the pirates would have already killed the person. Then they thought they would increase the distance by 5-10 miles and so it takes time and allows them to get reinforcements, but then the person would just spool up their quantum drive after 30 seconds to a minute to get away. So what they decided on an area of effect mechanic where the person who initiates the interdiction field will determine how much power to use and then that determines the range of the interdiction device is and also the shape of the curve, the shape of the curve will dictate the probability of where you'll end up. You won't always fall in the centre, you'll always want to fall in the fringe, but it depends on the shape of the curve. As you push that curve farther in, you're more likely to have people fall in that area, but that means they can re-engage their quantum engines at a much less significant distance so the person who initiates the drive will want to find the sweet spot. The downside to cranking up the power is it draws more attention to yourself such as security forces, so making the field smaller and more precise means less people get caught, but you're less likely to get detected.", "published_at": "2016-11-29", "title": "Star Citizen: November Subscriber's Town Hall", "source": "https://youtu.be/qKH1B1p9TgM", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "time": "10m17s", "published_at_timestamp": 1480448849}, {"objectID": "373672590", "question": "Friendly fire modes in Star Marine?", "answer": "They need to have system to be able to kick players and that there's proper feedback to know who's your team and not at a quick glance, they're working on indicators right now to enable that.

And I said I'd met Travis in a, I think I said, Serbian prison camp: he took a knife for me once and I've been indebted to him ever since.KT: Ah.DV: It was said, just, offhandedly there was no intention ... I could have said a Japanese prison camp or an Antarctic prison camp. It didn't matter, the joke was regarding the prison camp itself that he took a knife for me once and I've been indebted to him ever since. That was the joke but because I used a certain countries reference that does have a history of particular turmoil a lot of viewers from that region were really upset.

So I guess I'm sort of debating about this, because I'm not sure you'd want to be flying and have an asteroid, you know, 10,000 asteroids on your radar because that would be a lot of noise.  I think we'd definitely have the bigger, like an asteroid over a certain size, or an asteroid base would show up on it, and ship chunks, but basically the system already does that because everything in space is what you'd call an entity.  So a spaceship is an entity, an asteroid is an entity, a projectile is an entity, a floating pilot would be an entity.  So it's really about filtering out what you want to see.  Right now, we filter out everything but the spaceships and the missiles, but we could have modes where you know, you might want to say \"I'm just looking for downed pilots,\" or \"I'm looking for reclaimed debris\", and it wouldn't be too hard for us to actually do.   I think at some point we'd have those scanners put in there, say for instance if you're in the Reclaimer and you're looking for debris, you'd probably have a scanner that would look for debris areas.  Now maybe it won't give you a location of every piece of debris, because that would be too much, but it would say, there's a good concentration of debris over here, so maybe this is a good place to go reclaim some debris.  So I guess the answer is, yes we can do it.  We can do it right now.  The only reason we haven't done it yet is because we've been combat focused in Arena Commander and obviously you care more about other spaceships and missiles.  It's really about filtering out what you see and what you don't see.  The question mark with it is say with an asteroid field, you probably don't want to see every asteroid because that'd be too much, so set a filter to have it only be asteroids over a certain size or whatever it would be or only asteroids so close to you would be another way of doing it.", "published_at": "2015-09-14", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 66", "source": "https://youtu.be/VGTj2iWkS-8", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "RustySpoork", "published_at_timestamp": 1442269621}, {"objectID": "1036d9d692af19_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "This is going to depend on the fighter!

So, and this will be in the release that's coming out very shortly you'll be able to do that (what we call internally \"release 13\"). But the way we're thinking, because there's two basic requests... 1) People want to be able to have the full control and they want to go forwards and backwards, left, right, up and down, and also roll, and have to sort of additive. So, right now if you went into decoupled mode you can strafe left or right but it always goes back to the neutral position. And so what we're gonna change it around to is that you can go into the decoupled mode, and basically that's putting you into the 6DOF mode, and in that mode you can either change your rotation OR you can do additive motion - so you can basically go left or right, forward or back, up and down, as well as doing the roll and everything else, but it's not taking you back to neutral. So if you thrust right 5 times, you keep going right until you thrust left 5 times to cancel it out - which is sort of true 6DOF. On top of that, we're also going to be adding the option in standard IFCS to be able to strafe left, right, up and down as you're flying around. So you'll basically have the best of both worlds. You'll have the full control of being able to spin, go left, right, up and down in your ship and not ever go neutral, so you can sort of do that... or when you're flying around on the IFCS doing a turn, you'll also have the ability to give you some side thrust or whatever. So like if you're going head-on-head and people want to strafe you can maybe burst out without having to leave the IFCS mode, and then that will bring you back to your path before. So it allows more maneuvering and more options than we had before, and for us that sort of felt like that was the best option how to get the 6DOF to work in our system, because it's not particularly viable to have IFCS and 6DOF working together because they basically fight against each other 'cause IFCS is trying to fly you a certain way. So it certainly can... you can tell the IFCS system, \"oh I wanna go left, or I wanna go right for a bit,\" but then IFCS is always wanting to get you back to a certain heading and velocity.So the way we look at it is we're going to add strafe ability to the normal flight mode, and then when you go into decoupled mode that's really your 6DOF mode, and so the moving around laterally, your vector changes are all additive now so they won't be going back to neutral. And then obviously you can do your orientation changes. I think hopefully that will satisfy a lot of the people out there.And then longer-term, in terms of how we're gonna do it, I think it's too early to say, but the kinda concept was that on the more basic ships you had a basic IFCS system - maybe you don't even have all these functionality or features - it just sort of flies in a very simple manner. But then if you have a more complicated one then you can get more of these features enabled, and maybe the reaction times are better, and maybe there's more customization on the more expensive ones. Because it would be kind of nice to different flight modules you can program into, so, you know, there's a sort of expensive customize-able one that really allows you to tweak everything that you want to do. That's still in the process of figuring out exactly how we're going to do that. Not in terms of how technically we do it, because it's pretty easy 'cause the features are all there - it's just a matter of what you turn on and off. It's more about like how best to do it in the items and then provide the interface for the player.", "published_at": "2014-08-18", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 34 (2014.08.18)", "source": "https://youtu.be/y4wAP1fWe8c", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Logical Chimp", "published_at_timestamp": 1408399954}, {"objectID": "373684830", "question": "Are NPCs a finite figure in the galaxy? Could it be possible that entire races could be wiped out?Or are the NPC stock refilled to maintain set numbers as they are killed?", "answer": "The population count is driven by the economy too, so as a place becomes more prosperous it will attract more people to move there, or because it's doing well, you would assume that the population there would be growing. Then other places the population would be contracting because that part of the galaxy's not doing so well or is getting involved in battles or wars.So the numbers of NPCs in the galaxy will probably fluctuate a certain amount, but probably not enough that you'll be able to see a material difference in the overall galaxy. Probably in local systems, you'll appreciate whether this system's booming and there's a lot more people there, or it's not doing very well and there's less people there. And I'm not so sure that you could wipe out an entire race.If we did that, that would be more of a controlled, game master event, but right now we have no plans for that. So I wouldn't say that the NPC stocks are a set number that we always refill to, we let it be organic, but like I said, it will probably fluctuate around a mean.", "published_at": "2014-04-14", "title": "10 for the Chairman - Episode 16 .

Will it have space ports I can land at, space stations to dock at, etc? Will they be alien, or do they have the same stores as Human worlds?", "answer": "So the answer is yes, we definitely will have spaceports. We'll have, not the entire Banu area will be mapped out, although down the road it probably will be. But we'll definitely have Banu worlds you can visit, you can land at, and they'll probably have some space stations. And yes, they will be different in architecture. We're sort of designing that on the Xi'an right now, we're starting to do it on the Banu. You can see the Banu trader is a sort of different look and feel than the Human ships. We'll be showing you some Xi'an stuff pretty soon that will be very different look and feel than the Human ships too. We've also got some Xi'an architecture and planet stuff that we've been working on which is very different from Human and we quite like it. We're trying to make each one of the races have a very distinct feel and personality so you sort of feel: \"Ok, here I'm in Human space, I'm in Banu space, I'm in Xi'an space.\" So that's a long-winded version of yes.", "published_at": "2014-02-10", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 07 (2014.02.10)", "source": "https://youtu.be/-y0GQV_Bx4U", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Perry the Cynic", "published_at_timestamp": 1392073473}]
