The holiday involves public festivals adorned with decorations in black and green and private gatherings convened to remember and honor the dead. Celebrants dress up as people who have passed away or in other costumes and swap scary stories, especially pertaining to mysterious incidents in space. It is seen by Humans as a day that gives equal weight to the joy of life and the macabre.</p><br/><h1>The Vara</h1><br/><p>The holiday first originated around 27 October 2557 after the disappearance of the <em>Vara</em>, an exploration vessel orbiting the second planet in the then-recently discovered Hades system. Communications from the <em>Vara</em> to the Rhetor system stopped early in the morning, after captain Tisiphone Heptane sent her initial impressions of the ruined alien cities. Systems on board ceased transmitting ship status reports a few hours later. Though search and rescue teams were dispatched the next day, the <em>Vara</em> and her crew were nowhere to be found. No wreckage or remains were ever located.</p><br/><h1>Origin and Development</h1><br/><p>In the years following this disappearance, rumors spread among haulers and travelers that something malevolent lurked in the Hades system. People began to avoid flying through it on the anniversary of the Vara\u2019s demise because on that day, the ship and her crew would supposedly return from the dead and haunt the system. Stories would vary about what would happen to those who encountered the ship but all of them touched on fears surrounding space travel: sometimes the undead crew would secretly board passing vessels to sabotage vital systems; other stories had them haunt the living until they went insane and vented their own ship; in some, scavengers would happen across an abandoned spacecraft, only for the frozen bodies aboard to come alive at the worst possible moment. Horror stories like these remain a major part of Day of the Vara.</p><br/><p>One of the lighter tales that became popular involved a protagonist who disguised themselves as a <em>Vara</em> crew member, which inspired others to dress as the deceased to protect themselves from bad luck in space travel. Members of Terra\u2019s (Terra III) counterculture picked up on the superstition and threw the first official Day of the Vara event on 27 October 2593. Many attendees dressed as ImperatorIvar Messer I, who had died in 2592, ostensibly to ward off evil. Songs celebrating Messer\u2019s demise that circulated among the crows that night indicated otherwise. Deacon Messer II and the UEE government spun the footage as support for the government and encouraged more Day of the Vara celebrations in 2594, describing it as a way to \"fondly remember those who have been lost.\" The campaign was successful; today, the holiday is primarily seen as a day to dress up as and honor those who have passed. It was officially established as an annual holiday in 2595.</p><br/><h1>Celebration and Traditions</h1><br/><p>In addition to wearing costumes, remembering dead loved ones, and swapping scary stories, revelers practice traditions adapted from various other festivals that celebrate the dead, such as indulging in food and drink like spirit cakes and iced wine, lighting candles, and staying up until the first morning light. Those celebrating on space stations rely on the artificial day/night cycle to signal festivity\u2019s end. Many long-term spacers consider it bad luck to skip the holiday, lest they attract unfavorable attention from the dead. Holos of dead loved ones are often brought out and adorned with green and black ribbons, a reference to colors of the <em>Vara</em> crew\u2019s uniforms. A hauler on a job might set up a holo of a dead celebrity and adjust the colors for lack of better options. Those on long haul journeys or on explorer vessels still avoid travel to the Hades system in late October.", "title": "Galactapedia: Day of the Vara", "id": "RkGQqpJwGp", "slug": "day-of-the-vara", "template": "Event", "type": "galactapedia"}, {"objectID": "f8910d59603bf_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Humans and Tevarin first made contact with one another shortly after Dr. Kellar Lench of the New Horizons Research Institute discovered a jump point into the Elysium system.

It is celebrated each year on March 15th throughout the United Empire of Earth (UEE).</p><br/><h1>Origin</h1><br/><p>In the mid-22nd century, the people of Earth (Sol III) established Humanity\u2019s first successful extraplanetary colony on Mars. This was the second attempt at colonization; the first Human colony on Mars failed late in the terraforming process when an error in the atmosphere processors led to sudden mass atmospheric collapse. 4,876 Humans died. The second attempt at a colony was largely regarded as doomed. In a widely-circulated article on the potential dangers a Mars immigrant might face, Kelsey Forset of Sentinel NewsOrg simply wrote, \u201cDon\u2019t tempt fate.\u201d This message was ultimately co-opted: \u201cTempt Fate\u201d with \u201cDon\u2019t\u201d crossed out became an unofficial slogan of the early Mars colonists.</p><br/><p>In 2200, multiple Earth-based governments announced plans for an interplanetary holiday to celebrate 45 successful years of Human habitation on Mars. It would be held during the following Earth-Mars conjunction (18th March 2202) to emphasize the connection between the planets. Martian schoolchildren were invited to submit possible names for the new holiday. \u201cStella Fortuna\u201d was selected from an entry provided by Estelle Priya, age 11, of Port Renatus Public School 17.</p><br/><p>Large public carnivals sponsored by space travel and terraforming companies were held on Mars and Earth. They featured rides, food, games, and half-price tickets to attractions throughout the Sol System, from space stations on the asteroid belt to the volcanoes of Io. New parcels of land on Mars were raffled off to festival attendees, along with a ship outfitted with a quantum engine provided by Roberts Space Industries. Local businesses sold souvenirs stamped with the slogan \u201cWe Tempted Fate: Stella Fortuna 2202.\u201d The day ended with a green and gold firework display.</p><br/><p>Stella Fortuna was held at varying times of the year during Earth-Mars conjunctions for over a half century. In 2257, the majority of governments on Earth and Mars declared March 15th the official holiday. While March 18th was initially proposed, it was not selected due to conflict with another holiday - the anniversary of the first Human born on a planet other than Earth.</p><br/><h1>Celebration and Traditions</h1><br/><p>Stella Fortuna has evolved from a holiday commemorating the early Mars colony to one that celebrates good fortune, boldness, tempting fate, and embarking on new business ventures. This was caused by a number of factors, but the against-all-odds success of the Mars colony combined with the long-term success of early settlers were two major influences. In particular, the families who won land during the first Stella Fortuna did a great deal to promote the idea that the holiday was associated with good luck. By the time the holiday\u2019s final date was selected, people preparing for interplanetary trips were already asking the stars for their blessing. It became a tradition in the late 2200s for explorers to toast the stars before embarking on searches for jump points, or for people launching new business ventures to begin them on March 15th.</p><br/><p>The largest celebrations still occur on Mars. Most businesses close for the holiday and the day after. The festival officially kicks off with a parade featuring elaborately decorated floats in the form of spaceships or stars.

So an interdiction device will be used to pull someone out of quantum travel which will be popular with pirates of course. One of the problems when creating the device was where does it eject the person in quantum? At first they had it do it right where they were, but then it made distress beacons useless because the pirates would have already killed the person. Then they thought they would increase the distance by 5-10 miles and so it takes time and allows them to get reinforcements, but then the person would just spool up their quantum drive after 30 seconds to a minute to get away. So what they decided on an area of effect mechanic where the person who initiates the interdiction field will determine how much power to use and then that determines the range of the interdiction device is and also the shape of the curve, the shape of the curve will dictate the probability of where you'll end up.

And I said I'd met Travis in a, I think I said, Serbian prison camp: he took a knife for me once and I've been indebted to him ever since.KT: Ah.DV: It was said, just, offhandedly there was no intention ... I could have said a Japanese prison camp or an Antarctic prison camp. It didn't matter, the joke was regarding the prison camp itself that he took a knife for me once and I've been indebted to him ever since. That was the joke but because I used a certain countries reference that does have a history of particular turmoil a lot of viewers from that region were really upset. And I know it sounds very superficial but it actually did change the way present information and the way I think about certain answers and the way I actually approach certain individual within in the company as far as being more, not necessarily being politically correct or culturally aware, but it did remind me that we have a very wide audience. And while trying to walk the neutral line is an impossible thing ultimately there is a way information can be presented in a very humorous way and while still being able to maintain an objective conclusion.KT: Staying professional is pretty important.DV: Right. Anything from you?KT: I can't think of anything specifically. What I will suggest though is that we do get a lot of feedback from the community and it's terrific. Keep it coming.

So I guess I'm sort of debating about this, because I'm not sure you'd want to be flying and have an asteroid, you know, 10,000 asteroids on your radar because that would be a lot of noise.  I think we'd definitely have the bigger, like an asteroid over a certain size, or an asteroid base would show up on it, and ship chunks, but basically the system already does that because everything in space is what you'd call an entity.  So a spaceship is an entity, an asteroid is an entity, a projectile is an entity, a floating pilot would be an entity.  So it's really about filtering out what you want to see.  Right now, we filter out everything but the spaceships and the missiles, but we could have modes where you know, you might want to say \"I'm just looking for downed pilots,\" or \"I'm looking for reclaimed debris\", and it wouldn't be too hard for us to actually do.   I think at some point we'd have those scanners put in there, say for instance if you're in the Reclaimer and you're looking for debris, you'd probably have a scanner that would look for debris areas.  Now maybe it won't give you a location of every piece of debris, because that would be too much, but it would say, there's a good concentration of debris over here, so maybe this is a good place to go reclaim some debris.  So I guess the answer is, yes we can do it.  We can do it right now.  The only reason we haven't done it yet is because we've been combat focused in Arena Commander and obviously you care more about other spaceships and missiles.  It's really about filtering out what you see and what you don't see.  The question mark with it is say with an asteroid field, you probably don't want to see every asteroid because that'd be too much, so set a filter to have it only be asteroids over a certain size or whatever it would be or only asteroids so close to you would be another way of doing it.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 66", "source": "https://youtu.be/VGTj2iWkS-8", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "time": "19m45s", "user": "RustySpoork", "published_at_timestamp": 1442269621}, {"objectID": "1036d9d692af19_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "This is going to depend on the fighter!

Abel", "published_at_timestamp": 1413842404}, {"objectID": "373679160", "question": "Could you confirm that the 'Full 6DOF' control / IFCS mode will be implemented, and outline how the various IFCS modes are likely to be implemented (IFCS upgrades, programmable IFCS options, specific IFCS modules limited to certain ships, etc).", "answer": "We are definitely going to be doing a full 6 degrees of freedom control mode. So, and this will be in the release that's coming out very shortly you'll be able to do that (what we call internally \"release 13\"). But the way we're thinking, because there's two basic requests... 1) People want to be able to have the full control and they want to go forwards and backwards, left, right, up and down, and also roll, and have to sort of additive. So, right now if you went into decoupled mode you can strafe left or right but it always goes back to the neutral position. And so what we're gonna change it around to is that you can go into the decoupled mode, and basically that's putting you into the 6DOF mode, and in that mode you can either change your rotation OR you can do additive motion - so you can basically go left or right, forward or back, up and down, as well as doing the roll and everything else, but it's not taking you back to neutral. So if you thrust right 5 times, you keep going right until you thrust left 5 times to cancel it out - which is sort of true 6DOF. On top of that, we're also going to be adding the option in standard IFCS to be able to strafe left, right, up and down as you're flying around. So you'll basically have the best of both worlds. You'll have the full control of being able to spin, go left, right, up and down in your ship and not ever go neutral, so you can sort of do that... or when you're flying around on the IFCS doing a turn, you'll also have the ability to give you some side thrust or whatever. So like if you're going head-on-head and people want to strafe you can maybe burst out without having to leave the IFCS mode, and then that will bring you back to your path before. So it allows more maneuvering and more options than we had before, and for us that sort of felt like that was the best option how to get the 6DOF to work in our system, because it's not particularly viable to have IFCS and 6DOF working together because they basically fight against each other 'cause IFCS is trying to fly you a certain way. So it certainly can... you can tell the IFCS system, \"oh I wanna go left, or I wanna go right for a bit,\" but then IFCS is always wanting to get you back to a certain heading and velocity.So the way we look at it is we're going to add strafe ability to the normal flight mode, and then when you go into decoupled mode that's really your 6DOF mode, and so the moving around laterally, your vector changes are all additive now so they won't be going back to neutral. And then obviously you can do your orientation changes. I think hopefully that will satisfy a lot of the people out there.And then longer-term, in terms of how we're gonna do it, I think it's too early to say, but the kinda concept was that on the more basic ships you had a basic IFCS system - maybe you don't even have all these functionality or features - it just sort of flies in a very simple manner. But then if you have a more complicated one then you can get more of these features enabled, and maybe the reaction times are better, and maybe there's more customization on the more expensive ones. Because it would be kind of nice to different flight modules you can program into, so, you know, there's a sort of expensive customize-able one that really allows you to tweak everything that you want to do. That's still in the process of figuring out exactly how we're going to do that. Not in terms of how technically we do it, because it's pretty easy 'cause the features are all there - it's just a matter of what you turn on and off. It's more about like how best to do it in the items and then provide the interface for the player.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 34 (2014.08.18)", "source": "https://youtu.be/y4wAP1fWe8c", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Logical Chimp", "published_at_timestamp": 1408399954}, {"objectID": "373684830", "question": "Are NPCs a finite figure in the galaxy?

Then other places the population would be contracting because that part of the galaxy's not doing so well or is getting involved in battles or wars.So the numbers of NPCs in the galaxy will probably fluctuate a certain amount, but probably not enough that you'll be able to see a material difference in the overall galaxy. Probably in local systems, you'll appreciate whether this system's booming and there's a lot more people there, or it's not doing very well and there's less people there. And I'm not so sure that you could wipe out an entire race.If we did that, that would be more of a controlled, game master event, but right now we have no plans for that.
