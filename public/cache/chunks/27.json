It is one of many varieties of flowering plants indigenous to Terra (Terra III) with a solitary flower featuring a conical spiral of petals over the pistil. Its vibrant color, strong scent, and long blooming season have earned it a prominent place in Terran culture.<br/><p>Found primarily in the tropical regions of Terra, the Emperor Bloom Reserve in the state of Vastac attracts thousands of sightseers every year.</p><br/><h6>Description and Life Cycle</h6><br/><p>The mature plant features a single, thick stem with simple, basal, elliptical leaves. When the plant begins preparing to flower, it develops a dark brown husk coated in brown fuzz that averages 15 cm in length. One by one, the Emperor Bloom drops its leaves as its energy is redirected into incubating the blossom. Finally, the husk turns a deep purple and unfurls into a spectacular, three-tiered flower in showy shades of violet.</p><br/><p>It blooms during the temperate dry season, when average temperatures reach 25 C. The outer petals of the flower drop off when temperatures begin to average above 32 C. The conical spiral of petals in the center harden and darken as the plant develops its seeds. At the height of the dry season, the pods burst open and hundreds of fluffy seeds are picked up by the late-dry winds and propagated to germinate at the beginning of the wet season.</p><br/><h6>Discovery</h6><br/><p>In 2559, a group of early planetary surveyors came across a field of these flowers on the outskirts of what would later become Prime. Specimens were collected and brought back to the settlement, where they were cultivated over centuries to maximize flower size, scent, and brightness of color. Today\u2019s domestic Emperor Bloom is larger in size than its wild cousins and has a longer flowering time.</p><br/><h6>Cultural Significance</h6><br/><p>The Emperor Bloom has become an unofficial symbol for Terra\u2019s natural beauty. It\u2019s celebrated on Terra with the Twilight Festival, which is held every year in Vastac at the start of blooming season. The morning of the festival, ships both airborne and aquatic cross the Zaffre Bay from Prime to reach the vast Emperor Bloom reserve. Temporary viewing areas are made available to attendees so they can enjoy the flowers without accidentally trampling them. Food, music, and games are featured at the festival, along with an outdoor market where attendees can purchase their own Emperor Blooms. Just after sunset, the elected chairman of the festival simultaneously illuminates hundreds of lights that have been staked among the flowers.</p>", "title": "Galactapedia: Emperor Bloom", "id": "R56EXX3QWN", "slug": "emperor-bloom", "template": "PlantAnimal", "type": "galactapedia"}, {"objectID": "19285b91c07e8_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Tradeway", "answer": "Tradeways are ports of entry maintained by the United Empire of Earth (UEE) for the purpose of exchanging goods with other civilizations such as the Banu Protectorate or the Xi'an Empire.

Sloma is made up of a base liquid that is then altered by the addition of disparate ingredients brought to the table by everyone involved in the given social situation. After the concoction brews for a few moments, the resulting beverage is called sloma.<br/><h1>Known History</h1><br/><p>Since they were initially encountered, Banu have usually opened negotiations, be they political, business-related, or otherwise, with the creation and consumption of sloma. The first Banu-Human Interstellar Peace and Trade Accord was hashed out over sloma created from ingredients contributed by General Neal Socolovich and a Protectorate Trade Essosouli, among others. Because Banu do not keep historical records, there is no definitive evidence that points to the origin of the practice. The Essosouli present at the first Peace and Trade Accord, when asked about sloma, simply replied that it was how things were done. Human and Xi\u2019an xenoanthropologists believe that the practice likely began before either civilization encountered the Banu.</p><br/><h1>Details of the Practice</h1><br/><p>Before negotiations begin, either a Banu who is hosting or a Banu who has previously agreed to host will provide the slomaddon, a usually ornately decorated vessel in which sloma is prepared. It will be partially filled with one of a variety of carrier liquids. Once the slomaddon has been opened, each participant of the deal or meeting will add something to it. Spice is one of the more popular additives, as it is light, easy to carry, and can significantly alter the sloma\u2019s flavor. However, anything that is safe to eat or drink is acceptable. This can create unique flavors. Banu can safely consume food that is dangerous for Humans, Xi\u2019an, and Tevarin, so it is a good idea to request that everyone bring ingredients that are respectful of their various dietary limitations. After the sloma has macerated for a few minutes, the host will provide cups, into which they will serve the resulting drink. Everyone is expected to partake.</p><br/><p>Methods by which Banu create and consume sloma can vary: some may serve it hot, some may serve it cold, some may ask you to bring a carrier liquid and vessel, some may insist upon drinking directly from the slomaddon, some may not use liquid at all and instead offer to share food. As with the original version, participants are still expected to add something to the dish. While food isn\u2019t technically sloma, it fulfills the same purpose.</p><br/><p>Consensus among Banu is that sloma is used to ensure all involved in a contract are entering into it without ill intent. Because everyone, from low-ranking assistants to the most powerful Essosouli, must drink the sloma from the same vessel, so no one can slip poison to anyone else. Especially careful Banu may insist upon randomly mixing cups, in case someone has laced one or more of them with poison instead of the sloma. Some Banu believe that the flavor of the sloma can positively or negatively portend how negotiations will go. Other Banu attach no importance to the flavor whatsoever.</p>", "title": "Galactapedia: Sloma", "id": "boxDDjWYJ7", "slug": "sloma", "template": null, "type": "galactapedia"}, {"objectID": "155714d8849b0d_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The Olympus Pool is a unique cosmic phenomenon located in the Goss system.

And if they are crewing a ballistic turret, part of the idea of sophisticated AI is for them to know their weapons. If they are using an energy weapon they know they can't use it too much or else it's overheating; a ballistic one they should maybe make their shots count, if they have not so much ammo then maybe they won't be as liberal with shooting as if they had lots of ammo. So that will all be part of the AI.Obviously AI is an ongoing quest; we'll constantly be working on it and improving and adding to it. So the early AI may not be as sophisticated as the stuff we'll have later on down the road but all those will be factors that should and will be considered in the AI.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 69", "source": "https://youtu.be/AiTY_K7bDys", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Vacation", "published_at_timestamp": 1447110918}, {"objectID": "373681160", "question": "Given the level of fidelity shown in the recent Gamescom demo and the Social Module v0 release, I was wondering what the road map for developing 100 complete star systems looks like. Could you provide some idea of how star systems will be rolled out to the community in the long term?", "answer": "Even though you've just seen ArcCorp, we've got quite a few other locations that we've been working on.  More importantly, we've been working on these base architecture sets which we've talked about before.  We use this architecture style in ArcCorp that we call Structuralism.  Structuralism is one of the five or six fundamental architecture sets that we're going to have in the universe of Star Citizen.  Other examples would be Super Modernism, which you've kind of seen in the high end sort of luxury hangar, also sort of stuff you'd see on Terra.  We'd have Monumentalism, which would be the big edifices, big, sort of huge imposing buildings.  Our own version of Monumentalism would be the kind of stuff you'd see in Rome, with the Colliseum, these big imposing monuments of civilization. So that's monumentalism.We have Colonialism, which is more of like frontier outposts, ??Hannowism??, which is sort of more like this bunker style stuff.  So we have these various differenty styles of architecture, and they are built of modular pieces called the tier sets, and so a good example is in the Stanton system which will be the first system that you will be adventuring around, we're putting you in the large world map, a sort of fictionalized version of Stanton, not the proper Stanton, that will come online separately, and then we'll just activate it.  But Stanton has four main planets in it, and each of the main planets has a distinct feel.  You're on ArcCorp, and you know, the big thing with the Stanton system is that the planets were sold off to various corporations, so ArcCorp owns one, Hurston Dynamics owns another one, Microtech owns another one, and Crusader Industries owns another one.  Crusader are the guys that built the Starliner.  So each one of those places is quite distinct, Crusader sort of these floating buildings around the gas giant that allows them to build these bigger ships, not constrained so much by gravity.  Then you have Hurston Dynamics which is sort of like this industrial world, an industrial wasteland where it's full of smog and foundries, it looks like something from the beginning of Joe Versus the Volcano.  And then we have ArcCorp which is this whole world covered by this city essentially.  And then we have Microtech which is the company behind the mobiGlas and sim stuff, and they are on a perpetually cold snowy planet, so they've all got very different feels to them, but they all fundamentally underneath it all use this structuralism set with some modifications and styles, so they have some sort of unique bespoke aspects for each one of these locations, but they all use this common building set and then materials, colors, and stuff change out.  So we're building these sets, and they are interchangeable, and modular and can be built on top of each other to allow us once we've got those building blocks in place, to be able to deliver a lot more of these locations.  One of the first things we'd deliver would be the Stanton system with these four different planets you can travel between and get missions, do business, and trade.  And then, we'd ultimately open up some jump gates to go to other systems and that's kind of our plan.  You know right now we're going to give you this large world map which comes with multi-crew which will be a baby version of Star Citizen.  You'll be able to do a lot of the things you'll be able to do in Star Citizen, but missing a bunch of the functionality we plan and full time proper persistence.  Being able to buy and sell different stuff in game will be coming pretty soon, landing and taking off from different planets won't be there, but will be something we'll be rolling in, but that will be our test bed, I think I mentioned this before, as a multi-crew.  And then we'll be building these systems, in parallel, when we have our first one ready to go, BAM!  We'll drop you in it, and then we'll be flying around our very first system which will be Stanton.  And then some more systems which will come online and we'll open up jump points between them and we'll slowly expand out.  The plan is, we're laying a lot of track, with these pieces that we're putting together and you're going to start to see the benefit of all that coming towards the end of this year and through next year where all these pieces have been built, and then it is quite quick for us to lay out the environments where you'd land.  Yes, there's a lot of crafted stuff, but we're also using some systematic or procedural tools to populate stuff.  So there will be like &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; you put a bar in there, and there will be all sorts of rules with a bar, like I can just populate NPCs around and they'll be like, \"Oh, there's a bar nearby.  I'll go there to have a drink after work and then after that I'll go to my home\".  We'll set all that up, that's what subsumption is, as mentioned in Tony's plan, but people would have their lives and all this other stuff that we've talked about.  So, that's kind of the plan, we're planning to deliver more systems.  Just to let you know, when it says 100 complete star systems, we don't mean we're delivering 100 complete star systems tomorrow or all in one day because you know, we got to a bunch of our star systems in our stretch goals, and also some of these star systems are to be explored and found.  So, our focus is to get the core UEE space and the surrounding systems.  The ones that you see will be on the star map, which we'll be revealing and sharing on the web next month, you'll have the first couple of key systems where you'll be able to adventure in, in more detail on this star map and then the other ones will be more high level, and then as we get into them, we'll build them up.  But, that's the plan is to start with one system and then move our way out.  We're sort of laying the groundwork for that.    So that's our plan, that's how we'll roll them out, but not committing to specific dates though cause I've learned that issue.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 66", "source": "https://youtu.be/VGTj2iWkS-8", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "time": "8m23s", "user": "Fastball115", "published_at_timestamp": 1442269621}, {"objectID": "d5a17061911f8_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The fuel mechanic is still being developed and is likely something that will shift significantly based on actual game balance.

Is this only to update map size or will it allow the game to use more memory, as it relates to the 64-bit update?", "answer": "Travis Day: So in this particular case when we're talking about double precision, yes the goal is to update the map size. Basically with single precision what you end up running into a lot of times is precision errors, meaning that in world space - and that's what we're talking about when we say \"double precision\" is world space double precision - it is like increasing the fidelity of your grid. And so, when you normally in single precision have a whole bunch of different things attached, like for example the helmets - have you guys noticed if you really far off to the edge of the map your helmets and your visors can start to jitter and shake a little bit? The reason you're seeing that is because they are are only about, I think it's 8cm from your face, so as you are out, say 5000m from the origin of the level, it's now trying to calculate your world position but then maintain accuracy for something that's only 8cm from your face. And as it starts to round things - since it only has so many bits that it can store the number in for your position - it starts to introduce more and more error. And it gets compounded when you're doing things like, especially on the visor where it's the origin of the ship, then you do a bone transformation to find the pilot seat, then you do a transformation to find the characters head, and then you do a transformation to curve the shader of the glass... and all of those math problems are just compounding the error more and more, and then every frame when it does that you get a slightly different result which gives you the jitter. So that is what we're trying to do, and then with double precision you get maps that are potentially so large that it's never gonna be an issue.Now, when we talk about allowing the game to use more memory, that's more of a Windows thing, and how Windows sees the game. So currently we compile the game in 64-bit so it has the memory capacity of a 64-bit game, so it's not limited in that capacity. But that is a Windows standard, not a \"we're doing that in the engine\" standard - that's how you compile it.Alex Mayberry: Yeah, I'd say anybody that's done a lot of modding, let's say Unreal or Quake, you know the hall-of-mirrors effect you'd get when you compile a map - that's a precision error. That's a case of a vertex not being exactly where it should be because it's been rounded, and it creates an error and you get that kind of effect.TD: Yeah.Darian Vorlick: I got nothin' ...AM: You got nothing.

Essentially what we'll do is put someone IN your holding cell, so maybe you arrest them when you board their ship, or perhaps you stun them on planetside (if we're allowing you to do that) then that person/what they look like will \"appear\" in the cell through a cutscene or similar visuals, and on the other side the player will come back into the world in their own way.", "title": "10 For the Chairman: Episode 45 (2014.11.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/qXwybQaAbbs", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Craigr910", "published_at_timestamp": 1416257116}, {"objectID": "373678380", "question": "Is there a compelling reason to land planetside in the 85x instead of the 890, particularly since the 85x can't carry cargo and the 890 can land in atmosphere?

Can it be spacejacked, pirated, destroyed or otherwise bothered?", "answer": "Ok, so that's a fairly interesting question, I think, In general, this hasn't been thought out that much... I'd think there shouldn't be a reason why the 890 couldn't be left in orbit while you were landing the 85x... I'd say that the 890 would remain in and orbit instance if you had friends or NPCs on it, if it gets attacked they would defend it or whatever. If you've left the ship and come back to it anything that has happened or hasn't you'll be able to see on your return. That's a complete \"off the gut\" answer from me, because the mechanics of that haven't been worked out. There are a lot of these edge cases that we need to work out, as we're giving you so many choices and options like this.

So it sort of encourages people to go around and explore, and take advantage of economic disparity between one system and another system. So one of the ways would be potentially in one area of the galaxy it would be more expensive to borrow money than another area. And those are all sort of ways that we can dynamically affect where players want to go, because some if some area raises it's tax... like if an area is overcrowded and overpopulated, if the taxes are raised in that area then players will probably tend to go to other areas where it will be cheaper to operate.

There's a huge amount of assets that have to be built, like the ships you'e seen, all the different pieces have to have multiple damaged parts, various levels of damage, a whole bunch of really cool graphical stuff that we're going to do for that, and we're modeling it pretty detailed too.So there will definitely be the angle of incidence of a projectile hitting armor and ship will count in terms of the damage, the penetration ability, all that. My goal is to have the actual base level of the game actually physically detailed to a level I haven't done in one ofmy past games and then just have the high-end ship control stuff make it easier to fly around in and use, but underneath it all, it's all physically correctly modeled. So we're actually modeling internal system damage.So if you have a targeting computer, avionics, system, life support, inside your ship, we actually have a place physically for it and it has its own geometry and render geometry. If a projectile goes through the shield then penetrates through the armor, we actually trace that projectile and if it hits that system in the physical space, then the system takes damage and potentially gets damaged.So we're actually modeling all of this in an extremely detailed way.

That's like \"how long is a piece of rope.\" So there's a lot to exploration. It's not just going to be looking for an undiscovered jump point, plotting the jump point, and going to the new system on the other side. There's going to be a lot of mapping that will happen so even in systems that are known not all of the space is mapped. So basically there will be certain areas on the trade lanes and the general areas that you pass that will have nav-points on them and be mapped to a certain extent, but the vast amount of it won't be mapped. So maybe you find an asteroid field that isn't on the map, maybe that asteroid field has some really good minerals, or maybe there's a wreck. So we're going to try and add things to discover even in known space. So we're really trying to up the amount of things that you can do if you're an explorer where it's not just about jump points or finding a new system even though that's pretty cool. But obviously we can't do everything all at once at the beginning so that's all stuff in the content we'll build to. Then the other thing I'll say is that we're doing a lot of work in R&D on procedural content generation. I know a lot of people think \"Oh all of Star Citizen is completely scripted,\" or designed and crafted, and yes it has a huge amount of stuff like Terra and Earth where pretty much everything will be hand crafted. But to build the universe on this scale we need to balance some procedural stuff as well as crafted stuff, which is the way I think is actually the best way to build a big expansive universe. It's the same way that we're approaching the gameplay. You can't script every mission so we're actually building it in such a way that the universe itself dynamically runs itself and the player interactions generate a lot of the missions and the intrigue and the action. So I didn't answer what will plotting a jump be like. Well it should be a lot of fun and very scary and very risky. A jump point is sort of a rip in the space-time continuum that takes you almost instantly between two points many light years from each other. So the concept with it is to have, I don't know whether it's the space-time fabric as a big breaker if you want to think of it in surfing terms, you want to surf in and hit exactly the right lines or else you're going to go off track and potentially get ripped apart or spat out in some random part of the universe. Obviously this will require a combination of some skill and some specific equipment, but once you've gone through and you've recorded your jump, you can then turn around and sell that to the government or share it with your friends, and then obviously you can name the jump point or the system after yourself. It should be pretty cool. It should be like trying to ride the various big waves off the north shore of Hawaii, but with cool space effects.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 04 (2014.01.10)", "source": "https://youtu.be/FsWDLHVYNHI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Tsunami Juarai", "published_at_timestamp": 1389377198}]
