Will it involve carving up ships for scrap (or resources in the repair profession), specifically seeking out functioning or expensive parts of derelict ships, or some combination of those? Will this be like mining and require good scanning to effectively find salvageable ships and stations?", "answer": "TZ: Yeah mentally I break salvage into two different concepts. One is what I call scavenging when you\u2019re actually extracting entire pieces of value from other ships, could be engines, could be weapons, could be cargo whatever. Then there\u2019s also what I\u2019d call scrapping which is basically the extraction of the raw materials. You\u2019re actually pulling off the metal plating from the wings and stuff like that.<br /><br />We\u2019ve talked about having these elements distributed in a logic fashion so that the players that are more knowledgeable about where the most valuable elements and stuff are on a particular ship can strip the most valuable pieces that much more quickly. So what you\u2019re going to wind up having is a tier of players: some of interested in one thing or the other, some of them are interested in only the most valuable parts and then they quickly move on looking for other things to scrap. Other players are basically looking at completely reducing a ship down just a husk and leaving no value behind.<br /><br />CR: Yeah to be more specific to answer the question. It is going to be a combination of both so you\u2019ll be able to just take general sort of debris and essentially scrap it into whatever salvageable material that you will be able to use or resell. Then you can also look to salvage working individual items. So if a wing blows off, but maybe it has a functioning gun that hasn\u2019t been damage or damaged very much, if you can find that and detach that from the wing than you\u2019ve got a second hand item you can sell.<br /><br />Both those are going to be part of the salvage profession and Tony was talking about the next level which is scanning and knowing the aspects of a ship that may be the best to salvage. So you don\u2019t want to maybe salvage the entire hull, but perhaps this part of the hull has whatever titanium armour and therefore is more valuable than another part of the hull so that will be the part that you want to salvage or dissolve into your big salvage tank.,<br /><br />TZ: And one of things I really like about that particular concept is that it scales really well to any number of players. In other words when you think about a salvage ship as having one laser or whatever it is that is basically going to pull the materials off of there, you\u2019ve only got a single player that can actually engage in that and if you want more maybe we could add a second one of these devices, but you\u2019re still going to be fairly limited.<br /><br />If you start to turn this into something to where players with their individual hand controlled stuff, it can basically extract things then you have two things: one it becomes very time consuming at that level, at a personal level to scrap an entire ship, but it\u2019s actually still very cost effective if you have done this enough as such that you know where all the most valuable areas are and that\u2019s all you\u2019re going to bother so. So what I would say is when you're talking about scrapping the entirety of a ship, that\u2019s probably going to be you\u2019re going to aim the fire house at it, the big dedicated device, but when you\u2019re talking about just extracting bits of value you quickly get in get out maybe because there\u2019s a lot of residual dangers in that area, then it actually becomes very effective to have you and four, six guys who's maybe other players, friends of y ours, other NPCs that you\u2019ve hired to just attack it in mass, just hit the valuable parts and then go on.<br /><br />CR: Yup, absolutely. So there you go. All those things will be there so I think salvaging will be quite and graphically kind of already handle it with the damage shader because you can sort of dissolve off the surface in a more regular pattern and you\u2019re taking off the top of the hull for salvage.<br /><br />TZ: This is a great example where we\u2019re reusing technology from one purpose to another and we\u2019re actually going to do the same thing, repair is actually going to be largely\u2026<br /><br />CR: The other way.<br /><br />TZ: the inverse of this process to where you take all the raw materials that you\u2019ve stored in your ship and you can dispatch three,  or four, or six guys or the big dedicated device depending upon how quickly you want to move across the entire ship and repair just select areas.<br /><br />CR: Yup, alright so the 7th most popular question comes from...", "published_at": "2017-03-14", "title": "Star Citizen: 10 for the Chairman - Professions in Alpha 3.0", "source": "https://youtu.be/Uhra2SETLNs", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "End-yo", "time": "11m53s", "published_at_timestamp": 1489533309}, {"objectID": "373690150", "question": "So I actually did want to start right by jumping into this journey.

And as we\u2019ve continued to get support from our community, our backers, we\u2019ve realized that not only do they want a game that is larger, more immersive, but that\u2019s the game that we want to make. So as we\u2019ve grown, we\u2019ve kind of reevaluated how we can maintain the expectations we set at the beginning, but also how we can establish the larger, more grand vision that is Star Citizen. And as you\u2019d expect, the production schedules and expectations just evolve with that. Generally for the better- cause we\u2019re still making, we\u2019ve made quite a lot of progress, there\u2019s quite a bit of game that\u2019s out there and playable now, that\u2019s given us an immense amount of feedback towards systems and features, where we need to focus, where we should focus less\u2026 working with the crowdfunding community is incredible. So it just naturally evolved, right? Like what are the features that make Star Citizen, Star Citizen? And once we get those established, how do we iterate and build on top of that? So I would say that over time, we\u2019ve evolved for the better, and delivered on some things quicker than expected, and some things are taking a bit longer.

So we worked with them as well as contacting people on our own and it's a real kind of fun balance between accuracy and the fantasy elements and a lot of times it just comes down to does it feel right?Which is kind of a thing when you're striking that balance between what is fun because sometimes real hard science facts can be either like, stop you from doing something that would be otherwise really fun, it can also be so crazy that it doesn't feel right when you hear it like there's this weird thing that you get too accurate and it goes against what people's common expectations are and so you have to say, alright even if this is true, it's going to really confuse people to do it that way.AW: Make for bad gameplayWW: And then you're going to have to explain it to people, \"Oh but this is scientifically accurate even though it feels very wrong\".

Because, as we iterate down the road, there are going to be unique developments in that particular build on Arena Commander that may not happen in Star Marine, so when we go to merge the builds all those bugs that we fixed in Arena Commander may either resurface in Star Marine or things that were going smoothly in Star Marine may cause bugs in Arena Commander.  So, having them developed simultaneously in a seamless system makes it a lot easier.  Things like changing the skeletons for the animations on the characters &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; having them unified is a good way of doing that.  So, without going into a multihour long discussion about the logistics, probably one of the best ways to describe it is for developmental purposes of keeping things very similar to one another to avoid having bugs.EKD: Yeah.DV: I hope that works for you.EKD: It was directed at you.DV: Well, also just really quick if you go to the website, if you look at Chris Roberts' Star Marine and FPS update, it does give some information on the development of this.  On why certain things have happened within development of Star Marine.  So you may find some information relevant there as well.  I highly recommend reading it &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; it's a very good writeup by Chris.", "published_at": "2015-07-13", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 09 (2015.07.13)", "source": "https://youtu.be/ouf5jzk9qg0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "xTODMANx", "published_at_timestamp": 1436825509}, {"objectID": "9f1d06dd9852e_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "No, right now it's only planned to have you getting in/out of the seats while the ship is in Horizontal mode.

Something like taking a five man FPS team into a Vanduul mining station or arms factory and either steathing or killing everything that moves on your way to the objective?", "answer": "Yes. Absolutely, that's actually a core part of the PvE FPS gameplay mechanic we're designing for the PU. We're coming up with a really cool mission building system for the PU, Tony talked a little about it earlier, but missions won't necessarily be stand-alone, some will interlink, or drive into other ones. We've got an awesome NPC/Boss-NPC system, if anyone has player Shadow of Mordor and liked their nemesis system, this takes it another level beyond that, it'll add a much more personal level of interaction, your actions will effect those NPCs and those around you etc. Plus, global ones that affect all the players, so some pirate that might be your nemesis could gain enough infamy that he becomes the pirate lord in that system, where all players can go after him. We've got a really cool system worked out for all of that, blending into the economy. Part of this is to create encounters, such as going to a set of ruins, where graverobbers might attack you, or a derelict mining station that might have pirates that'll attack. There are going to be a whole bunch of that gameplay both on the ground and in space that'll allow for solo or co-op play that stretches beyond the PvP or general PvE gameplay that you can do. We will definitely have the ability to do the \"dungeon raid\" with your friends, but it'll be more reactive/interactive/spawned by the PU and integrated into it more than you'd see in other games.", "published_at": "2015-02-02", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 52 (2015.02.02)", "source": "https://youtu.be/uZm3iwplH_s", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Apocraphon", "published_at_timestamp": 1422918006}, {"objectID": "373677650", "question": "It seems to me that SC/SQ42 development is proceeding at breakneck speed. How does the development pace compare to other games you've worked on? Also, how do you handle the extremely high standard that is being set because it must take considerably longer to get each step completed to \"CR\" quality but the backers continuously clamor for MOAR!", "answer": "Darian Vorlick: So, how do we handle the extremely high standard? Well, I'm actually indentured to Travis. I met Travis in a Serbian prison camp, and he took a knife for me once, and I've been indebted to him ever since. So I promised that I would uphold and champion his standards.Travis Day: [Laughter]. It's a similar story for me, except just with Chris and Serbia, so I really don't have much to add there.DV: I thought it was a Turkish prison camp>TD: Oh, that might have been it. Yeah I get this all... kinda that region... my geography's bad. My buddy is having a wedding in Costa Rica, and I thought \"oh, what part of the Caribbean is that in?\" then I looked at Google and I went, \"oh, Travis, your geography!\" [shakes head].Um, okay. How do we handle the breakneck speed? So actually, yeah lets say that the development does happen very quickly. One of the things that I think a lot of people don't fully appreciate is that during the development of this game so far, we've been building a company, doing pre-production on a game, and developing something that we're shipping to the public. So all 3 of those at once would normally happen, well at least where I've worked before has normally been a company that exists, and is a thing, and is large. The product that we're working on has 6 months to 12 months of pre-production before any real production takes place. And then we move into starting to develop what is known, the concrete plan, metrics, standards, everything. But with this we're kind of developing it along with you guys as we go, so you're getting to see it from even the very basic foundations. So that has been an interesting challenge - it also is kinda what makes it a lot of fun. I would say with that in mind that we are developing extremely quickly. I'm constantly impressed by the sheer volume of patches and content that we put out to the community. It's gonna be a long ride, so I think it's good to get as much as we can out there along the way.As for the \"CR\" level of quality, yeah, there are times I think that people have been frustrated or disappointed that they work on something for a really long time, and it's, you know, \"oh, it's gonna be great! it's gonna be great!\" and Chris looks at it and he has a whole bunch of critiques of how it could be a little bit better. You know, that's always disappointing, but then you come back at it, and you look at it and you go, \"oh my god, yeah - it really does look better,\" and you kind of implement that feedback, and it's always, for me at least, has helped me to push my standards higher for what is acceptable in a game, what I'm proud of. And I really enjoy the emphasis on quality, 'cause I've definitely worked on games where quality is not the emphasis - the emphasis is getting it shipped - and so I think that for the community, well, you're really privileged to have somebody that cares that much about quality.DV: That, and we are just as committed to it. We have an incredibly talented group of developers, artists, engineers, programmers. And to kind of echo what Travis said, it's hard not to be impressed with the speed that these guys and gals turn out content. They're incredibly talented, incredibly skilled, and they do it under a lot of pressure. And so when Chris gives his feedback it's because we all have that same perfectionist attitude, that we wanna see this thing not only surpass your guys' expectations, but our own. And like I said before, we have just as high expectations for this project as you guys do, and as Chris does, and we want to see all of us have that same unified vision come to fruition. If it's something that when we release it to the public, if we're not all on board then what does that say about us? We want to make sure that that quality is there, so when it is released you guys can enjoy it, we can enjoy it, and we can point at it proudly... \"yeah, WE worked on this! We did this.\"TD: Yeah that's actually... that's a good point. Like there's so many times I'll be sitting at my desk and I'll turn to Chris, and I'll be like, \"can we just take all the crowdfunding money and invent a time machine, so we can go to the future and play this game with everybody?\" [laughs]", "published_at": "2014-12-08", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 01 (2014.12.08)", "source": "https://youtu.be/8Vjztd8mgjw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Flint Nefario", "published_at_timestamp": 1418080393}, {"objectID": "373678460", "question": "Are there any plans for missions that require luxury spaceships like the Phoenix or the 890 JUMP?", "answer": "Well I think so - I think there will definitely be some missions where you would be asked to, you know, \"would you be able to ferry a VIP from one location to another location\"... \"someone wants to rent a yacht to cruise to this area of space.\" So they definitely will be used for certain kinds of missions that would require a certain kind of ship, just like here in the real world. Some certain VIP, you know, the President of the United States, is not flying on a turboprop - he's flying on Air Force One. Just like a billionaire isn't gonna be-... you know, he generally doesn't fly commercial - he flies private - and so maybe he would be chartering his own 890 to get him from somewhere. So I think there will definitely be missions that will be like that, that would probably pay higher, but then there would be some risk, because maybe if someone is well-off or a trading magnate then that would be a magnet for pirates that would maybe want to kidnap and ransom that person. So yes, there are going to be missions for luxury spaceships.", "published_at": "2014-10-13", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 41 (2014.10.13)", "source": "https://youtu.be/4GflyTrFtTo", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Midnite", "published_at_timestamp": 1413243710}, {"objectID": "373679270", "question": "I was curious as to the level of breakdown of the mission boards in the PU. Will organizations have the ability to have a private mission board to set up missions for members to do?", "answer": "So yes, that is absolutely the case. You can, when you set up a mission, you'll be able to publish it as a public mission, or you'll be able to publish it to your organization, or a subset of your organization - that's kind of the way it should work. Or you could be able to publish it to a certain number of organizations, but not all the other ones, so it's sort of up to you when you post a mission who it will be available to or visible to. So I think you can run missions for your own crew, or you can have it with some friendly organizations, or for everyone - it's sort of up to you.", "published_at": "2014-08-11", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 33 (2014.08.11)", "source": "https://youtu.be/XBVkhXGX8iI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Ajax", "published_at_timestamp": 1407796258}, {"objectID": "373684940", "question": "How will commanding work in battles?Will we have some kind of strategic view of the area and can designate targets, objectives, and waypoints for individual players or designated wings?Kind of an RTS view for commanders?", "answer": "Commanding in space battles is gonna be interesting.Obviously the capital ships are gonna be a large part of that, and there's multiple stations on the capital ships. On a future date we're gonna have a really in-depth, behind the scenes, sort of like a Death of a Spaceman piece about what we'll do on the big capital ships to show you the level of sophistication that we're trying on that and just how all these different stations inside the ship can work together.'Cause just having a big ship is not gonna mean that you're gonna win a battle. You'll actually have to have a team of players that are operating the big ship well, in concert to be effective. I think that's true in real life, and it's gonna be pretty cool.One of the things we're talking about is a commanding base, usually there'll be a \"battle command\". I don't know who will be designated the commander, but there will be sort of a big holo-sphere, and you're gonna see a very small version in the dogfighting even, in the radars which are holo-spheres. But the big ones will be much bigger areas and essentially you're looking at this sphere and you're clicking, you can see these digital, holographic, versions of the various ships and their positions. You can click and give them a command or drag an arrow over and say attack over here.So you will essentially have an RTS view that you're communicating with. Then that from there will be sending messages to the person in his fighter, or in his bomber, or corvette, or whatever and say \"You're required to attack this ship.\"So it should be pretty cool. We're looking forward to it.

Generally the answer would be \"No, you need to own them,\" although I will have the caveat: In the very early stage of the Dogfighting Module, we are not going to have every one of the ships to the stage that they can actually dogfight. Yes you can climb in them, you can see them in the hangar, but there's a lot of extra detail that goes into the ships. All the different items, the thrusters, the damage states, the damage models, have to be done for the ship. And that just takes a lot of work and effort. So it will probably be the case where we may only have one ship or two ships at the beginning, and then it will increase. So the Hornet is the one we're focusing on right now, and obviously things like HUD change for different ships and all of that stuff, so it may be the case at the very beginning we just give everyone, everyone can basically fly the same ship. We just put a temporary \"test Hornet\" in the hangar and they get into that and they do the Dogfighting Module. But longer term, the ships you can take to play in arena mode against other people will be the ones you own in the hangar.", "published_at": "2014-02-07", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 02 (2013.12.13)", "source": "https://youtu.be/qwbU9FG5XlQ", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Villaovi", "published_at_timestamp": 1391813687}, {"objectID": "1264200001", "question": "Star Citizen will be utilizing AMD Mantle.

One of the big bottlenecks in PC game performance is how many draw cores you can actually get through the GPUs. Normally if you profile a modern based PC game, its CPU drops a little bit. Now you can have a whole bunch of Titans in it and they\u2019re not really doing much because they can\u2019t get all the information from the computer from the CPU side down to the GPU because it\u2019s getting bottle-necked in Direct X.<br/><br/>DirectX is really a multi-threaded API so at most I think it deals with two threads, whereas something like Mantle can basically exist on 8 threads\u2026So that\u2019s sort of the best thing about it, something like Mantle, is that it does a little multi-processing and it\u2019s a much better architecture to work with multi-processors and then it allows you to sort of bypass the OS along with the middle bloatware of something like DirectX.", "published_at": "2014-02-05", "title": "Star Citizen Interview: Chris Roberts On Building A Space Simulator For The Ages", "source": "https://gamingbolt.com/star-citizen-interview-chris-roberts-on-building-a-space-simulator-for-the-ages", "type": "article", "user": "Ravi Sinha", "published_at_timestamp": 1391558400}]
