The meeting that Chad was in that made him late to this episode was a meeting with CR about their progress, of which the mood is pretty positive because they've made \"very meaningful progress\". They've made some large changes to Object Containers in terms of how they load entities, separating them into Dynamic Entities and Static Entities, where the former are streamable but the latter aren't. They've made a Star Engine Service, which is written similar to game code but can be deployed as a cloud service. Using this they built the Star Hash Service, which is a kind of coordinate system across the universe (like geohashes), allowing them to partition the universe and know what's streaming when, as well as being able to store those things and look them up. They built a service to keep track of Entity Aggregates in the universe, \"which was kind of the roots of entity trees\". The Star Hash Service has also been hooked up to the Streaming Manager, which was previously created to govern CSOCS, so it knows if certain aggregates are streamed out, or whether to stream certain aggregate groups in. They've also implemented a Prototype In-Memory Persistence Model, which allows them to write out the state of any Star Hashes to a local cache whenever they're streamed out, so that they can test game code (like service beacons) to see what breaks. For SSOCS to work they need to implement Global Persistence, which completely changes how the game runs, and how entities are spawned and loaded. They've had to revisit existing gameplay features to make sure they aren't broken, which they've done. They next have to implement the real backend for persistence, because Global Persistence will require them to be able to handle a much higher volume of data, which is a Work In Progress. The last big thing is the changes to game code that are needed, which requires all game feature teams to revisit their features. They have unknown unknowns too, because they need to test heavily to know what work will need to be done. They're also considering phasing out SSOCS so it won't need Global Persistence for it's first release, because their Prototype Model is working well. The Player won't notice much difference, but there should be some streaming benefits from this. Server Meshing is a similar situation, but SSOCS is a prerequisite so there's only so much they can do before SSOCS is completed.<br />The engine they had was CryEngine, and now they have Lumberyard, both of which are level-loading based engines, so there's no entity streaming in them as-is. Years ago they made some large changes to the engine called Object Containers, which is their own grouping of entities as well as level data like brushes. They planned years in advance where they wanted to get to, both now and in the future, which was a huge push for foundational changes. They built on top of Object Containers with Net Bind Culling and Serialised Variables, allowing them at runtime to be able to replicate and unbind entities from Clients. Then last year they deployed Client-Side Object Container Streaming (CSOCS), which is taking the Object Containers at runtime and streaming them in and out, basically unbinding and binding Object Containers. That alone was a multi-year effort.<br />Now they're doing the same thing on the server (Server-Side Object Container Streaming) and that too is itself a large effort. It started in full force last year - they had a big summit where they got the programming disciplines together in Germany and had a week-long deep-dive on the specific implementation details for the effort across the entire game, including the core engine, game code, as well as the backend services in order to execute this. They've been working on SSOCS ever since then, which is almost a year now. Chad claims that they've made very meaningful progress, and that he just got out of a meeting with Chris Roberts about the progress they're making, and that the mood was pretty positive coming out of it.<br />Some notable things that have happened so far include: they've done a large set of changes to Object Containers in terms of how they load entities - they've now separated things out into what are called Dynamic Entities and Static Entities, essentially allowing them to differentiate between what is streamable and what isn't; they've made something called a Star Engine Service, which is a type of game service that is written in a similar way to game code but can be deployed as a cloud service; using the Star Engine Service they've built what they call the Star Hash Service, which is their version of a kind-of coordinate system across the universe similar to geohashes. This gives them a way to partition the universe so that they know what sections of the universe are streaming at any given time in an efficient way, as well as storing and looking them up efficiently.<br />So they built a service that keeps track of all of what they call Entity Aggregates in the universe, which was kind of the roots of entity trees. In addition, the Star Hash Service has been hooked up to the Streaming Manager. The Streaming Manager was previously created to govern the current CSOCS, but now they've done the work to connect it to the Star Hash Service too, to drive streaming events to indicate to it that certain aggregates are streamed out, or to collect certain aggregate groups and stream them in. They've still got a bunch of work to do, but what they've done is they've implemented a Prototype In-Memory Persistence Cache (I think he meant Model instead of Cache). For SSOCS to work they basically have to implement Global Persistence, which is a huge set of changes for the game, completely changing how the game runs and how entities are spawned and loaded. For testing purposes they made the Prototype In-Memory Persistence Model, which allows them to write out the state of any of the Star Hashes to a local cache, whenever they're streamed out. This allows them to test game code such as the mission system, the transit system, service beacons, etc. to see what breaks whenever they start streaming things in and out of the game server.<br />Due to how significantly they're changing the way the game works, they have to revisit the existing game features to make sure they aren't broken, and to fix them in places that they are, which Chad says they've done. The next big things for them to do are to implement the real backend for persistence, which requires rewriting the way that the game writes out to persistence, and to the backend, the cloud services that handle that data so that they're much better at handling much higher loads - this is necessary because there's already a large amount of persistence data in the game right now, due to persisting Players and ships and items, and this is changed all the time by things like flying around and using fuel, or when something breaks off your ship, but Global Persistence means they're looking at persisting the whole universe for all of the game servers and for the whole game, so there's a much higher volume of data to deal with, thus requiring a really big set of changes on the backend to handle that. This work is a work in progress that continues.<br />The last big thing (and he adds that there's a lot of little details too but he's covering the big-ticket items) is the game code changes that need to happen, meaning they need all of the game feature teams to revisit their features and make sure they're not broken, which is a big effort. As such, until they start testing heavily, they won't even know of all the work that they're going to have to do, so there's a lot of unknown unknowns. Chad sees the progress they've made so far this year as good, but says however that one particularly positive thing that they've figured out is that their Prototype In-Memory Persistence Model seems to be working very well, so they're considering phasing out SSOCS, so that it doesn't need Global Persistence the first time they ship it. This means that they ship it in such a way that if a server goes down, then its state is lost, but Player state isn't lost, so from the Player's perspective the game won't have changed, but it does mean that they can add in some of the streaming benefits without yet having the Global Persistence benefits, which will be released once they've finished that work. As such, a part of SSOCS could end up on a more accelerated release schedule than they maybe anticipated.<br />Moving on to Server Meshing, it's something that has also been a long time in the making. The Net Bind Culling and Serialised Variables that were mentioned earlier were a prerequisite for Server Meshing. Similar to SSOCS they have begun significant planning and work on the feature, however SSOCS is a hard requirement for Server Meshing. This means that even whilst they can make progress on Server Meshing, because most of the work for Server Meshing falls on the network team with support from the core engine and game code teams (whereas SSOCS is mainly the opposite with the addition of backend services), they can do some work in parallel but they can't deploy it in full until SSOCS is done because it's a prerequisite - it's how Server Meshing fundamentally works - so it'll come after SSOCS for sure.", "published_at": "2019-09-06", "title": "Star Citizen Live: All About Development", "source": "https://youtu.be/wENuiIcPK10", "transcript": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/d1e27o/a_summary_of_star_citizen_live_all_about/", "type": "youtube", "time": "21m10s", "published_at_timestamp": 1567797154}, {"objectID": "490ed8b4ad4ec_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Currently, the Ballista needs to be taken back to an outpost, where it can be repaired and rearmed.

This is a very very difficult question. Generally the leads of each of the teams are aware of what they need their team to do, we meet frequently ,we do weekly goals, we have a master schedule that were trying to drive the long term of things, we're' trying to get all the ideas out of chris's head, we trying to put it all in one place put it all together, very much on the production side that doesn't burden you guys at all, you guys keep making awesome stuff. But then we do have constant priority clashing. Forrest and I have been experiencing this a lot lately because it's the same resources doing multiple different things.Forrest Stephan: Because we know we all need to get it done and that's when you know if you have two leads that want to both to get something done it kind of clashes that's when you raise it up to production and that's why I like Eric here to help make the decision on what does come first and it's not a boxing match it's actually a steel cage match[Everyone laughs]FS: You have the top with the ladder, you put tacks all over the groundEKD: I think the perfect example right, let's use something very realistic to now that Forrest and I just talked about. The amazingly wildly talented Mark Mcall, upstairs right.FS: He can do technical ships and do technical animations for characters.EKD: He's excellent at everything he does and so that means everyone wants him and wants to use him for things, that's a frequent conversations between Forrest and I the design leads, whos' going to use mark for what this week and what's the long term thing so we're constantly battling the, we got the long term vision but we got the short term things we need to achieve, so when events come up and it's already tech that we've been developing and were about to show it off to so we can keep going, we're shifting things around frequently and we're all tense.So we're all trying to get things done and everyone wants to use the same person and so, there's aggressive conversations but it's generally healthy, it's usually for getting the the thing done, we all want to get this thing done and make it awesome, make it look great and we all try to drive for our peace, that's usually how it works, but then at the end of the day the leads or people who are leaders of  places or points of contact need to work together, alright I'll give him up to you for this week but this means that will mean this this and this for the schedule and so that kind of comes down to where like you said work with production, look at the long term with all of our studios global, it's a complex little beast.FS: and there's also the director's role you know and if the leads have a clash on what the priorities are because they both want their own individual disciplines to have priorities and then it gets raised up to the directors who can kind of work things out.EKD: And then ultimately Chris. We present that to Chris and say hey the directors agree with this, the production agrees with this, this is the what the team wants to do, Chris which way should we go? I think he does a great job at kind of seeing this whole somehow, seeing this massive thing and going let's put this there , there and there, it's a big puzzle.Calix Reneau: Star Citizen is an experience and it's a very unique one, it's driven by the things that you can do and the places you can do it and so that means that we have art and design and programming all these things really need to add up to the star citizen experience that Chris's vision is for. On a given thing that balance might skew differently because, also at a given time because you know, sometimes it's really easy to get something functional but ugly, sometimes it's very easy to get something pretty but not functional and then we fill in the rest right? and it comes back to what what were talking earlier about context of  get as much of the thing so that that informs decisions and informs the thing that you're creating and when the thing exists you can say Yes that is right or no that needs to be a little bit different and for these reasons, that continues to build upon itself into a real thing.

Will I be able to visit planetside areas such as Arc Corp where I am the only one not an NPC, or go into the larger universe offline where it's just me and an NPC world?", "answer": "So currently we don't have any plans for an offline version of star citizen mainly because we have so many parts that revolve around a huge simulated universe. so the only way we make this universe feel alive is because we have a detailed simulation running 20 million AI on a server that communicates with game servers and our solar system servers and that's not practical on a single player mode. So you know since squadron 42 is your single player game and then star citizen is multiplayer, either it's sort of Massively multiplayer online using our whole infrastructure, which scales and can handle you know lots of players millions of players or there is the private server option which we're going to do which will be after the squadron 42 and the massively online stuff is all up and running. but the private one will be more akin to the way freelancer works where you can run your own server. you definitely wont be able to have millions of people on it and probably wouldn't be 1000's. but it would be more sort of like freelancer with 100 or so it would be server stood up that you and your friends or whatever could match into and go around and the universe would be more static than it would be in the sort of vastly massively multiplayer simulated one because we got a lot more servers and computing power in the cloud and were sort of doing things that of kind of similar to what people have been talking about what the cloud can do for you, where you can put a lot more of the simulation up in the cloud and make the world richer so you know that unfortunately makes the single player game in a sort of Freelancer way style, privateer style, much harder to achieve, I mean we  probably could do a dumbed down more simpler version of the universe and it would look great and have lots of  cool stuff it just wouldn't be quite as dynamic but that's not currently on the plans you don't know whether or not maybe we'll do that in the future, but currently that's not on the development plans.", "published_at": "2015-09-21", "title": "10 For the Chairman: Episode 67", "source": "https://youtu.be/yLjk2UvfFRA", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Priscilla", "published_at_timestamp": 1442872931}, {"objectID": "373681390", "question": "Will there will be integration or support for the new Steam controller that is coming out later this year?", "answer": "Well... if Valve send me it.

So maybe I need to rattle their cage a little bit. But yeah if we got a Steam controller we would be happy to hook it up and make sure it works in Star Citizen.

So in the case of the vanguard I went to a designer, Calix R, and he replied that there will be a button to toggle whether you want the wings to deploy on the vanguard. On the wing-tips there are thrusters though, so if you want to go really fast, you could swing the wings back to point the thrusters rear-ward to go quicker, but if you want manoeuvrability when they're fully deployed, there is more \"leverage\" so the craft can change direction more quickly, but it does increase your cross-sectional signature, so more susceptible to getting hit, though increasing your axial rotation.", "published_at": "2015-04-20", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 05 (2015.04.20)", "source": "https://youtu.be/YJeaYs_U-Mg", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "RadiantFlux", "published_at_timestamp": 1429567111}, {"objectID": "373676620", "question": "Back in earlier days there was talk of multiple game packages being able to be turned into NPCs that you could use as crew. There was mention in the Town Hall that there will not be permanently hireable NPC.

You can define those characters and their roles etc. If you're not playing your character, and it's appropriate for that character to be crew for you, say I'm a pilot and I've got my Han Solo character and my Chewie character, both defined and they both live on Terra, then when I got into the Millennium Falcon as Han, Chewbacca could very well be my co-pilot. Now I could log on next time and play as Chewbacca and Han would be my NPC, but in the case where you have NPCs play roles on your ship, there will be costs involved. Maybe we'll have some kind of change where they might not need as much for the player owned ones, but we haven't worked that out yet. The advantage of the player owned NPCs is that you might have the whole crew of your ship customised to however you want them to be, looks, character traits etc etc, and you can play any one of those that you want. Generally NPCs you will pay a wage, with potential exceptions for players that you own, but you've got to appreciate that Chewie still wants a share of the spoils!", "published_at": "2015-02-16", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 53 (2015.02.16)", "source": "https://youtu.be/N2K1CH22SF8", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Mandulis", "published_at_timestamp": 1424127628, "time": "22m39s"}, {"objectID": "373676990", "question": "Do you plan on any of the larger ships, i.e. the Starfarer or Carrack, to be hangar ready in 2015?", "answer": "Starfarer I'd say yes, I don't know about the Carrack, I'd have to check our ship schedule. The SF is definitely a yes as it's one of the ships that is being worked on now and has a place in SQ42, which is out this year, so it obviously has to be finished for hangars and flight before that. Our biggest challenge with other ships like the Carrack is the sheer amount of work that has to go into making them and getting them ready for Hangars and flight. We're hiring, any great 3D hard modellers out there get us a yell, we're ramping up our UK branch with those positions too. We had a ship summit very recently, where we sorted out not only the plan for which ships go where and how to build them, but we have a whole technique now for building the bigger ships with the retaliator as a prototype. We're sorting out ways to make them look like pre-rendered assets while being rendered real-time. The retaliator is a prototype for not only multi-crew functionality but for much more stuff we look for in the bigger ships.

I don't think we're really considering transporting ships broken down to their component parts. Which is I guess how it's done in the real world. So if you wanted to bring some Hornets to sell, you'd probably have to load them into a ship that can fit them or hire some crew to fly them for you to the location you want to take them.

Will it be possible to beseige planets and space stations? Cutting them off from resources, driving up the value of those items to force the planet to go into recession or make a claimable space station inhabitable by say blockading it from needed supplies like food, water and O2?", "answer": "Most planets have instanced space around them, it's not unique. So if there's a planet and you got 50 people in orbit and our limit is 50 people per instance, the 51st and 52nd player that enter that orbit get put into a second instance around the planet again, they just don't see the other 50 people etc etc. So unless the space around the planet/station is unique doing a full blockade would be very difficult or impossible. There are some places that might have a unique instance of space around them, so if you did do it here, the way the game works is that if you did destroy every cargo ship going into that station it'd have an effect, but there would probably still be some that got through, and maybe even another instance \"opened\" for the NPC ships. Even in a player instanced scenario, if you destroy a cargo ship, that information goes into our economy system and it says well, those goods didn't get to the planet so in general the prices would rise for those goods, so while yes you do have an effect, you probably won't be able to entirely blockade a station like that.

So we're definitely gonna have a bit of variety, and sort of go from there. I mean, the only one caveat with the sort of two-star systems is handling the lighting situation out in space, 'cause CryEngine is sort of built with the assumption of one sun, and so we'd have to have the second one as a separate sort of light, but that's definitely handle-able.", "published_at": "2014-08-25", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 35 (2014.08.25)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Uyur8rqbEHc", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Coldgas", "published_at_timestamp": 1409004035}, {"objectID": "373683910", "question": "With all the excitement around DFM, I am personally more interested in the Galactapedia.Do you have an estimated date on when the subscribers can begin updating / editing / reviewing the information there?I really want to start reading up more on the lore.", "answer": "I don't really have a good date for you.

We're doing some really cool stuff, it's definitely something you'll want to have in your hangar.

I mean it's a difficult question to ask on the asteroid hangar because that's a very distinct thing, and it's more in a different location than say a business or a deluxe hangar.So I guess my question would be, not my question, my answer would be:We haven't made the decision on that yet, but that is a good point.So I take that off and be thinking about how to make that equitable without having someone buying 20 packages and snapping up a bunch of real-estate that they can put all around the universe. Because that would sort of defeat part of the purpose of getting people to play because actually being able to get a hangar and all the rest of the stuff should take some work to achieve and I don't want everyone to suddenly be 100% fully set up.So it's a good question, I will think about that, but I don't have a good answer for you right now.
