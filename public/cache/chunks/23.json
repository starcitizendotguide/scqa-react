Common characteristics of S-pop include the incorporation of relaxing organic-sourced sounds and traditional Saisei instruments. The term can refer either specifically to the popular music of Saisei or to any music functionally derived therefrom. </p><br/><h1>ORIGIN</h1><br/><p>The earliest iteration of traditional Saisei music evolved in the 25th century, when Saisei was first established and built up as a colony world. The form owes a significant amount to the slow, methodical process involved in planning and constructing Saisei colony. While typical colonies grow in fits as interest in particular exports drive commerce and immigration, Seisei was instead built up deliberately according to a long-term plan. Lacking the booms and busts of traditional early colonial development that leave newly settled worlds more closely tied to a home culture, Saisei developed its own disparate takes on a variety of Human art forms. </p><br/><p>During the initial settlement period, luxury imports from Earth (Sol III) were extremely limited. As a result, traditional Human instruments were uncommon beyond those carried as part of the first wave's personal preference kits. Colonists turned to local materials to develop their own offshoots. Trees seeded during the early terraforming process produced softer wood than is traditionally used to create stringed instruments. This limitation ultimately gave rise to the Saisei-made softwood guitar, or s-guitar, which produces a mellower, more resonant sound than its Earth-made equivalent. </p><br/><p>Saisei musicians soon began experimenting with natural sounds. By the middle of the 27th century, a typical Saisei arrangement might include several dozen different natural samples, often arrayed so elaborately that their source could not be externally determined. </p><br/><h1>WIDESPREAD POPULARITY</h1><br/><p>For roughly four hundred years, Saisei traditional music was not widespread beyond the Centauri system. That changed in 2932 when Saisei-based band The Claw appeared on Terra, Show Me the Music!, a popular Spectrum-based showcase for aspiring bands. Instead of performing an original song, The Claw chose to perform a Saisei-styled interpretation of Clover's \"Moonlight,\" then at the height of its popularity. The group used a traditional s-guitar and an array of cultivated aquatic insect sounds to give the song what the series' host termed \"eerie, still movement.\" The performance was accompanied by a holographic light show based in traditional Saisei culture. </p><br/><p>In under two weeks, The Claw had the number one single on popular music charts of both Earth and Terra (Terra III). Viewers initially curious about the light show and the unusual sounds became interested in the music itself. The Terra Gazette dubbed this style of music S-pop. A brief S-pop craze followed The Claw's larger UEE debut with music producers rushing to sign hitherto unknown acts from Saisei and other performers around the galaxy eager to emulate what they considered an exciting new discovery. </p><br/><p>S-pop ruled Spectrum from November 2932 to December 2934 with dozens of songs taking top positions. Although interest in S-pop has waxed and waned in the ensuing years, the impact of the fad has had permanence.

Initially founded as a bar in 2520 by the Wilkes family, Radegast became a common stopover point once word spread about the house whiskey they produced in the back. Its popularity grew to the point where a full-size distillery was added in 2574.<br/><p>Both bar and distillery were purchased from the Wilkes family by the Pan-Galactic Beverage Corporation (PGBC) in 2602. Radegast enjoyed 300 years of galactic success before falling out of the public eye in the early 29th century. In 2920, the brand underwent a resurgence when a private investor bought and rebuilt the original bar in the style of the 26th century. Today, Radegast is consistently ranked as one of the biggest sellers of Martian Whiskey in the UEE.</p><br/><h1>History</h1><br/><p>Dimitri and Danica Wilkes, eldest children of a second-generation Mars-born family, opened Radegast Bar in 2520. The bar saw early popularity among the Port Renatus locals, winning Most Welcoming Bar/Restaurant in a 2532 edition of Mars Today. Dimitri used the storage room (and his regulars) to experiment with home-brewing. He tried several unsuccessful beer recipes and made a notorious attempt at distilling gin, before finally trying his hand at whiskey. The recipe was an instant hit, catapulting the bar to even greater heights of popularity. Eventually, the Wilkes siblings retired on their profits and passed the bar down to their children.</p><br/><p>In 2574, Danica\u2019s granddaughter added a permanent distillery to the family operation. Zara Wilkes\u2019 house whiskey, Radegast Gold, gained a wide-reaching reputation for smoothness and clarity of flavor. Radegast Distilleries opened a second facility on Angeli, Croshaw in 2585. The first untapped casks of Angeli whiskey were shipped to Port Renatus in 2598. The journey unexpectedly, but pleasantly, changed the Whiskey\u2019s flavour, prompting the launch of Radegast Homeward. This limited release was stored in Angeli oak barrels, but matured in zero-G, before returning to Mars for its final aging.</p><br/><p>The company\u2019s success drove the Pan-Galactic Beverage Corporation (PGBC) to make an offer to buy the Radegast name, whiskey, and bar in the late 26th century. The Wilkes family wanted to make sure that the label stayed under their control, so a formal sale wasn\u2019t finalized until 2602. With the added benefit of PGBC\u2019s production and distribution network, Radegast whiskey began to appear in all corners of the UEE.</p><br/><h1>Decline</h1><br/><p>The last member of the Wilkes family left the Radegast brand in 2754, citing personal differences with the leadership of PGBC. This ended 180 years of Wilkes-led distillation of Radegast whiskey, as well as PGBC\u2019s access to the Wilkes-owned water source on Mars, Perepllut\u2019s Well. However, PGBC retained the rights to the Radegast name, and began selling a low-cost version of its Gold whiskey in 2766. Their first attempt at a new recipe, Radegast Neo, was appallingly received.</p><br/><p>In the early 2800s, PGBC came under fire after they were accused of diluting Radegast Gold and passing it off as full strength. The company denied the accusations. However, the scandal repeated throughout the 2810s, finally reaching its climax in 2821 when evidence was published on Spectrum by independent investigator Willis Kemper. The Radegast brand was unable to maintain its reputation, and while the high-end limited editions were still considered top quality whiskeys, sales plummeted.</p><br/><h1>Revival</h1><br/><p>PGBC dissolved in 2918, and with it, their right to the Radegast name. A private investor purchased the brand and the building where the original bar once operated. Two years later, the newly rebuilt Radegast bar reopened, rebuilt to look as it did in the 26th century.</p><br/><p>Descendants of the Wilkes family were hired to distill classic versions of their whiskey from the original recipes crafted by Dimitri and Zara. The new Radegast whiskeys soon grew in reputation, and the brand was reborn.

We will try to steer players in a certain direction due to the design and tuning values but whether it works cannot even been properly evaluated with experimental modes (which we had online for MM for two whole releases) ... it can only be seen once we playtest it with a wide user base that has very different capabilities, hardware equipment and play styles.<br/><br/>And this is exactly what we're doing right now by pushing the changes out to 3.23.<br/>@Alfred_North, I think the reason why you ask your question is because you're unhappy with the current state and polish of the features. And you know what ... I would agree! :slightly_smiling_face:<br/><br/>Going a bit further on this from my dev POV it was extremely important to get all the SQ42 tech concerning master modes, aiming, ship re-tunings, etc. into 3.23. Doing this all in one quarter was \"very\" challenging and we said multiple times that 3.23. won't be the combat Jesus patch and that there should not be an expectation of a perfectly balanced game. It was just too much content for the team size we have. So while there is a certain risk to push a feature out early, the simple truth here is that it also saves time further down the line. First of all the features get a lot of exposure to players which gives us way more feedback and useful game analytics. Second it saves internally a lot of maintenance time as we don't need to care anymore about the legacy systems. So we opted for the variant to be bold and get the stuff into player hands earlier than keeping to develop it without feedback.<br/><br/>So ... based on that I am summing up my own feelings like this:<br/>- I am VERY HAPPY with the progress of MM in 3.23. and I think it is good enough state to offer a better gameplay experience compared to 3.22. It was a huge challenge to pull all that tech into the PU and most of the ships are now in a better relationship to each other (specifically in group fights)<br/>- I am NOT HAPPY with the overall state of MM (or shall we say the flight and combat experience) as we've not hit all the markers we wanted to hit.<br/><br/>And just to make it clear that we hear players, here are some of the issues we'd  like to approach. Some of them are from our own lists, others come directly from player feedback, some from both ... in no particular order:<br/><br/>- Snubs fighters are not really where they need to be<br/>- LFs are now too weak<br/>- 1v1 dogfights are lacking<br/>- Ability to evade shots<br/>- Adding jerk back into IFCS<br/>- Trying out an egg-shaped velocity space to suppress back strafing<br/>- Iterating on the AI to make it hit less perfect when we want<br/>- Teaching the AI not to over-rely on back-strafing<br/>- iterating on the NAV-SCM spool times<br/>- ESP not being as good as it needs to be<br/>- Turret ESP being somewhat wacky on sticks<br/>- make the piloting combat less about aim and more about flight<br/>- Aiming system networking not performing well enough<br/>- Issues with certain mining and salvaging ships not being able to use gimbals from cockpit seats<br/>- Issues with g-force zoom effects being inconsistent<br/>- Specific ship tunings that feel out of whack (e.g. Redeemer, Sabre, etc.)<br/>- Iterating with the speed walls and ship tunings in general<br/>- Missiles flying way too fast for MM tuning<br/>- Integration of the flight mechanics and combat geometry with RN<br/><br/>So as you can see there is a lot of stuff related to the flight and combat experience that needs to be addressed. Once that has happened we might consider making a video. But that point is not now. And even when we reach it, I'd still say that our content creators will do a much better job than us bunch of devs working on flight and combat.<br/><br/>Hope that makes sense :slightly_smiling_face:", "user": "Alfred_North", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/3/thread/request-for-yogi-can-you-make-a-video-to-show-us-w/6818844", "published_at_timestamp": 1714983912, "title": "Spectrum", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "1c9526a6e9e07c_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "There are individual personal lockers/storage and a shared weapon rack storing items.

Additionally, working for one mission giver could cause the Player to accrue negative rep' with another mission giver who's opposed to the former. Luke references a question asking about the P.I. Wanted mission, and whether they'll create more missions like that. He says that's the closest he can think of to a \"story mission\" and that even that mission is quite basic, but they'd really like to take the notion of there being a big story arc existing within that station (Covalex, which orbits Crusader's moon Cellin I think? They might've moved it; I haven't been their for a while), where you go to it to do that one thing, but on the way the Player finds multiple smaller story arcs, and then once the main mission is done, they've actually unlocked more procedural missions - this makes it so that a location isn't built just for one specific mission. He adds that Elliot's been looking into what they can do to maybe take something like the P.I. Wanted mission and use it as a basis [for other missions], and learn more about the Building Blocks and what they can do there. Elliot expands on this, saying that they wanted to make more of a web so that it can be harder for the Player, but if they have good investigation skills \"they'll be able to hopefully find it\". They want to include extra things, such as when you're doing the mission and you're finding info, you could get contacted by someone requesting that certain people get \"thrown under the bus\" and they'll pay the Player more for that, thus creating moral choices and dilemmas. They're also looking at other ways it can be improved, because right now they have data-pads floating about, and they're looking at systems they can use to make the mission more immersive for Players (so in-world things, like email systems). Luke adds that they want to give the Players enough information for them to go through and figure things out, and also allow Players to decide which information is handed-in at the end, which would allow for those situations where maybe an NPC contacted the Player saying \"make this person look guilty\" or the opposite, and the Player can then release information from their investigation that shows that, or not.", "time": "10m57s", "published_at_timestamp": 1564772763}, {"objectID": "947639300", "title": "Calling All Devs - Mr. Steal Yo Data", "question": "When will we hear anything about the RSI Lynx rover?", "source": "https://youtu.be/op7tLkJaTN4", "type": "youtube", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "time": "10m42s", "answer": "", "published_at_timestamp": 1537819156}, {"objectID": "947638860", "title": "Calling All Devs - Calling All Papys, Part I", "question": "What is the status of moving ships from a 100% chance of a canned explosive death that kills everyone aboard to rendering ships inoperable through phyiscal or energy damage without all the colorful explosions?", "source": "https://youtu.be/1I2XuEdu-1I", "type": "youtube", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "time": "3m53s", "answer": "", "published_at_timestamp": 1531765622}, {"objectID": "1e67522c5098c_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "While the 100 series share a lot of their features, the 100i will have a better maneuverability than the cargo variant.

If so, I\u2019m curious about how long the process takes to model an in-game render of someone\u2019s face? ", "answer": "CR: So I guess they\u2019re trying to qualify the question that we asked when we were soliciting these awhile back. For what we do we always, currently anyway, we don\u2019t model it just from scratch artistically. We scan a person, an actor, fully. We have a whole rig of 50 plus cameras that go around the head, and we, essentially use photogrammetry to digitize and take a 3D snapshot of both the geometry or the sort of 3D mesh of the head as well as what the face textures would be. Then we take that, and we do a lot to it after that. So I don\u2019t know if you want to talk a little bit about that.<br /><br />JH: Yeah after that we kind of\u2026 Especially for the some of the main actors who do full facial capture so they\u2019re getting blend shapes on specific ways that they talk. So that adds a whole another kind of layer. So that\u2019s a really difficult thing to do if you\u2019re just going to be sculpting a head from scratch, \u2019cause I think our characters have like some other upwards of 400 blend shapes.<br /><br />CR: Yep. Over 400 blend shapes.<br /><br />JH: So that would be 400 individual sculpts that we would need to make to match what we\u2019re doing. So that\u2019s really not an approach that we would want to be taking to get the realism that we want, especially for that actress that we have.<br /><br />CR: We work with a \u2026 there\u2019s a company called 3Lateral who are sort of quite well known for their headrig and head animation technology and sort of pushing forward the field of scanning live, real people and bringing them into the 3D world. We\u2019ve been working with them for quite awhile. They\u2019ve also in the past, you know they did Rise, for instance, back for CryoTech which is in the CryEngine,  and our headrig, of the headrigs out there, is you know we\u2019ll talk to it in a bit, but the by far the highest fidelity \u2026<br /><br />JH: Yep.<br /><br />CR: \u2026 headrig that they\u2019ve done. I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s probably higher fidelity or up there with anyone else\u2019s headrig, but you know so it\u2019s a big process. So if you go in and do a full set, an actor will set in this whole scanning set up and we will take 78 facial poses for them. So you know it\u2019s sort of like things kind of like you [Scrunches Nose] scrunch your nose, or [Raises Eyebrow] raise an eyebrow \u2026<br /><br />JH: [Makes Faces]<br /><br />CR: \u2026 [Opens Mouth & Sticks Out Tongue] opens mouth. And you have to do that and each one takes about a minute to collect all the data from all the cameras, builds it on the computer, and you then take another one and you do it. So it can take anywhere depending on how quick or slow the person in the seat is, an hour to two hours to do the full 78 pose set, and that builds and that basically gets built down by a lot of the techniques that 3Lateral are doing to this sort of 300 pose, blendshape setup and then of course on top of the 400 pose blend shapes. I think about 440 actually for our higher tier characters. It also has bones underneath that like, I think it\u2019s something like 175 joints.<br /><br />JH: Yeah, and that also drives specific maps so when they are doing those specific faces, [Wrinkles Forehead] like the forehead, it drives wrinkle maps and animated diffused maps for our higher influence as well.<br /><br />CR: So it\u2019s not just blend shapes, \u2026<br /><br />JH: Yeah.<br /><br />CR: \u2026 it\u2019s not just bones, it\u2019s a wrinkle map which is sort of telling the shader kind of what parts of the skin. So that\u2019s almost like \u2026<br /><br />JH: Yeah. [Wrinkles Forehead]<br /><br />CR: \u2026 like a bump \u2026<br /><br />JH: Like the wrinkle information you see here.<br /><br />CR: \u2026 yeah almost like it\u2019s a bump map and then the animated diffuse is sort of showing like how your color changes in your skin when you scrunch something up \u2026<br /><br />JH: Yep. Maybe you\u2019ll get a red or a white. Yep.<br /><br />CR: \u2026 Maybe you\u2019ll get white or maybe you\u2019ll get red or whatever it will be. It\u2019s a pretty long process but after even doing that we bring it in and then we actually do sort of an artistic pass.<br /><br />JH: Yeah, kind of like a makeup polish, polish or a makeup pass in a way, \u2019cause a lot of when you see those actors getting scanned it\u2019s, you know. You usually have to scrub their face and so you can get these dots and you get really accurate information of what they look like, but that\u2019s also not what they would look like on the a film set, because they don\u2019t have makeup, and you know when you go and film sometimes. Most of the times you have like a very specific people that just do that. Right?<br /><br />CR: Yeah, you don\u2019t look like \u2026 you don\u2019t look like you woke up in the morning.<br /><br />JH: Exactly.<br /><br />CR: Everyone makes you up to look really great in a film \u2026<br /><br />JH: Yeah.<br /><br />CR: \u2026 light you properly, and so when we actually scan the actors we don\u2019t want any makeup on them, because it\u2019s best for how they sort of build the 3D head.<br /><br />JH: Exactly.<br /><br />CR: So then we have this process that we bring, the head in and then we sort of do our own sort of makeup pass on the character and set it up in such a way that they\u2019re going to look like a movie star playing \u2026 running around in our 3D world. So that\u2019s part of our process. So we do all of this kind of assembling of the data that we scanned and then we bring it in here and do our own pass on top of it \u2026<br /><br />JH: Yep.<br /><br />CR: \u2026 to sort of take it up to the extra level. We really work on things like the eyes, the tongue, the teeth.<br /><br />JH: Eyes. Yep.<br /><br />CR: And we still have a whole bunch of additional graphics work to be done. So the eye shader is going to get a lot more work.<br /><br />JH: The hair shader.<br /><br />CR: The hair shader is a big one, so that\u2019s our probably weakest point now. So a lot of the images you\u2019ll be seeing during this 10 For the Chairman, we don\u2019t have what our intended hair shader is going to be, but our hair shader is going to be to the level of the best hair shaders you\u2019ve seen out there in real time games, and then we\u2019ll also work a little on the skin shader too. So, our goal is to sort of when the characters, you know when you play Squadron 42 for instance, the level of character tech and visual level will be as good or better than anything out there. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re shooting for. We\u2019re working really hard on it. We\u2019ve got a lot of talented people working on it. We\u2019re not there yet, but I think you\u2019ll be seeing in this particular episode sort of some stuff along the way, and it\u2019s only just going to get better.", "title": "Star Citizen: 10 for the Chairman - Special Edition", "source": "https://youtu.be/I2SBYtj9pis", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Hearts", "time": "5m51s", "published_at_timestamp": 1474502281}, {"objectID": "2e0b8e77c3583_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The Dragonfly will have limited on-board HUD displays with more information able to be fed directly to the users helmet.", "published_at_timestamp": 1466719200, "question": "Will the Dragonfly have a HUD like current ships, or will it perhaps use some 30th century version of Bluetooth, to feed that information to the mobiGlas augmented reality?", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/15390-Q-A-Drake-Dragonfly-Part-II", "title": "Q&A: Drake Dragonfly - Part II", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "373673750", "question": "How do you think working with Chris Roberts to make Star Citizen would be different and/or the same if you had worked with Chris on a Wing Commander game?", "answer": "Ben Lesnick: That's an interesting question. So I've worked a little bit on lore for old Wing Commander games. I did all the lore for the XBox live arcade game, I helped edit some of the novels and stuff. I find going back, that I don't take myself seriously. I look back and go \"Okay. Wing Commander is amazing, I love Wing Commander, I love everything about the universe. This is the part Ben came up with... I don't know about that! What was I thinking?\" It's actually kind of been good to be doing Star Citizen, where it's this new thing that I get to see developed, and I have a part in that I, don't know, I find that it gives me more buy in.If I were working on a Wing Commander game, I would be an obsessive crazy person about continuity and just very argumentative probably. It's a good thing we're doing Star Citizen. I'm actually more curious about you, because you have so much more... so much more of the lore is yours, and you look at that and see, \"Hey, there's Dave Haddock in writing form.\" How do you feel about that?Dave Haddock: I mean it's awesome and, you know, people seem to really like it, but again it's not just me. There's so many aspects of the universe that, when we were doing early conversations in the Kickstarter thing that we were talking about, that have... like you guys, I haven't touched ships. You guys came up with all the ships and all the awesome... I mean I still, like the Retaliator to me is just a work of art.BL: Which is interesting because, you know, I look at the ships and like, \"Oh my God! I can't believe I got to do this\". I got to work with these incredibly talented people that come up with this, there's a little bit of me in there. But I look at a ship that I did on Wing Commander Arena. I did a similar thing, I named all the ships, I did all the specs, I came up with their backstories, and I'm like, \"Oh those are embarrassing\". They're not as good as the other Wing Commander ships.DH: But no, I mean yeah, it's been awesome. But yeah, there so many... I mean everybody contributes, and that's kind of, one of the fun things about the company is that there's a lot of... everybody banding together and coming up with cool stuff.

The reason why we're continuing to concept ships now is because the whole idea is with the universe, especially once its up and running, it's going to be like the real world. There will be different... new models of ships coming out, and new variations and things for people to earn money towards so they can buy this new ship that comes out or buy this new gun or buy a little piece of real estate. Everyone needs goals for the game and so we want to keep a constant supply of ships and weapons and other features for people to work towards acquiring and then use in the game.So, we really need to keep the pipeline going so there's been a few cases where we've just stopped on the pipeline and then it kind of dried up for a while which isn't a good thing.So you'll see now that we're pretty steadily delivering ships into the hangar and delivering ships into a flyable state because we have a pretty large team of 3D modelers, technical artists all working on the ships and technical designers all setting them up.The concept side is the front end of that pipeline so we're continuing to flesh out the various ships that we think we want in the ecosystem because you want to fly around in the universe of Star Citizen and it should feel like a busy, alive universe with variety and all sorts of things. Whether it's ships or equipment you can use or even races, we want to make it teeming and real and it's been there for hundreds, millions of years.It should feel like a living, breathing universe so as part of that we need to complete pipeline to carry on because right now if we don't do some of the concepts by the time some of the modelers have finished they won't have new stuff to roll onto. So, that's kind of the plan that is encompassed, and so we continue to work on some of the concept stuff to make sure that we have a pipeline and some of the ships may be not in the hangar right now are already in process in the background with the modeling team.That is why - to maintain the pipeline. Because our goal is to basically to constantly be adding content, even when the game is what we would consider \"live release\" or whatever, we will constantly be adding all sorts of things to it. So content in terms of ships and equipment, clothes, characters, missions, star systems, all those sort of things... and functionality and features we'll continue to add. Part of that is ships which is why you have concepts happening as well as the modeling. So, \"different folks - one isn't blocking the other,\" I guess would be the easy way to answer that.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 82", "source": "https://youtu.be/3stBTV7QZzk", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Ethnine", "published_at_timestamp": 1460414681}, {"objectID": "373675000", "question": "How will reconnaissance work, aside from relaying information through chat? Will there be in-game methods for ships to mark targets either physically or electronically? Will there be any value in sending ships or players as operatives in advance of an attacking force?", "answer": "So, absolutely, yes, there will be in-game methods for marking ships. I think I talked a long time ago and mentioned quite a few times about sort of the \"person of interest\", and really \"person of interest\", \"point of interest\" kind of gameplay where you would sort of tag a ship or tag an individual and you say \"yes, I'm interested in them\". You could maybe say \"Yes, I'm marking this person for my friends to follow\" or you are going to say \"Yes, meet me at this location\" and tag this location and beam it to your friends.So, definitely having someone out there sort of being sort of the eyes and relaying information to other players cooperatively would be a big part of gameplay and I think, you know, it will fall very much in line of what I think makes Star Citizen special, 'cause I really sort of feel, and it's kind of cool watching you know, all the people streaming 2.1 and 2.2 and videos people have made where you really, the &acirc;&euro;&ldquo;some of the coolest stuff is people working with each other to do  things, you know. Helping each other out, rescuing someone, you know, working in unison to fly a bigger ship, and of course I mention this all the time, but those are things that are very high on the list to make sure, you know, all the full functionality is there for it 'cause we're still missing a bunch on the multi-crew functionality and the seats, and all the rest of stuff, which is being worked on as I speak.But, you know, the cooperative nature of the gameplay is really important for us, and obviously reconnaissance, and calling out targets, and all that would be part of it.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 79", "source": "https://youtu.be/7sCTnlihzEY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Zilch", "published_at_timestamp": 1457991105}, {"objectID": "373675370", "question": "Elite recently implemented the PowerPlay feature which allows players a means of enacting change within the galaxy.

Do you anticipate similar problems arising in SC with the PvP slider?", "answer": "Matt Sherman: We're hoping not. So any of the actions that you're taking in the persistent universe are... it's going to be something you were there to have to trigger off at some point. So, it's not like there would be any sort of passive offline gameplay. But there could definitely be something where hey you've brought some good materials to a fabrication site, they may be pumping out some better components for a little bit of time. And that... those could still be for sale while you're offline. But it's something that you triggered, that you helped cause in the universe. And that should really affect everyone regardless of PvE or PvP. Because, just because you have your slider set one way or another, it doesn't mean you can't get attacked. There can be PvE pirates, there can be PvP UEE cops.Calix Reneau: Yeah, it's not just about the PvP, the PvE conflict either. Because PvP actions and things that... anything that influences the persistent universe to a greater degree than shooting a guy is going to require some level of interaction with NPCs. Either as to the farthest extreme, simply as witnesses, where the NPCs are being affected by all of your decisions. And as such whether a player is there or not, the NPCs will continue to be affected by those decisions when you come into effect your change. So any change in state to the environment is going to be propagated across. Additionally if you're going to be doing anything like a blockade or something you're gonna want to be teaming up with the local NPCs. Because that's... if I come to this factory to drop off my stuff a blockade is going to require that that factory be run by NPCs with your interests in mind rather than mine. That's how generally I would expect things to play out. And if.. you were able to discover a way to.. effect the persistent universe without really putting yourself in risk of player interference, that's why the PvP slider doesn't go to zero.MS: Yeah.CR: We're able to give different levels of weight to different players depending on.. how much we think that their influence should be making them available as parts. The slider is an issue of player intent, it doesn't guarantee a particular kind of experience.MS: Yeah. I mean you could get nothing but NPCs on the full PvP slider and you can still get jumped by other players on the full PvE slide too. It's just where you are, what you're doing, what you've caused to happen.

Is there any downside to publishing new patches so frequently?", "answer": "Well I think the only downside is that we spend a lot of money on CDN costs. Every time we push 30 gigs to thousands of players we're paying for all that data bandwidth getting pushed down from our CDN provider who is Amazon AWS.So that is kind of the down side but the upside is we get much better turn around and iteration. We were looking at the stats and the last PTU build, before we went to live, compare to the first PTU build was over 100 times more stable than the first one. Which is a pretty massive change in a fairly short period of time. And a lot of that was because we had a large group of players stress testing in a way that we just can do internally. Currently we have 24, 25 QA between the UK and the US which is not a small amount of QA but on a game this big it's really hard to cover all the features and stress test it. But when we are out on the PTU we can have 1000 people concurrently and that can really be pushing what we see, push the engine, have cases created that we wouldn't seen in an internal test case, and allow us to see some of the problems. And we're continuing to add, to improve on stuff, so we're going crash reporting automated stuff built in in some future version of the clients we'll give people so we can see, the call stacks and what was going on on the client side as well what we see on the server side which we already do.I think the 2.0 PTU testing experience was really great. The one that we spend a fair amount of time on the PTU comparatively to what we've done before. It's also the build we're delivering that probably stresses the engine and the game the most we've ever done. Just the sheer scope and scale of it. A lot of features like the Zone System; the Local Physics, Local Grid: they're all very new systems and of course we've flown around on them but we haven't got all the edge cases you get when you've got tens of thousands of people playing it and seeing if it can break or not.So it was pretty impressive to go from where we started to where we are releasing it live and that's really due to the PTU iterative process: getting a new build out; seeing if things worked; or even sometimes we put things in there that may have made the experience a little worse, because we actually had some extra bug-tracking, memory walking to see if there was memory corruption, and stuff like that.So I thought the PTU experience was great so we kind of want to focus on more of that where before we do a patch we are on the PTU for at least a week or so, so we give it time, we get enough people hammering on it, we can fix some issue and then we go live. So that's going to be our newer model going forward starting next year.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 72", "source": "https://youtu.be/oiXlK8UtLhg", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Banjo", "published_at_timestamp": 1450133932}, {"objectID": "1c6fb6bd6c68ad_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Yes, we will make upgrades to the Archimedes available when it is flyable.", "published_at_timestamp": 1438120800, "question": "Will there be a CCU/Upgrade to the Archimedes when it becomes flyable, for both Merlin and Constellation owners?", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/14865-Q-A-P-52-Merlin", "title": "Q&A: P-52 Merlin", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "373681850", "question": "Has CIG ever considered adding a 'hunting' profession to Star Citizen, which would allow players to travel to wilderness landing zones and hunt dangerous alien beasts?", "answer": "Well, that is very cool, it sounds very much like Evolve (which was also built in CryEngine by the way), so we've... longer term, we are planning on doing some exploration style stuff, where we generate sort of patches of procedural planet that you can go and explore, so that's some of the R&D that we're doing, we're actually doing some of that longer-term in Frankfurt, so that's the stuff they'll be working on after we've got the large world server stuff/multicrew stuff going. And that would be one of the things you'd do, cause we'd create these areas where you can go explore, where you can find some minerals, maybe some alien artifacts, maybe there would be some alien beasts that would attack you and you could defend yourself, or you could go find them as specimens, or you could go hunt them as is suggested here. That is something that, on the longer term, will be some of a fun gameplay.Our goal is to build the world out, and add these features as games are existing, there should be, as I've said many times, I want to have a very rich, varied amount of gameplay. It's not just about dogfighting in space or not just about hauling cargo, which is what you'd normally see in space games, so we're really trying to embrace a whole bunch of different play areas and styles so, long term, this is definitely something that'd be a fun one, and probably not too difficult to do, because if you play FarCry 4, that's a element in there, and if you've played FarCry 3, FarCry4, they're all essentially on the Junior engine, which came in from CryEngine, so a lot of the stuff that we have would, as long as we got the time to build it, that'd be doable.

We've already started kind of laying the groundwork in a lot of our dispatches and now on Around the 'Verse we have Empire Report and those are kind of dipping our toes into this idea of these ongoing fictional pieces. So, hopefully when the Persistent Universe goes live, you'll be having semi-regular Empire Reports that are commenting on what's happening in the game at that moment or Kaizens giving the latest financial update on how so-and-so company is doing really well and it's going to be a monumental task and we're going to have to really figure out, you know, how much we're going to be able to iterate and how quickly and really streamline that process... so, you know in an ideal world we can record stuff and get it in very fast. At least that's the end goal. I'm very hopeful.Adam Wieser: Yeah. I know, again from just my brief time here, that there is a very conscious effort - especially from Dave - in making sure that the personalities behind these shows, the personalities that are leading the discussions, are more than just vehicles to get information across. He wants them to be real living, breathing people with viewpoints - with certain angles on things - and even with some long term perspectives. So, it's good to know that he's thinking about that already... that we're trying to think of these people as people that will be affecting the 'verse in many different ways going forward.When that came up... it's good to see that and to know that that's definitely something we'll be working on and digging in to.WW: Yeah, totally, it's just from the heart of Chris' vision of the players in Star Citizen having that impact on the universe and part of that will be seeing - hopefully - their actions influence these programs that they can watch and listen to... and then hopefully not everything will be a new show too.

It's something that you sort of learn to not take personally.  Because at the end of the day, what we're all trying to do is make the best game possible.  And us, specifically, we're trying to accomplish that by making the best art possible.  And we may think that something works very very well, and it just doesn't, and if we keep holding that close to the chest and we take the criticisms personally, it's just going to make it harder for us to see how we can make the art better.  So the way I deal with it is I just realize it's not a personal thing.  Although I put myself into the artwork I create, the artwork isn't actually me, it's the thing I made, so you're just trying to help me make that better, and so is everyone else, so why would I take that personally.  It's not always easy to do that, and everyone deals with it differently, but that's my perspective.  We're all on the same team.LP: Yeah, I think to add to that, this is one of those projects that's not like a traditional console project.  It's not a 3-4 year property, where you're in a bubble hidden from the world for a long time and then all of a sudden the marketing machine gets turned on 6 months before hand and you're like here's our stuff.  And the world goes, okay, that looks pretty cool.  6 months later it's in their hands and they're playing it and you start watching the metacritic go down.  We're not that case.  We're a really public company, it's a huge project, we've got a lot of really top men and women working on the job, and it's one of those cases where we're slowly rolling things out ot the public, in an alpha state where they have the opportunity to see things sometimes as short as days from the thought of the original thing.  So it's a very rare case where, if somebody doesn't like something, well, we got it out there to test it.  It's alpha, right?  At some point in time it's going to be refined and redefined and rolled back out and polished.  This is one of those properties where you really put your passion into it, and you meet the vision of the vision we're matching, and then we go forward.  As long as your passion is satisfied, that's where we usually I think we tend to kind of stop  how hard we get impacted by criticism.  I did my best, we did a great job, I like the way it looks, you can't please everybody.  But goddamn it looks great.  And, again, like the lightsaber with the little hand-guard on the end...EB: I had absolutely no problem with that.LP: Right, me neither, a lot of people hated it.  In the end, they're going to see it, and they're going to be like, oh, that's cool.EB: They're going to forget about it two seconds later, cause there's so much more to take in.

But we definitely have canisters you can blow up, there's all sorts of environmental destruction and effects that can happen in the FPS levels. We'll use a lot of that, taking advantage of the physics in CryEngine.

Even back in the Wing Commander days you'd be able to have wingmen \"Attack My Target\" or \"Form Up On My Wing\" etc, so you'll definitely be able to issue commands to your wingmen. You'll also be able to issue higher level goals like, \"Ok I'm hiring you, your mission is to protect my freelancer ship\" so you can have a couple of mercenaries to fly on your wing to make sure you get from point A to point B and you could hire NPCs to say take a cargo from one place to another place and other various stuff like that.

I'm not so sure about simulating it all the way, but we're playing around with the ideas of certain areas in space that have an environment that affects your communications, how you fly... and obviously being close to a black hole would be one of those environments... or into a deep gas cloud inside the rings of a planet... all those kinds of things. So we are looking to see what kind of interesting astrological aspects or physical effects that would come from various different elements in space, could affect the game play, could affect your ship, all the rest of the stuff.

In the case of a bounty, generally bounty hunters are after you when there's a bounty that's put on your head, and mostly that's for lawful reasons.So I would assume that if you've broken the law and there's a bounty on your head, you can see you're listed on the most wanted list, then you would know the UEE or the authorities did this to me.If it was a private transaction, I'm not so sure.

Like the main planet in the system or whatever.But there's a lot of the system that will not be mapped in your basic navigation map, and if you fly around, this is one of the things that explorers can do. If you fly around in different areas, you may find an asteroid field which isn't on the navigation map or something else, then you essentially map that on your map and you have it as your localized navigation point/coordinate/area of interest and you can write your own notes about it, then share it with members of your organization. So if you discovered an asteroid field that has some rich minerals to mine, and no one else has seen it, you can broadcast that to everyone else in your organization and say \"hey let's go here and do this mining,\" and everyone else won't know about it.Now of course you would be able to sell some of that to a general cartographer company. Think of the navigation computers as a modern day GPS, you get an updated the disk of locations to drive in. So another option is explorers could go around mapping stuff out, then when they've mapped out the system fully, they can go and sell that and that could become available for purchase for a large group of people in the same way that we talked about for jump points.That's all things you can do, so you should be able to share map information between the members of your organization.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 13 (2014.03.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/IIkeFs5xubw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Gharskull", "published_at_timestamp": 1395698672}, {"objectID": "91c6f0b5d6ae4_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Are planets/moons gonna play any factor in the game?
