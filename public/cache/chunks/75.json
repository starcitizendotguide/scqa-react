It has a fleshy, violet, trumpet-shaped, fuzz-covered stem that amplifies a natural sound created by the expansion and contraction of the hyphae as water passes through it. Because the mushroom is easily grown on spacecraft, it became popular as an on-board plant shortly after its commercial debut in 2925.</p><br/><h1>DEVELOPMENT</h1><br/><p>In 2918, genetics graduate students Mauveine Senae and Phil Ektos started a project to create an edible version of the fast-growing purple chimney mushroom, a toxic fungus indigenous to Reisse (Rhetor III). Dr. Yuki Hexa, Senae\u2019s advisor, joined the project after Senae and Ektos presented their early results: a mushroom with a deeper funnel shape and slightly less toxicity. As the team made further modifications to the mushroom\u2019s genetic code, the toxicity failed to fall to levels safe for Human consumption, but the divot in its stem deepened. One night, Ektos heard a strange tone in the lab, and traced it to the latest generation of mushrooms.</p><br/><p>The team agreed to reframe their project to bring out the new audio qualities of the mushroom. By the end of 2920, they had developed a stable breeding population of mushrooms that produced varying tones depending on their size. Senae created a personal garden of the mushrooms in her dorm room, arranged so they resembled performers on a tiny stage. Hexa suggested the name \"opera mushroom\" after seeing this display. In early 2921, Ektos and Senae submitted their work on the opera mushroom to their dissertation committees and were awarded doctorates.</p><br/><h1>LIFECYCLE</h1><br/><p>After a four-week growing period, the constant motion of water through the mature mushroom causes ballistospores to slowly eject from the trumpet. After these spores fall onto a suitable substrate, they take root into a mycelium from which the mushrooms emerge. More and more mushrooms grow as the mycelium spreads underground, sometimes resulting in a widening ring-like pattern. Places where opera mushrooms grow can often be heard before they are seen.</p><br/><h1>COMMERCIAL DEBUT</h1><br/><p>Samples of the opera mushroom were made available to plant nurseries on Reisse in 2925. Thanks to its novelty and fast growth cycles, the fungus was an instant hit. It became a popular houseplant, especially for long-haul spacefarers in need of something low-maintenance to decorate their holds. Skilled gardeners can grow mushrooms in arrangements that produce harmonizing tones. </p><br/><p>In 2926, a wild, self-sustaining population of opera mushrooms was discovered 11 kilometers from the UR Genetics lab. The mushrooms continue to grow in the wild on Reisse today.

Are you in a state now that you'd term beta? What's next?", "answer": "Chris Roberts: The term beta in terms of Star Citizen - with 3.0 the game is moving into a phase akin to Early Access. It'll build and grow from there, and then you could say 'well, it's not really Early Access anymore'. The price will probably go up a little bit and it will have much more of the features and content going on.<br /><br />3.0 is the first time you'll have some of the basic game loops and mechanics. It's the first one which has proper persistence for your character, ship and items in terms of what their state is, their location is. When you log off and your ship is damaged, when you come back it'll still be damaged. There are a lot of jobs and options. The AI is still fairly basic - there's a lot more coming, but the AI... the previous 2.63 update was done the old scripted way. Now it's a scalable, modular mission system which designers can build from different blocks. We have procedural missions so there's a lot of 'go deliver something to this place', 'go identify a dead body on a spaceship', 'go after this particular pirate'. It's all templated up. There's a basic buying and selling mechanic, hauling cargo, the ability to earn and spend money on clothes, weapons, ship items or ship weapons. 3.1 will let you buy ships as well. And then from there we'll add more features for specific activities - mining, repair, building out more of the infrastructure for a dynamic universe.", "published_at": "2017-09-11", "title": "Star Citizen 3.0 update \"akin to Early Access\" launch", "source": "http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-08-29-star-citizen-would-be-the-worst-scam-in-the-world", "type": "article", "user": "Tom Phillips", "published_at_timestamp": 1505088000}, {"objectID": "1029923612", "question": "In what way will Star Citizen leverage the Amazon Web Services integration with Lumberyard?", "answer": "We have built our game since day one to take advantage of cloud computing and have always run our platform and game environments on cloud platforms.

It\u2019s more about what is right for that situation? What gameplay aspect is right for that situation?

Like hatch, thrusters, seats, doors, panels, etc? On the game side, visually speaking, how customizable are the ships in general? (like in a Need for Speed underground manner). I know about the possibility to change the seats but could we expect some more customizations like an interior paint job, switching to fancier escape pods/beds, changing the whole dashboard, more powerful headlights, better kitchen, etc.", "answer": "Elwin Bachiller: I think it's a tentative yes to that second part. Just to hit on the whole manufacturer sharing assets. That absolutely a yes. It's almost, it's absolutely necessary that we do something like that in order to develop the number of ships that we have to make. So what that means is that we will have escape pods that are common to Aegis for example and you should expect to see those escape pods in other Aegis ships. Docking collars, same thing. You may even see chairs that are shared among the same manufacturer.Right now, you will notice that on the Freelancer, you've got a specific type of chair which also exists on the starfarer, which a very close version of that also exists on the Reliant. And there's a couple of reasons for doing that. One, it keeps the look and feel the same so you can identify what manufacturer built your ship. Two, we can actually build a ship much faster. Right, sharing of assets within manufacturers is absolutely something we have to do. In terms of customization, we are still working on what the full range of customization is. The most obvious and sort of start of the customization process that we really want to hit is allowing people to change the paint jobs on their ships. We're exploring a couple different ways of doing this. We haven't quite implemented a full working version of it yet, but it's something we are building our current ships to support.Patrick Salerno: Yup, no, definitely, just on Elwin's note, I mean part of the development process is making something, trying out different techniques for it, and find out whether it works. So we do a lot of R&D into different ways to do it. Some methods make the cut, some don't. We used to have a paint system that was... it was a little harder to work with. We had paints, we had it working, and it's just, it's a juggle. You say \"does this help the pipeline?\", \"is there another way we can do this faster?\".That constant iteration is kind of why we like working here as well. You can make changes to things, and find a better way to do it. You're not just stuck somewhere, you know? You might have to go back and change old stuff occasionally, but in the grand scheme of things, it's gonna help the entire pipeline. So, we're making everything basically as modular as possible within sensical terms. So, should be able to go out and get other parts. So definitely, modularity is something we already have and can expand upon. We just have to make sure it's a good use of time management and et cetera, et cetera.EB: Right, right, and just to touch on what you mentioned of us previously having a paint system. That system was harder to work with. But it also became... it created a conflict with the way we wanted to do damage, just because of the specific implementation method and as a result of that, we went in favor of the damage to find a different way of doing the customization of the paints.PS: 'Cause the damage is so much cooler.EB: Well, yes it is.PS: Bomb metal melting away and everything! So instead of saving... basically, the way it works is you have UV maps, if anyone knows what those are, it's where the textures get painted onto and the way the tech works is the damage shader kind of, it works over the UV maps, but you also needed the UV, the paints in the UV too. So they were kind of sharing the same space, right? So we were like well, what do we pick? Then we're like \"Well, the paints can probably be done a more another way, and more efficiently, and this is just the best way for the damage system to work\". That's how, kind of how where opportunity calls for it.EB: That also, I mean, that also kind of touches back in the \"what features have we decided not to implement\". That is one of them. Yeah, so we're working on a much better way of allowing customization which... the goal is to let people not only change, you know, at least several different colors on their ship, but also attempt to allow them to pick, decals for their wings, or whatever, that way they have like a massive happy face or whatever they want to put on it. So we have some prototypes of that working and I think it's going to be really cool, but more work has to go into it.", "published_at": "2016-03-21", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 07", "source": "https://youtu.be/9otSsylG3OI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Johan_26", "published_at_timestamp": 1458597254}, {"objectID": "373675660", "question": "We know there will be an Alpha 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 but how many more +.1 iterations are currently planned before you reach another major milestone, presumably an Alpha 3.0?", "answer": "That is a good question, right now we don't really have an answer so right now we really don't have an Alpha 3.0 planned out on our roadmap.

He asked basically what is the pipeline step and one thing I was going to speak to after that is how long a character takes and you know 8 weeks ago or not 8 weeks ago, 4 months ago in our tech, we couldn't have answered that question, but now we can and it's going to keep going faster. What are the steps for a character?FS: So the the way that we do characters and I've kind of mentioned this a couple times, but now it's really set in stone, were actually implementing that which is great. We build characters very different than most games. We don't build full characters, we build clothing accessories and then we have our scanned heads and then our base bodies. When we build a character, we don't need a character artist to go in and build a character from scratch.We can have designers go in a plug in different types of clothing and then that creates your NPC. So the NPC's use the same system that the players use to customize themselves right? We build wardrobes and we have these manufacturers for all this stuff. We also have this dynamic wear system for clothing to make it feel newer or older so when it comes to creating characters crime people right? You want to create some hooligans or something, it really depends. You take the clothing that you want to stereotype I guess as what would be crime, but really what it's about is.EKD: Crime in that universe, what was dictated by our Writers and Designers.FS: Yeah, but you're really gonna have, it's more going to be in the areas where we place these characters and maybe we have certain character and we place them in darker alleyways and maybe we wear there clothes a little more so they're not so pristine. That is what gives you the illusion that these characters could be potentially be committing crimes. It gives our designers the ability to create these characters without needing our character artists to actually do it.EKD: It's a very unique ideas of saying if I put these five pieces on a character, it means they're from this class system, they're from this planet, they're this place in their life. There's all these cool things that go into it instead of saying I'm going to make the crime person, here that's the only one you can use. It's like If I go up or down, maybe the crimes a little less and more which I even talked about on the StarMap so it kinda all blending into the same idea.FS: And you can have crime that you know, people that look nicer and you can have people that are quite wealthyEKD: Blue collar crime, white collar crime.FS: And you can have people that are quite wealthy in the game that decide to look like your average joe and you don't really know which is kind of cool because it's kinda like real life right? And then what is all involved in getting the NPC's back to us. So creating all the clothing, creating the system in the game that allows you to pick the different clothes and then that allows us to have the designer be able to pick the different clothes for the NPC's that are in the game.So it's one system, we do it once and then everybody has what they need and then how long do you need for one character? Again it's really based off the article of clothing, it's not about one character. Each clothing accessory we learned takes about a week and a half, something like that. So for a shirt or for a pair of pants maybe a week and then multiple that by how many combination you want or however many we want to do.EKD: And each those pieces have a certain amount set amount of deliveries and those deliveries have different review specifications and depends on if we're doing it in house or if we're working with an outsourcer, there's a lot of different factors that go into play with that. As quick as we can, that's the goal, we're trying to make things quickly so he can get more variations and have more options.FS:  And then you know is it like the ship pipeline concept, backstory, greybox, whitebox. Yeah it's very much like that. All of our pipelines really run a similiar, they really run in parallel with each other. You have the concept for the clothes. First actually you'll read it in order, first you have your backstory so the lore and the writers kind of decide what all the types of clothing you'll have in the game and then we have concept artists draw the actual clothing to fit the lore. Then we have the whitebox stage which we kind of block it out and get it in there. Then we have our greybox stage which is actually we make it look nicer, we start making sure the tech works with everything and then we do our polish stage which is our final pass.EKD: This is a good question I felt for Forest because he, when I started we were developing.FS: We just got done with that.EKD: We just done developing it, it's a very interesting, the fidelity to get certain levels of characters you really gotta hit all these pieces because they all they have different reasons. I want to get his version of this character because I want to get the designers to start using it and actually feeling the flow of the game.

So think of it like playstation sharing where the ultimate idea is I'm flying around and I'll stream this and if I was on the website and I was looking at the user icon or ID for me, you could have like a little red dot next to him and go \"Oh look, he's streaming\" and you can click on him and *Pssh* open up and see what he's streaming which would be pretty cool.Also I wanted to have cameras set around the universe so you can sort of almost see traffic cams on what's happening. So we'll put some sort of spectator cams that we'll stream in the universe that you will be on the web and you can go to our site and go \"Oh look, what's happening in Tera right now? What's happening around Crusader?.\" Those are sort of pretty cool streaming options. We have the Reliant News Van which we just announced during the livestream and one of the sort of kind of more fun smaller professions is the streamer, the new reporter or whatever, where you could stream action that's happening and go around and that's kind of what the Reliant News Van is for. The idea would be to sort of film action and you can stream it and obviously you can see it on the website, but maybe some of it could be streamed ingame so to speak.So if you were in a bar on the T.V. maybe that kind of thing is streaming is. Additionally we want to do the same for races. We really do want to make the Murray Cup something that is fiction and happens and has a whole series of races that gets competed over a season and there's qualifying rounds and all the rest of the stuff and yeah we have a competition for it in Star Citizen that's in fiction that you can watch in a bar or you can also watch on the sight for the races. People can compete and train for it and ultimately we want to do the same with Arena Commander in Star Citizen because \"The Men of the in fiction game\". We're sort of going to do in Esports, Game within a game kind of thing.Hope that answered the question, I'm not quite sure if you wanted to see the view of another player in your view in the actual game itself, so potentially we may allow that because that's not that difficult, you just switch their viewpoint, but that would depend on the equipment. We already have a mini version of that because if you're in the sort of rear operator seat of the Super Hornet and you operate the turret, you are now seeing the turrets point of view, not actually your point of view sitting in the cockpit. There's already sort of this looking at some other viewpoint in the game via that.

Will it be possible to jury rig repairs using components from other systems to get your ship limping home under it's own power? Will there be a skill system in place that would reflect the ability of the character to repair the various ship systems?", "answer": "We're definitely going to have, I think we may have even mentioned it and discussed it a little bit in the repair design document, it was part of when we launched the Crucible as a concept sale. There's going to be repair of components that you can do, changing out the equivalent of all the valves, circuit boards or capacitors or whatever you want to think on certain things that could be damaged or blown to get your ship back. We're also going to ultimately allow you the ability to do some kind of minimal repair. Like maybe EVA out and seal up an area, that you have to seal up before you can carry on going.So we're definitely going to give you some sort of small personal EVA/FPS style repair that you can go about your ship, like when you're taking damage on your Constellation maybe someone has to run back to the engine room to do something in the engine room because otherwise their reactors are going to overload, so you've got to bring it down to take the safeties off and bring the power down to fifty percent or whatever or change out a conduit or whatever it would be. So we're going to add that as gameplay cause we think it would be cool especially on the multi crew ships to allow some of that but obviously the proper fixing your ship up so that you can take it to a real mechanic, that kind of thing, that would require someone to show up with a Crucible or you take it to one of the NPC repair stations. Of which we have a very simple prototype in the mini PU the SC Alpha 2.0 but that's just a basic placeholder compared to what ultimately we plan to go with. Where you would take it to a repair ship and they would say ok it's going to take you this long and cost you this much to get it fixed.As far as skill based settings for repairing the stuff we're really trying to make it so the player, or your character is based on your skill of playing the game and the equipment you've acquired and how you use it as a player. Now NPC's will probably have their own RPG stats cause we'll just need to determine if they're good or experienced or are they bad and so probably some NPC repair people can be better ones or worse ones based on their skill stats, but for you as a player it will be about just about how you do it. It will be about your resourcefulness whether you kept the extra components you need, so we kind of would think on a big ship you may actually come fly with some extra items and spare parts to fix things up when things get damaged.", "published_at": "2015-12-07", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 71", "source": "https://youtu.be/QNGq1BkPINU", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Alex", "published_at_timestamp": 1449529998}, {"objectID": "1587e0d6078e4b_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The variants mentioned in the post exist in our fiction, and we hope to build out all of them down the line.

I'm not quite sure because there are extra issues having all of the ships etc in the hangar as well, we've got more optimisation to do there too, we don't want to kill frame rates etc so I'd say the amount of people you can get in your hangar will be as many as 8-32, we don't quite know yet. We're looking at releasing the FPS module first as you know, and we don't want to release the social module right after that for a number of reasons, first of all code stability and changing streams etc, you just need some time. Plus, everyone's going to be playing FPS! We decided not to have 2 modules come out within 2 or ever 4 weeks of each other. That's the plan anyway, it's not like we're doing less work for them, we're just releasing more when we do the drop. Part of that is figuring out some of the optimisation stuff, that's always ongoing, but basically you'll see you'll be able to invite a certain number of people to your hangar, which WILL be your hangar, not instanced, so everyone in your hangar will be in the same instance. We're playing around with some ideas in the cloud infrastructure that might allow us to optimise and include many more players in a single instance, but that's longer term stuff. Ultimately the goal is to be able to support lots of players running around in an environment, as well as say, in a space battle, having plenty of ships involved plus lots of people inside the ships. That kind of setup would involve multiple servers managing different players, so because some players would be inside ships we can apportionate that to different servers, so we can effectively have a seemingly higher player count in the 1 area. So in the actual space area you might be limited in the number of ships, and within the ships a number of players. That's the long term goal anyway, there are a lot of steps along the way we need to deal with.", "published_at": "2015-03-30", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 58 (2015.03.30)", "source": "https://youtu.be/joKjDdKcOMQ", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Sailor67", "published_at_timestamp": 1427752772}, {"objectID": "373676470", "question": "The Mustang recently saw performance changes in AC 1.0.2. How are these changes achieved in an engine that physically models ship movement? Do these changes affect maneuverability across other ships?", "answer": "So specifically in the Mustang, while I'm not 100% about what we did in 1.0.2 &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; though I know for 1.1 we've been doing a re-factor on IFCS and flight control modeling and background mathematical models we're using &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; to give a more predictable consistent outcome to the actual physical simulations. So hopefully in 1.1, there will be more stability of some of the flight issues Backers have seen. So it's aiming for 1.1, possibly for 1.1.1. It's still a work in progress.But generally, before that, if we're doing changes we're mostly doing things like adjusting thrust on various thrusters, adjusting mass to balance it, etc. We don't have any hard-line rules, like, \"Okay, this ships rolls at this rate,\" &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; because everything is physically simulated. So we have to do things like move the position of a thruster, change the thruster mass, the amount of thrust put out, the mass of the ship, etc.We've had some Mustang issues, like a bucking issue (which is kinda appropriate for a Mustang since it, you know, bucks...). So you'll see these issues addressed in 1.1, or even 1.1.1. As well as the ability to toggle ESP off and on like you do with COMSTAB and G-SAFE. Generally, localized changes on ships don't affect other ships, because we're just changing the stats on the ship.But the work John's doing is gonna make the system a lot more stable inherently &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; and that will affect all the ships so they fly and feel a little better. Because as things are changed along the way, sometimes flight can deteriorate a bit because everything is physically modeled, so we have to go back and re-balance things to fix it up &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; just like in the real world!", "published_at": "2015-03-02", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 55 (2015.03.02)", "source": "https://youtu.be/s_XND_PjFrE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "SP3CTREnyc", "published_at_timestamp": 1425338006}, {"objectID": "373677280", "question": "I have read a lot of awesome material on history, events, planets, and people, but what about the Arts?

But as far as like the historical stuff too, I mean specifically the Shakespearean sonnets I imagine, even now as technology has allowed us to save and preserve stuff, it probably won't have the prevalence, social prevalence, that it would have today.

You may not be able to take off until you've got all that stuff fixed.But we probably wouldn't make it so someone would show up in orbit, and then just be stuck there and have to eject or something.Who knows, in later stages, not v1, but as we get further into development where we actually have some free flight down on the planets, whether that would be effective and the damage would affect it.

We have it in our internal test stuff where in later game modes you can land and then you can rearm and refuel your ship and get back out there in the combat, because obviously some level of the ammunition you use, ballistic weaponry, missiles, are consumable, finite, right. And then there's fuel which would be consumed mostly by your after burners.So we're gonna actually put some of that in the dogfighting module. Not right away, but down the road as one of the things to do.That's really just laying the ground work for some of the bigger battles because when players will have a bigger ship like a frigate or destroyer or whatever the bigger ships will be, you'll be able to land and do the same thing, and then also we're gonna have some level of ships that potentially could do in-flight refueling or or would have some level of repair ability, or that kind of stuff. Those are all things we're thinking about to try and make some bigger battles where you have mixed use of arms. You've got a couple of big capital ships and some fighters and people have to do all sorts of different things in it.It should be pretty cool, that's one of the things that the UK team will be spearheading, the bigger ship stuff because it's a primary driver of Squadron 42, so they're working on that as we speak as well as helping out on the Dogfight.", "published_at": "2014-05-26", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 22.

I would think what we would do in that sort of case is essentially the planet would recognize that you're really shot up and just say you're clear to land without you having to request.I think in terms of landing on another ship in space like a carrier or a Corvette, in that case you would probably have to do a manual landing, not an automatic landing, and then of course if none of that works, you can always use your escape pod. But there certainly will be some handling of the landing.
