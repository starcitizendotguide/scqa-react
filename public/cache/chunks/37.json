Maybe we have in 2.3, anyway! All of our releases are blowing in, we definitely have it in 2.3.In reality it really is you have, sort of, personal reputations in your organisations that your members will have reputations with other organizations and individuals and so every time you come into contact with an organisation or another individual, you sort of start at a neutral status unless the group, like for instance, if you're a member of the UEE and you meet a Vanduul, well we already know that Vanduul and the UEE are locking heads therefore the Vanduul will probably be going after you. Most of the time, let's say player or player groups, the reputation or kind of whatever you want to call alignment what you are versus the other player gets tracked.So, as you do something negative to them it will go into negative as you do something positive will go into positive and we keep a track of everyone you come into contact with and track those relationships as well as tracking the organisation or the group relationships on a global level and, of course, we have whatever you want to call them, NPC or game organizations like the UEE or the Vanduul or the Merchants Guild, Mercenaries Guild, all those things are defined by us, but the reputation system will be a combination of your personal reputation with various groups that you come into contact will be influenced by groups you're a member of that you publicly admit to be a member of and we track it as you do things and go from there.It will be fairly nuanced and it will allow players to kind of make their way in the galaxy and decide who they're aligned with, who they aren't aligned with and I think it will be a lot more nuanced than good guy or bad guy, because in the world of Star Citizen there really isn't going to be a good guy and bad guy. In just the UEE Empire, there's a lot of different factions and interests that want different kinds of things and you could be aligned with one of them, but not the other one and that doesn't mean you're a bad guy, it just means you're on one side rather than the other one.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 83", "source": "https://youtu.be/vJoHlCc4Y7E", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Belzoth", "published_at_timestamp": 1461010317}, {"objectID": "373674870", "question": "It was mentioned on INN by Lando recently that the Caterpillar will be somewhat of a benchmark for Drake ships as far as design and looks go. From your perspective, could you expand on that more and how it will affect the Buccaneer, Dragonfly, Herald and Cutlass? How could you see the designs changing based on what you've done with the Caterpillar? I know it is hard to live up to everyone's expectations, but without teasing too much, how excited should we be about what is coming to the rest of the Drake line?", "answer": "Elwin Bachiller: You should be very excited for what's coming for the rest of the Drake line! And it is incredibly hard to live up to any expectations for the quality bar for these ships! But it is true that the Caterpillar is going to be sort of the first, I guess the flagship, ship for Drake. I know we have the Cutlass already out there, and that was one was developed with techniques that we've improved on since they were created.So we will have to go back and sort of upgrade those to the quality of the new ships. So we're trying to hit the bar of essentially what the Retaliator is. So the Retaliator has the latest and greatest technology built into it and I think the Gladius does as well and the Gladiator might have most of that in there.So we have a lot of ships that are already starting to set an example for the kind of quality bar that we want to go for, and also the techniques that we're using for various reasons. Damage, variety. Making sure that we keep our texture resolution high enough requires us to build our ships in a certain specific way. So ships like the Cutlass were not developed that way.Patrick Salerno: Correct.EB: And so it will have to get an upgrade. Now the Caterpillar is sort of the shp that we are pushing for to define the look of what Drake is. So when we're done with that one we will end up having to reuse some of the textures that we developed for it, some of the shape language, maybe even some assets.Whatever makes it easier for us to develop the future ships. Then apply that to the Cutlass, do the same thing with the Herald, do the same thing with the Dragonfly, and the Buccaneer. Ok I wasn't sure those names were public! So you should expect that the lineup for Drake will look a family of ships.So if I look at a Dragonfly I should immediately say \"Hey that's a Drake ship!\" For this and that and that reason. So we're definitely trying to unify the looks with something we've been working on. All of the manufacturers you should be able to see this now between the Starfarer and the Freelancer. The UK team did a really great job unifying those two ships. They look like they're exactly from the same family. The Reliant also because it used a lot of assets that were involved in the UK. So we're trying to do the same thing with Drake and the Caterpillar is the first one online.PS: Yeah. And then as Elwin was saying as we build more ships based on our Style Guides you'll see a more cohesive look come together. 'Cause the more pieces you have from things you remade you end up getting a giant library based on these pieces and design aesthetics. So it's easier for existing artists, new artists to just come in pick up, go \"Oh that's what that manufacturer looks like\". Based on existing ships versus the hardest part is coming up with it. You've got all these different manufacturers and each one needs to have a unique aesthetic.EB: Yeah, yeah, cool.", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 07", "source": "https://youtu.be/9otSsylG3OI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Wolf_Frakken", "published_at_timestamp": 1458597254}, {"objectID": "373675680", "question": "I was wondering if we will be able to move elements of the HUD to different monitors? Things like radar, wire frame, pinned targets, chat/comms, etc?", "answer": "We originally had a plan to be able to move things off your HUD and put them on monitors and back and forth, but looking at it and how often it get used we sort of decided that over complicates a system and is not particularly tenable when we have so many different cockpits and everything else.So the plan is that on your HUD you should be able to customize it by moving your widgets around or add new widgets if you get new functionality with avionics. Then on your monitors, in your cockpit, the functionality of those comes from the different devices or items or avionics that are plugged into your system. Then there is a certain amount of, \"I'll default this one to the damage screen or this one to the shield screen.\" You won't be able to take things from your visor and put them onto your monitors in your cockpit or vice versa but you will be able to customise your HUD in terms of layout and things you can see. Then you will also be able to default to what you should be able to see on the monitors.Of course that would also depend on what kind of ship like the starter ships, which we don't have implemented now, would have much more basic functionality for IFCS to avionics. You wouldn't have nearly as many knobs and dials as you do currently and then as you upgrade your ship or avionics, a bigger more powerful one, then they come with the advanced operation with the many tabs that you can open up and now there's more options for you.So the idea as a beginner is you start with a starter ship, just like a starter car you would have, and it's simpler to operate and use but as you play the game more you want to have control over specific stuff you would upgrade your system or move to a different kind of ship. I think that will be much better for the beginning user experience because right now the beginning user experience is pretty overwhelming. Unless you're up on everything you get thrown into Crusader it can be pretty daunting. First of all, the control schemes are not consistent between modes (FPS to flying) and also the overwhelming things you can do in terms of shields, weapons, and all the rest is fairly overwhelming for a basic user experience.We're going to be working on that as well as we go forward because we're getting bigger and the community is getting bigger, I really would like for the experience for the new people to be better. Also we're doing things to make the tutorial to make it easier and better, maybe a different approach to the tutorial, so that's all on the list of things that we have to work our way through.

This ship has quite a past, right, we've learned a lot from that Freelancer from when it was here and then the UK was working on it. I wanted this one kind of for Forest because he has a lot of history with the Freelancer to talk about. So, how does that change now with what we've learned from the Constellation on something like the Freelancer.Forrest Stephan: Right.EKD:  It's one thing to say a variant of the same ship, it's another thing to say a completely different ship that's big. What are the things you know.FS: The Freelancer was interesting because it had a new set of design requirements which was specifically in cargo and so as we're building these ships, they started getting fleshed out and all of the sudden the cargo system comes online. It's like, 'wait, a minute how does this ship actually work with the cargo' and so there was a major overhaul that needed to be done with the Freelancer and not just from the visual side but from actually getting the gameplay mechanics and requirements down. So the UK took it over and I don't know if we showed it yet but they did an awesome job.EKD: I believe we showed it on the livestream. It looks really cool.FS: It looks absolutely fantastic. So, now does it not only look a lot better but they made it actually work with our specifications on the design side....EKD: Yup.FS: Which is great...EKD: As design improves their processes, art improves their processes..FS: Right.EKD: Again they're hand in hand....they're all hand in hand but design has a pretty big laundry list of things they're working on so we're constantly on the production side slating it in, figuring out which one goes where. It's a never ending task of putting all those things together so as Forest mentioned that thought was really interesting he say that, as cargo came online, right? Cause it wasn't really established when they started making it but once it came online we had to go back and we had to change some things out. So, you would think, 'wait, let's do it in order, that's obviously not in order'. That's very true but there are certain situations where we just gotta start making these things....FS: Right.EKD: It's cheaper to make the changes later than it is to wait to get things online sometimes.FS: Because we always gotta keep moving forward.EKD: You got it. We definitely always try to do things in line, Forest and I were just talking about this a few days ago, it's very very important to do things in the right order and sometimes we forget and do it wrong, but we're learning and I think things like the freelancer are starting to benefit from things we learnedFS: Absolutely and it's great too because we start having more style guides come online and art direction starts factoring the way these ships work. When you create your ship the first time you're still trying to figure out what exactly is this going to look like and then when we revisit these ships it gives us a great opportunity to be like,\"Okay, well this is the way the interior should fill, these are the way the beams should look, these are the way the screws should look, these are the way the floor panels look and so when you start getting into these ships it starts looking consistent and if it's a MISC, Freelancer or whatever. It is fun to go back and make sure that they're right because from the art side it also benefits because things start looking consistent and that's what you really want all around.EKD: That's right. That's one of the things I'm excited about in this game you mentioned is bolts and panels and you know things that you would never be able to put that level of detail into a game and we're doing it, I'm super excited.

So I'm not sure we definitely need the anchor thing.Potentially if there was issues with that then perhaps we can: it's not technically that difficult to do. But in the first iteration of the mining design that's not something we were considering because we were basically thinking that the ship was going to stay there right next to rock and you'll mostly be on your ship doing the mining then if you EVA'ed out to go after a really small diamond seam or something the ship will be floating there in space which you can see now. If you park your ship next to an asteroid, EVA out and fly around: it's still there. So in terms of anchoring it to it I don't know.

Are thruster placement, the output of the thrusters, what angles of attack the thrusters can actually influence, and other variables like our turning speed for the actual spinning speed of the ship, are variable we all can play with but to the end result of all of this, we can take a cube and make it fly and we can place thrusters on it how we want and fortunately we don't have to get to that step typically.We do have the white box model that we can take as a reference. We physicalize it. We put actual geometry on it that determines its physical bounds and then we position the thrusters based on the concept and see how it actually flies. We can do things like take, actually nudge the actual thrust itselves so they can influence the mass of the ship better but all this stuff is possible without having any finalized geometry, so we can actually figure out what the ship will fly like before having something that's anywhere close to final and so that helps us out alot what the ship's flight characteristics going to be, *Looks over at Randy Vasquez* What's your experience been like with that?Randy Vasquez: So Caterpillar that we're working on, you helped me out with where were looking at the thruster placement with all that and one of the issues we've with was the Asymmetry of it. So the Asymmetry of it, basically ,once we placed the initial thrusters, that thing was flying all over the place and it was so hard to control, and  you were helping me trying to adjust some of the things.KT: Right and something Randy discussed with me earlier was that the mass distribution does play an important part in the flight characteristic of a ship and so asymmetrical ships with mass that isn't quite balanced makes it a challenge to have the ship fly straight in a way that you kind of need the ship to fly so that you can actually make it do what you want it to do in space.RV: The ballasts controls and everything were trying to like start getting onboard and online, that would with the asymmetrical ships would help big time. Even the regular ships, once the ballast gameplay and everything gets in, so like if you're using so much ammo the ammo goes away, the ballast can fill in for that and adjust to where it needs and wherever.KT: Well eventually be able to do things like putting ballasts in places of the ship. here's a secret, the vanduul ships are completely faked as far as their balance because of the wings are so large that they make the flight characteristics difficult to balance and we cheated a little bit on the wings and this is especially true in the case of the scythe because of it's large right wing and rather miniscule left wing, we needed to kind of cheat the system so that the flight model thinks that both of them weigh the same, therefore it would fly in a straight line, otherwise it would be in the crazy thing that you could not control.

Obviously Chris is looped into all of these conversations too and very hands-on with every aspect but Dave is very capable of keeping the lore portion in check, that's for sure.", "title": "10 For the Writers Episode 03", "source": "https://youtu.be/SGHW2e8BCm4", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Daigoji Gai", "published_at_timestamp": 1433196471}, {"objectID": "692490a48660c_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Yes! Zane Bien has begun development of the 'cargo control' screens which will allow merchant captains full control over the contents of their cargo. This will be available on all transport ships, although it should be especially useful for the Hull series.", "published_at_timestamp": 1430172000, "question": "I also would appreciate to know whether you are planning to release an in-game APP for Merchants to nicely organize their loadings and unloadings of cargo containers along the various many Ports which they will hit on their business trip.\" - Captain B'tak", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/14681-Q-A-MISC-Hull-A", "title": "Q&A: MISC Hull A", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "373676120", "question": "Regardless of it being a bad idea, will it be possible to fly a ship without a helmet, goggles, contact lenses, eye implants or direct neural interface? In other words, will it be possible to fly a ship without a HUD, and instead, being forced to rely solely upon the displays in the cockpit?", "answer": "Well, it will definitely be possible to fly without a helmet and goggles, etc, etc. If the ship is set up the correct way, then you'd probably only see the display... I mean, a lot of the Heads Up Displays are actually in the cockpit space and so those probably would pop up. But the way the ship's system works, again I was just talking about items and plugging in... well, you as a player &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; your clothes, your shirt's an item, your space suit is an item, your helmet is an item and all of those plug in and have pipes so you, as a player, can plug in to the ship so when you sit in a seat you actually plug in to the data port and the power port and the heat port and all the rest of the things. Then, through you all of the items you are wearing plug in to the ship... so what happens when you sit in a seat is it sort of plugs in and boots up basically, so if you've got the helmet you will get the display on your helmet but if you don't have the helmet you will usually by default see it on the screens in the cockpit or the Heads Up Display that is projected inside the cockpit. So, it sort of works based on what sort of display items you have.So, there will definitely be a case where you can get into a ship and not necessarily have all of the items. Now, there will be some ships that rely on you to have a full fighter pilot setup &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; like a Gladius or a Hornet or something like that &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; where it may not let you fly unless you've got the full pilot setup on. But Civilian ships aren't like that. In a Constellation or even an Aurora, it will be much more... \"What do you have\" and you're using the in-cockpit diegetic stuff instead of something on a visor.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 57 (2015.03.23)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Aoooemaw2lY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Kommissar", "published_at_timestamp": 1427148202}, {"objectID": "373676490", "question": "Can I fly from a space station in Earth orbit to a space station in Lunar orbit without engaging my quantum drive? Or will traveling between such points require the use of the quantum drive?", "answer": "That is a good question. So the way we're setting up the solar systems is one of the big reasons we went to large world. It's gonna be one continuous space &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; there won't be separate maps for each area. So there won't be, like, an orbit around Earth and an orbit around the Moon. But they will be very far apart from each other because, obviously, scale is pretty big. So while we won't be realistic size for a solar system, it will be relatively compared to what you're used to in a game, but massive.So if you went to fly at our normal speed, it would take days to get to another point of interest. I have no doubt that there will be diehards who do that, like the one person who went across the Minecraft map for forever. But generally, you'll wanna do quantum drive to get there to avoid taking up all that extra time. But yes, the system would be able to handle you just flying and flying and flying if you wanted to.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 55 (2015.03.02)", "source": "https://youtu.be/s_XND_PjFrE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Kommissar", "published_at_timestamp": 1425338006}, {"objectID": "373683410", "question": "Has any consideration been given to supporting other head mounted displays other than Oculus Rift? Have you seen any of the new technologies such as the Sony Morpheus and Avegant Glyph? Is this possible to support the other devices within Star Citizen?", "answer": "Yes, we haven't... err... so, the Morpheus right now, from my understanding is just for the PS4. If they let it be used on a PC then we would definitely look at supporting that, and there's already been some work that has been done actually in CryEngine to support that, by Crytek.I don't know what the Avegant Glyph is, but if it's cool we probably would. I mean, we've looked at some other stuff like space glasses, which is sort of a cool glass you can wear that has an overlay on top, which may be something interesting for an overlaid HUD setup. But yeah, we kind of want to support a bunch of head-mounted displays and things also like TrackIR, so that's all on our list of stuff to do. So it all depends on what the tech is like, and is it cool, and also does it fit in with what we've done? So if we're already doing Oculus Rift support then things like Sony's Morpheus is an easier thing to support than doing it from scratch.So the answer is, yes, there has been some consideration - we're not quite sure exactly the extent of it.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 29.

Its nice to be able to film all these things, and have a whole team work on doing a 60 page monthly magazine, because I think everyone out there geeks out as much as we do here.So we'd love to share it, but unfortunately, doing all that at the level we do it takes time and money, and so that's what the subscription is for.

There will be the simpler player created missions where it's like \"I need to hire someone to escort me\" or \"I need to hire someone to take an item or items from planet A to planet B.\" Those are all pretty simple.In terms of hiring someone to--putting a bounty on someone. I mean you can't... like in general... There's two levels of it like in the real world. If I decide I'm going to pay someone $10,000 to kill someone, well I can do that, but that's not necessarily legal. I would have to go to some underworld hitman and pay him and I can get caught and in trouble for doing that.So in terms of the bounty stuff, I think if you're putting bounties on people like \"I'll pay you so much to take out this pirate,\" then you're probably not going to get in trouble with the UEE, but if you put a bounty \"I'm going to pay you so much to take out my rival trader\" or \"someone I just don't like\" in this regulated space, then not only does the person who's taken the hit run the risk of getting in trouble, but if someone's commissioned the hit, then potentially they could get in trouble with the UEE.It all depends on a per mission basis, but generally I think there would be a certain amount of missions that players can request from NPCs and then there's the other level where you can also request them from other players and then you probably would be able to have a more nuanced mission for other players, because obviously you're not dealing with an AI or an NPC.For the last part of this question \"How will information runners and smugglers know I require their unique skillset?\" Well I think it sort of depends.There'll definitely be cases where getting information or a data packet from one place or another part of the universe is very important and there potentially will be people trying to prevent that data packet from getting there. It really is sort of like a courier mission is really what the information runner missions are like, and a lot of times if we generate them, there potentially will be another corporation trying to block that information, so there'll be some conflict along the way.And then on the smugglers skillset, things like a smuggler or putting out a hit on someone, which really is placing a bounty on someone unless you're placing a bounty on someone who's on the wanted list, that's where you would go to the shady areas on the various planets. A lot of our planets have, like Terra for instance, has a more shady slum area verses a more hoity toity area, and you would sort of go to one of the back alley ways and one of the disreputable bars, and that's where you could find someone you could sell or buy stuff on the black market, or do smuggling missions, or potentially take a hit out for you. It will be kind of based on the environment and context, just like it would be in real life. So we want to give that sense of flavor to all the locations when you're going around.It's not going to be a small amount of work, but I think if you get all that, this will be a much cooler, more engrossing world for everyone.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 22.

I have searched far and wide for information on Star Citizen voice acting. My question therefore is:Will Star Citizen be fully voice acted, partially, or not at all?", "answer": "Ok, so there's two things here, Squadron 42 obviously is going to be full, we're actually in the process of planning it right now.We're gonna do a full motion capture performance capture, so very similar to what's done in Avatar where you have the full actors running around in body suits with cameras on their heads and that will translate into the game.We have, I think, a pretty strong and compelling story for Squadron 42, I'm pretty excited by it. It's gonna be as big and rich as any Wing Commander I've done, possibly quite a bit beyond that. So Squadron 42 itself will be as big as if I were making another Wing Commander now for EA or someone, Squadron 42 would be that to the same level of polish and presentation.We have that, and then on top of that, roaming around Star Citizen, yes, the NPCs that you would meet and talk to would all be voice acted and we'll probably have some level of performance capture for them.It sort of depends, there will be the more generic people who won't have the same fidelity as the more specific NPCs that you may run across.But we'll have everything from more generic background characters, whether it's a bartender or something, to specific characters in the universe who we would actually do the same level of motion and facial capture on as we would do in Squadron 42.It's going to be pretty compelling and immersive hopefully, so we're gonna start shooting a lot of that in August or September of this year, both for the Persistent Universe, which is Star Citizen, and for Squadron 42.
