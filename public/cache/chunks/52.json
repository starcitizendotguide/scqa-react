First, we can use Quantum to balance the actual economy, by running it at real-time speed and feeding its data to the game, but also to test and validate future scenarios in advance by fast forwarding them in time to have an idea of their effects on the economy. Regarding the distribution curves, we can use directly the real-time price discovery data from the various entities (OHLC-Volume candles type for each product on the Bid and Ask side) from the Quantum simulation running in real-time. Another useful thing about Quantum is that it is a truly full simulation that is running, meaning that we can get data from each quanta individually if we wanted to. We can of course make NORM or GAMMA distributions out of that data, but we can tap into much greater detail if we want to. Each quanta live its own story in the simulation! Since there is so much happening in the simulation, the challenge is in finding the best way to get the relevant information from it. Aggregate type of information like distributions are interesting to get an overview, but another potentially even more interesting type of information is in investigating the behaviors of the Quanta.

You know, it\u2019s always been meant to be a spiritual successor to Wing Commander, we\u2019ve got Chris at the helm, and he\u2019s definitely following those traits to allow you to make the game that you always wanted Chris to make. But you know, there\u2019s been more modern technology introduced to games- Wing Commander is an older game, but the feel of Wing Commander is what we\u2019re going for with a mix of modern gameplay styles. So we\u2019ve already talked about all the stuff in Star Citizen with the FPS, the 3D graphics, and pushing the boundaries in our graphical representation.

I didn't even know about this story. What is this?Mark Abent: Oh this is a great story. So this happened roughly two years ago before we even launched Arena Commander. And we had our physics programmer John Pritchett, he flew out from Kansas, and we're working with him trying to get Arena Commander 1 out. Everything was going ... sort of working well, and then all of a sudden our ships just started acting weird: it would fly but it would go the wrong way and then you would just stop.RV: So like our missiles sometimes?MA: Worse. Actually our missiles were underwater but that's another story. But yeah ... and we're trying to figure out what's going on. And John Pritchett, he's debugging, debugging this, and he spent like two or three days because we're all still new at the engine, especially him, trying to figure out what's going on with physics: is it the game code, is it the thrusters, is it the ... whole big system?RV: Yeah.MA: And he finally figures out, he walks up to us and he goes, I still remember his face, \"Our ships are underwater!\" Everyone around just looks and goes \"Can you repeat that?\"[slightly hysterical laugh]\"Our ships are under water!\" And what happened is CryEngine by default, like if ...RV: Has water under everything. Under every single level in CryEngine has water.MA: If you think of an xyz plane you have [indicating each axis] x and then maybe y and then z up and down. So if this table was the xy and z up and down, anything below 0 would be considered \"water\". So any entity that went past 0,0,0 instantly got the water flag. So if you were flying up in here [above the table] but as soon as you go down here [below the table] you're in water.RV: Even though the plane was invisible because you can't really ...MA: Even though we got rid of terrain ...RV: Yeah.MA: ... and got rid of water for space you were still going under water.RV: Nice.MA: And it was a simple fix. It was just like really? Oh my gosh. And there's been many bugs like that but ... ugh ...RV: That's kind of awesome. I can see ... I can just see John's face too. Like \"By the way ...\"MA: \"By the way\"RV: \"This thing water. Everything's in it.\"MA: Yes.RV: Cool.MA: I don't even know how you knew that. But that was a good ... that was a good story. Alright, let's go on to our next question. So Mr Mortis Rigger. Oh that's good! We have ... I have to say before I go on to this question we have ... I'm going to get ... we have a guy named John and his last name is Riggs. So we call him Riggs the Rigger.RV: Yeah.MA: He doesn't like it.

The Reliant itself has a sort of vertical and horizontal mode and I would say potentially those could not necessarily be limited to landing and flying. Not sure about our very first flight implementation of how we're going to do that. Because default is horizontal for landing and vertical for mostly flying.But the idea would be, there would be reasons to for instance be horizontal. Say if you went down and were flying close to a planet and you wanted more of an atmospheric model, you'd probably want to be horizontal. And we're definitely going to allow you a lot more interaction with your ship and control of the flight modes and ICFS as time goes on. We're kind of in the middle of what we call this big item refactor we've talked about, that has a whole use ability factor in terms of being able to switch on your HUD, turn off power, or switch off various systems you would have and look around and interact in the cockpit.So when most of that functionality is on it will allow us to to allow you to have more control some of the features of, whether it's your flight system, or other features of your ships. So that would probably be, you potentially could have two stages of something like the Reliant where one it's just vertical for flying and then horizontal when it lands. Then later on when all that deploys, and we've still got to upgrade all the interactions and cockpits, you'll be able to maybe have more precise control of: \"Oh I'm in landing mode, i'm not in landing mode. Oh I'm in vertical mode or i'm in vertical flight mode or horizontal flight mode.\" But ultimately that is where we would be at. And the Reliant is actually is built to be able to fly in both modes. The Khartu-Al less so much, that's more about flies normally in the vertical mode and then deploys this way to land.

We're currently planning to allow you to customise your character or face sort of in game in fiction. In Squadron 42 you'll be able to do it and also we'll let you do it in the Persistent Universe. So if you go into one of these fancy medical facilities. Imagine it as a sort of futuristic plastic surgeon and you can reconstruct your face and you can go in the interface and determine what you want to look like and go into the machine and you'd come out looking like that. That's probably how we would do it. Don't know about releasing a stand alone generator.I know the Black Desert game did it and they've got a pretty cool character generator thing. We'll see but likely since the actual face generation and the Morph system and the whole facial setup we're using is very tied to CryEngine we probably, wouldn't be as easy just to do it in WebGL the same way we did the Star Map so it probably will be just based on client for now but you never know in the future but i'm guessing we'll probably just be client bound on that.", "published_at": "2016-02-01", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 76", "source": "https://youtu.be/GOyEcb5jJfE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Rando", "published_at_timestamp": 1454367842}, {"objectID": "11a62d043a77f6_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Like the Javelin's hangar, the number of ships allowed depends on the size of those ships, specifically.

If you have either successfully captured a ship with a boarding action or unsuccessfully and you've got some shot up team mates or you're shot up yourself, then you have to go and find some medical facilities in a certain period of time before you will bleed out and lose a life.That could either happen aboard a ship, or depending if you're a pirate, maybe some sort of dodgy back alley doctor, but we thought it would be a pretty interesting mechanic, so the answer to that question is yes.", "published_at": "2014-05-12", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 20.

You have to accept 'cause you also don't want people always abusing you and spamming you. And if you don't want to use voice chat, you can also be using text chat in a box.
