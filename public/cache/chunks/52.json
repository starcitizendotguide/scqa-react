It was discovered in 2855, when three workers assembling Providence Platform for the UEE Navy were startled by a stormwal rising from the depths of the planet's atmosphere, causing them to drop some of their tools. The stormwal is the largest known animal with the ability to fly. </p><br/><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1><br/><p>Some stormwals can reach 100 meters in length upon reaching adulthood. They are most commonly rosy-gray in color, with iridescent red fins and lightly-striped hides flecked with gold. Deep blue stormwals with blue-gray fins have also been observed. They have long, spade-shaped snouts and four eyes, two on each side of the head. Four long barbels trail off the head from the chin and the brow, which are used alongside the filaments on their pectoral, dorsal, and tail fins to sense the miniscule electrical fields of aeroplankton and kiami, their main prey. Four other elongated non-frilled fins are situated on the left and right side of the stormwal's belly. Six nostrils on either side of the snout and two enormous cavities just behind the head take in air that is internally distilled by specialized organs to contain only helium and hydrogen, which is then used to fill inner flight bladders that enable the stormwal to maintain flight. Excess air is expelled, and new air is taken in as needed. </p><br/><h1>BEHAVIOR AND ECOLOGY</h1><br/><p>Adult stormwals must eat between 1000 and 1500 kg of aeroplankton, kiami, small floaters, and other animals each day. They cooperate with their pods when hunting, flying in circles to force prey to concentrate in the center of an air vortex. The stormwals then take turns swimming into the trapped prey, taking huge gulps of air until they are sated. Solo stormwals often eat by diving into cloud formations that are densely-populated with aeroplankton. </p><br/><p>Electricity is vital to a stormwal\u2019s life cycle. To communicate, either to signal that a food source has been found, seek mates, call young who have flown too far from their parents, or simply to engage in bonding behavior, stormwals send electro-magnetic pulses to one another over long distances. When engaging in courtship, each stormwal will weave an intricate electro-magnetic pattern and transmit it to their prospective mate. This process can take several days. If either animal dislikes the pattern, they will break away from one another and seek mates elsewhere. </p><br/><p>Stormwal reproduction is a coordinated affair. Because they give live birth and stormwals do not land, a stormwal in labor must be watched by one or more other stormwals. When the squall emerges from its mother, one of the watching stormwals will catch it and let it rest, so that it has time to slowly fill its internal air cavities. Squalls that are not caught are in great danger of falling to their deaths. When the squall is finally able to float, it is returned to its mother, where it latches onto her mammary gland and feeds. It will nurse as its primary food source for up to two SEY. </p><br/><h1>IN CULTURE</h1><br/><p>Denizens of Orison consider the stormwal a symbol of their city. A large statue of a stormwal entitled \"Until Then\" by artist Biphasha Zhu sits in Cloudview Center, and the official mascot of the city, Finley the stormwal, can be purchased in plush form in local shops. Visitors to Orison can book tours to the nearby Stormwal Sanctuary, where they try to catch a glimpse of the animals in their natural habitat. </p><br/><p>In recent years, poachers have been spotted hunting and killing stormwals within the bounds of the Sanctuary, to the outrage of locals. Crusader Security has increased its presence in the area as a deterrent to further attacks.

First, we can use Quantum to balance the actual economy, by running it at real-time speed and feeding its data to the game, but also to test and validate future scenarios in advance by fast forwarding them in time to have an idea of their effects on the economy. Regarding the distribution curves, we can use directly the real-time price discovery data from the various entities (OHLC-Volume candles type for each product on the Bid and Ask side) from the Quantum simulation running in real-time. Another useful thing about Quantum is that it is a truly full simulation that is running, meaning that we can get data from each quanta individually if we wanted to. We can of course make NORM or GAMMA distributions out of that data, but we can tap into much greater detail if we want to. Each quanta live its own story in the simulation! Since there is so much happening in the simulation, the challenge is in finding the best way to get the relevant information from it. Aggregate type of information like distributions are interesting to get an overview, but another potentially even more interesting type of information is in investigating the behaviors of the Quanta.

But you know, there\u2019s been more modern technology introduced to games- Wing Commander is an older game, but the feel of Wing Commander is what we\u2019re going for with a mix of modern gameplay styles. So we\u2019ve already talked about all the stuff in Star Citizen with the FPS, the 3D graphics, and pushing the boundaries in our graphical representation.

I didn't even know about this story. What is this?Mark Abent: Oh this is a great story. So this happened roughly two years ago before we even launched Arena Commander. And we had our physics programmer John Pritchett, he flew out from Kansas, and we're working with him trying to get Arena Commander 1 out. Everything was going ... sort of working well, and then all of a sudden our ships just started acting weird: it would fly but it would go the wrong way and then you would just stop.RV: So like our missiles sometimes?MA: Worse. Actually our missiles were underwater but that's another story. But yeah ... and we're trying to figure out what's going on. And John Pritchett, he's debugging, debugging this, and he spent like two or three days because we're all still new at the engine, especially him, trying to figure out what's going on with physics: is it the game code, is it the thrusters, is it the ... whole big system?RV: Yeah.MA: And he finally figures out, he walks up to us and he goes, I still remember his face, \"Our ships are underwater!\" Everyone around just looks and goes \"Can you repeat that?\"[slightly hysterical laugh]\"Our ships are under water!\" And what happened is CryEngine by default, like if ...RV: Has water under everything. Under every single level in CryEngine has water.MA: If you think of an xyz plane you have [indicating each axis] x and then maybe y and then z up and down. So if this table was the xy and z up and down, anything below 0 would be considered \"water\". So any entity that went past 0,0,0 instantly got the water flag. So if you were flying up in here [above the table] but as soon as you go down here [below the table] you're in water.RV: Even though the plane was invisible because you can't really ...MA: Even though we got rid of terrain ...RV: Yeah.MA: ... and got rid of water for space you were still going under water.RV: Nice.MA: And it was a simple fix. It was just like really? Oh my gosh. And there's been many bugs like that but ... ugh ...RV: That's kind of awesome. I can see ... I can just see John's face too. Like \"By the way ...\"MA: \"By the way\"RV: \"This thing water. Everything's in it.\"MA: Yes.RV: Cool.MA: I don't even know how you knew that. But that was a good ... that was a good story. Alright, let's go on to our next question. So Mr Mortis Rigger. Oh that's good! We have ... I have to say before I go on to this question we have ... I'm going to get ... we have a guy named John and his last name is Riggs. So we call him Riggs the Rigger.RV: Yeah.MA: He doesn't like it.

The Reliant itself has a sort of vertical and horizontal mode and I would say potentially those could not necessarily be limited to landing and flying. Not sure about our very first flight implementation of how we're going to do that. Because default is horizontal for landing and vertical for mostly flying.But the idea would be, there would be reasons to for instance be horizontal. Say if you went down and were flying close to a planet and you wanted more of an atmospheric model, you'd probably want to be horizontal. And we're definitely going to allow you a lot more interaction with your ship and control of the flight modes and ICFS as time goes on. We're kind of in the middle of what we call this big item refactor we've talked about, that has a whole use ability factor in terms of being able to switch on your HUD, turn off power, or switch off various systems you would have and look around and interact in the cockpit.So when most of that functionality is on it will allow us to to allow you to have more control some of the features of, whether it's your flight system, or other features of your ships. So that would probably be, you potentially could have two stages of something like the Reliant where one it's just vertical for flying and then horizontal when it lands. Then later on when all that deploys, and we've still got to upgrade all the interactions and cockpits, you'll be able to maybe have more precise control of: \"Oh I'm in landing mode, i'm not in landing mode. Oh I'm in vertical mode or i'm in vertical flight mode or horizontal flight mode.\" But ultimately that is where we would be at. And the Reliant is actually is built to be able to fly in both modes. The Khartu-Al less so much, that's more about flies normally in the vertical mode and then deploys this way to land.

That's probably how we would do it. Don't know about releasing a stand alone generator.I know the Black Desert game did it and they've got a pretty cool character generator thing. We'll see but likely since the actual face generation and the Morph system and the whole facial setup we're using is very tied to CryEngine we probably, wouldn't be as easy just to do it in WebGL the same way we did the Star Map so it probably will be just based on client for now but you never know in the future but i'm guessing we'll probably just be client bound on that.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 76", "source": "https://youtu.be/GOyEcb5jJfE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Rando", "published_at_timestamp": 1454367842}, {"objectID": "11a62d043a77f6_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Like the Javelin's hangar, the number of ships allowed depends on the size of those ships, specifically.

If you have either successfully captured a ship with a boarding action or unsuccessfully and you've got some shot up team mates or you're shot up yourself, then you have to go and find some medical facilities in a certain period of time before you will bleed out and lose a life.That could either happen aboard a ship, or depending if you're a pirate, maybe some sort of dodgy back alley doctor, but we thought it would be a pretty interesting mechanic, so the answer to that question is yes.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 20.
