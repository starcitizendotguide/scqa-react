Where people will... since I come from a dev background and I'm transitioning over to Production it's kind of like that whole thing. Dev's will be like \"I'm not doing anything a Producer says unless they have a Jira and okay finders document\". And I'm like \"Yeah,I know these tricks. I've done them myself!\" It's like ... kind of like ...MA: You've turned against us. You're a spy.RV: I'm a pretty open spy though.MA: Your tactics of spying needs a little work.RV: So, yeah, no, it's like the transition's still going. I really do enjoy it. Of course, there are some things, like I hate scheduling. Oh my god, I hate scheduling so much. Because it such...MA: Oh yeah.RV: In this type of environment, to schedule for such... it's an asynchronous schedule because you guys are working on something completely different; the designers are working on something completely different.All the games that I've worked on before have all be regular MMOs or more standard MMOs, to where you have a zone and then you have all the quests that you are planning, you have everything else, so you have the progression. And you knew... we knew exactly what the progression was from level zero all the way to whatever level cap was. So it was easier for us to look at it.And I've always done production work in my other roles too because I've always been a Designer/Producer on some things. I've always made my own Jiras and stuff, I always had my own features that I was in charge of, so I've always run that.And when I was at 38 I think I had a team of nine people and I was the Scrum Master for the team, and I was running the features. I was in charge of the quest tool which, if anyone know about tools, like the quest tool itself touches everything in the entire game because everything is based on that. Then I had localisation stuff, I had some dialogue stuff, so I've always kind of done production stuff I've just never actually made it really official.MA: Yeah.RV: So it's... kind of... it's different. Different mentality: I'm still trying to... I still have that inner battle right now of like dev versus producer. But it's also cool because I can go into meetings with you guys and... like one of the producers, when we were talking about the doors... the doors meeting, right? We're talking all through the logic and everything like that and I understand it because I've done this before and I've been a dev for a while, but the other producer he's like \"I'm lost.\" And I'm like \"We're just talking about doors.\" He's like \"Oh\".MA: And then I think Sean walked up and he like, \"Just made a door!\"RV: Yeah, no, right? But even still I was able to talk logic and I'm able to give input and stuff and help facilitate that. So I have an idea of what the development team needs, granted I'm still working on it too because they always hit me up \"Hey I want to do this, I want to do this!\" \"Okay.\" Like  the other day you... I saw you, I'm in a meeting and I see Abent just pulling a whiteboard and I'm like... I'm like \"Hold on. What are you doing?\"MA: I needed to schedule things.RV: So then we started working on that together and putting the task up there and then making sure that at least the people he need to work with, which right now you are working with Patrick a lot, so make sure that they're always insync and they have one information and who's doing what task. Since they don't necessarily have same visions... visibility that I do.MA: We'll have the high end Jiras and you'll assign us like, \"Hey make the seat\" but there may be a bunch of things under that where I'll have to work with Patrick and go \"Alright, we have to plan this out of how are we going to do this. And to do we need any resources?\" Like Kirk I needed some stuff him to do so we could get the new item stuff working. Alright so that's another task, that's a task, that's a task. And it's just like...RV: Actually to be clear. So a producer is never development's boss.MA: Yes.RV: Their job is to facilitate and get... like to help them out to make sure they are not blocked so they can do their job. Because some people, they have the ... that are outside the game industry they have notion of, \"Oh, the producer's the boss\" and I'm like, \"No, the Producer is never the boss.\" Every time I make task it's based on discussions with Paul and you and the rest of the team. And being like, \"Okay, I'll set up the meeting\" and I'll be like, \"Alright guys, this is the goal that we want to do what are the tasks... what do we need to do with it?\" And you, Paul and everyone else are like, \"Okay, well to do that we need this, we need this, we need this.\" Then I start taking the notes and I start jotting down all that stuff. Then I turn those notes into actionable items so that way you guys can do the work. But you guys already have a better idea of exactly what takes to do that work. I just try to make sure that work is visible to now a larger audience that way other people can understand what you guys are actually working on and doing.MA: And to track it. \"What are they doing?\"RV: Yeah. Mostly communication, tracking.MA: \"I have no idea\".RV: Stuff!MA: Stuff.RV: They're doing stuff. And things.MA: We're making stuff work.

People would say \"go to this person for the best armor\" or \"go to that person for the best plasma blaster.\" Is their something similar planned for over clocking or production in Star Citizen?", "answer": "Calix Reneau: This is something that CR has brought up in meetings since I started here. That idea of being able to strike out and make a name for yourself in-game and doing it well, yes absolutely. The mechanics are still being determined with how that'll be expressed, but yes, the idea is there.Matthew Sherman: The biggest difference we'll have over something like SWG or a traditional MMO is that instead of having a weapon smith skill or an armor-making skill is it'll really be more about how much stuff have you broken and tinkered with to get that skill. Very much like real-world computer overclocking, you'll occasionally break something, but once you've really mastered how to make those parts to what you want, you can definitely make a name for yourself.CR: The goal is to try to balance a certain amount of art and science to get that exact amount of overclock performance without burning out an item too quickly.", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 08", "source": "https://youtu.be/j02lrXo3fXA", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Milton Friedman", "published_at_timestamp": 1462234019}, {"objectID": "373674670", "question": "What can we expect going forward with regard to yet to be placed into concept ships? Ships like the \"starter\" RSI Zeus to the rumored new pirate interceptor and the much speculated corvette?", "answer": "Well I don't think the RSI Zeus will be a starter 'cause it's an old legacy ship. I think it was one of RSIs first star faring ship. I think there's a model that you can get in your hangar for it. There is a fair amount of work we're doing. We've got some concept ships that we've looked at, and obviously we've got a few that we owe.So the corvette is basically the spot that the Idris left and that's going to be an RSI ship, we're calling the RSI Polaris at the moment. And then the pirate interceptor is to allow you to own a sort of quicker more maneuverable just straight dog fighting ship if you're a pirate because, the Cutlass is cool but it's kind of a jack of all trades. It can absolutely fight and it's pretty tough but it also carries people or a little bit of cargo around so it's maybe good for boarding actions and stuff like that. So it's almost a bit more fighter/dropship whereas if you're a pirate you may also need some interceptors and maybe you just don't want to be boarding a Hornet or something, so that's going to be the Drake Buccaneer that we're working on.But, yep there's a lot of cool stuff and the next one we are going to probably focus on is the much smaller mining ship. I know  people have been looking for ships that are not just necessarily combat orientated. And also rather different roles and with our procedural planets set up we've been looking at how we can have ships that can go down and maybe fly around, scan and pull in some minerals because we'll make that part of the gameplay when procedural planetoids roll out, which will be in the near future.So some of them will just be rocky planetoids maybe with minerals on, some will be a bigger planet with oceans and all the rest of the stuff on. But one of the things we think we could do in a large procedural area is look for minerals and basically mind for them and so the idea is the MISC Prospector will be a sort of one person version of that. Because the RSI Orion which is the big mining ship is very much built with some of the bigger mining operations in massive asteroid fields. It's a super cool ship but it's a really big ship and isn't so inclined to working down on the planetary surface stuff, looking and mining and strip mining materials. That's really what the MISC Prospector is.And the MISC Prospector's going to be built to pull up and gathering minerals and then maybe take the containers and put them on another ship, like one of the Hull classes, that you can fly off somewhere that needs some minerals. It should be pretty cool. So the design's coming along well and hopefully you guys will be excited. Non-combat ships I know a fair amount of people ask for that. I think it's one of the cool things with Star CItizen. It's not just about dog fighting or fighting other people, there will be many other ways to make money. Maybe there's people that have to protect the mining operation and there's people that are doing the mining operation and there will all be great ways to make money.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 81", "source": "https://youtu.be/n6g-ECx-7xw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Drewscifer", "published_at_timestamp": 1459807296}, {"objectID": "373675110", "question": "Within the context of fantasy space flight (Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, etc) and given how you're implementing the flight model in Star Citizen, how do you see the importance of positioning relative to an opponent playing out? Should there be an advantage to getting on your target's 'six' and staying there, or is that pretty much negated by 6DOF flight?", "answer": "I will say that in all circumstances even with 6DOF and the ability to do lateral, horizontal and vertical strafing as well as being able to change your orientation and maybe now your velocity vector, which is sort of the decoupled stuff. Always getting behind someone or in their blind side is always a bit of an advantage.Now the difference in our system and flight model. If you're a good pilot you'll be able to be able to get out of that situation. You'll have more options than you do in regular atmospheric air combat maneuvering.But obviously you want to get behind someone because they can't bring their guns, most guns are forward facing, also visibility is usually forward facing. So, outside of the bigger ships with turrets then getting behind people or swarming in a dogfight usually will give you an edge or an advantage even if they can recover from it quicker than they can in traditional current day atmospheric air combat.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 78", "source": "https://youtu.be/ciCNkp20O7w", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Krel", "published_at_timestamp": 1457391427}, {"objectID": "373679620", "question": "How will be able to land on an unexplored or uninhabited planet when populated planets bring you in on autopilot?", "answer": "All right so we obviously showed the procedural tech at the end of last year. The plan isn't really to have you go in on autopilot anymore, so the plan is whether it's a populated or unpopulated planet, if you're landing in a landing zone those ones would tend to be controlled. Just in real life you can't just fly into New York's airspace, they just don't let you do that right now. What we would do is we would have landing tunnels basically, so you would fly down from space to the surface of it and there would be a tunnel entrance, a virtual tunnel basically. So this is the designated lane you could approach in and then we need you to land on pad 18.You would communicate with the control centre for that landing area and they say, 'yeah, go ahead and land' and you would fly down there. So, as long as you fly inside the bounds of the tunnel and bring it down on the pad, great. The moment you would deviate outside it then the security flight control system takes over you ship and autolands it for you to basically prevent players from doing 9/11 stuff which is flying into buildings or trying to grief other players.That will tend to be on the populated environments and in general on the other areas, just like if you're landing down on a planet like a forest planet or something. If it's all our procedurally generated stuff, small areas of interest then it's kinda open to land where you want to land. That's actually one of the things we are most excited about, we're going to not necessarily have this huge four hundred billion star systems, that's why we're purposely keeping ourselves into a reasonable amount of star systems although hundreds is pry a lot but we're going to have more going on on the planets.So, one of the cool things with the procedural stuff which we're already working on which is far more than what we showed is having a planet that has Crysis level fidelity of vegetation and details, we'll have some wildlife and stuff. There will be places to go down and there will be an opportunity to do things like...collecting, mining minerals or hunting alien animals for their skins you can sell somewhere else or taking supplies to a small expedition outpost. I think there's going to be a lot of immersion gameplay that we're going to have and we're going to put up points of interest or areas that will which will mostly be procedurally created so the designer will basically work with the world with the procedural tech and create something he likes and then sort of set some rules for it and that will determine a lot of things you can do. I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity, it's pretty exciting and we'll be updating you as the year goes on that. Yeah, cool.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 74", "source": "https://youtu.be/qqcN6UkKfog", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "The Tick", "published_at_timestamp": 1451947767}, {"objectID": "373679990", "question": "How will insurance work for pirates? (trade routes, alien systems, being aggressor, etc)", "answer": "So we talked, when we first talked about insurance, that there was still the insurance cabal for the pirates but it's basically on the pirate worlds where you deal with, whoever the pirate insurance company would be, then you would be respawning back to a more outlaw or piratey planet but it would work more or less the same as people inside the UEE. It's kind of hard to say cause we have to balance the ins and outs cause we don't want people abusing insurance to be able to grief other people but we also want to make sure that if you lose your ship you have the ability to get back in the game without having too much of a penalty. We want you to have some penalty but not catastrophic penalty. I've mentioned before the Demon Souls example where I felt they really had a good balance between losing a lot of things but not losing everything and you really felt like when you actually managed to clear out a level or kill one of the end bosses that it was pretty risky to do it but when you did it you had a great sense of accomplishment and that's sort of the goal that we want.So insurance is in there to make it so you don't go out, the first time you get in combat you get your ship destroyed and bam I don't have a ship now what am I going to do? But we also don't want someone to just take their Aurora and ram it into someone, instantly get their ship ram it in again, instantly get their ship ram it in again, instantly get their ship ram it in again, cause that's not going to be a fun experience for everyone else. So I think we will figure out how to do it in ways that the more that kind of stuff happens you have more penalty, we'll look for patterns and we'll apply kind of the same stuff for pirates and we'll try to balance it but that's going to be very much in the playing and the testing of it, that's why I really like the process we use where we're sharing the game as we're building it with everyone and we're getting the feedback. I think the SC Alpha 2.0 is going to be an absolute, it's a gold mine for that, i'm already seeing what people are doing they're posting their videos and that's without being specifically stable. So it will be really interesting to see what evolves there and then that will help guide us on how we'll deal with stuff. We obviously have got an idea of what we want to do but obviously when we always say the best battle plans never survive contact with the enemy, not saying you guys are the enemy but, we need to play on that.So basically the answer is insurance for pirates will not be too dissimilar for insurance for people inside the UEE it will just be the sort of pirate version of that, and we are going to try and balance it so either side of it can't abuse insurance.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 71", "source": "https://youtu.be/QNGq1BkPINU", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Fuzzer", "published_at_timestamp": 1449529998}, {"objectID": "1fac51ab3b29d8_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The Avenger now comes with an alternate direct cockpit entry via a side ladder, which is available only on the current Warlock at the moment due to the EMP module totally blocking the rear entry.

If you see every aspect of it the whole sense of discovery won't be there, and that'll hurt the experience.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; We definitely want to keep a lid on the SQ42 aspects that are part of the story. Some of the general stuff like what does a Vanduul look like, that's fine. A lot of the specifics like locations, characters, even some of the ships you'll be on (flying or coming up against) we wanted to keep as a great discovery and surprise.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Reason # 2: We have a lot of stuff in development and just because of programmer finishes writing something doesn't mean we instantly put it out there. We have to test and polish it, refine it. When we think it's in a good enough state to for some objective feedback, we get it out there and see what people think. That's a big point for us. Programmers and artists here, it's a constant fight because they want their stuff to be perfect. We don't want to share stuff to early. It's pretty stressful for an artist if you share something too early that he knows has 20 problems with it, then every backer gets on a forum and points out those 20 problems. It's the same thing with Star Marine and why we aren't sharing the build right now which we play test every week.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; For those reasons, we think there are points where it's useful to share when the discussion will take it to places that we need that input on.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; We try to have these gates where internal development, we get it where we like it, then pass it to QA, after QA feedback to you guys, and you guys give us feedback and we take that back and work on it.

We don't really have a child character pipeline at the moment. So we may very well be guilty of what most other MMOs are. I would say if there were some children they would only be sort of background NPC stuff, kinda specifically just to add some variety to an environment. But yeah, we're really only planning on players being able to pick whether they want to be male or female - and it's an adult male or an adult female - and then sort of customize or dress up your character. NPC-wise is the only way you'll see a little bit of children, and that really comes down to variety.So it certainly won't be something that we would be doing at the very beginning, because we've got our hands cut out for us just doing the various characters and costume combinations and all the rest of the stuff.

It will be like the FBI most wanted list, or whatever you would have. The United Nation's most wanted list.Those will appear on...So we're planning to have a mission board that will be per-system. It's where you'd go to look for work, and that mission board would have certain sub-categories. So if you're a trader, basically a trucker, and you're like, \"Ok, I wanna haul cargo,\" you can go there and there will be jobs for you to either take cargo, paid per run, from here to here, and there will be jumps for you to fly someone else's ship.The same goes for bounty hunting. If you're a bounty hunter it will be like seeing the posted bounties, which is kind of what happens in America for bounties. The FBI or local police will have bounties out to bring in various people on the run. So there will be a global bounty hunting system that there will be benefits from.It won't just be going after people in space.

Because don't forget, you're gonna have to earn money to be able to pay for landing fees and fuel and all that kind of stuff, so I think that system will work, but we haven't fully, 100%, figured that out.There is something nice about the idea of a bunch of people coming after you if you haven't paid your loan back, but that may be a bit tough, and it would defeat the purpose, because you'd be blowing up the ship that they loaned you money for.Anyway, that part of is probably still to be decided.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 24.
