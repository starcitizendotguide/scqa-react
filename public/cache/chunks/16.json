Will it always have to be at a terminal or in-person, or could Players just wire-transfer the money instead?", "answer": "Currently, their \"Tier 1\" plan is that Players have to go to Terminals to pay off their fines. Elliot's not sure if there are any plans in the future to do wire transfers. Luke assumes that eventually, Players will be able to transfer money back and forth between each other (so wire transfers could be possible if they wanted to do that). They know that they want the kiosks to be there so that there's something physical for Players to hack. They can't speak to other features such as money transfers, but admit that it makes sense that if Players are able to wire transfer money anywhere, then the fines should be payable that way too. That said though, they definitely always want to have the physical method to be an option. So to reiterate, they're currently working on a terminal that will allow for fines to be paid off, and the other option is to go to Security Post Kareah or \"the UGF\" and hack away the fines (a quick search tells me that \"the UGF\" is a reference to HDSF-Elbridge, an Underground Facility on Hurston, but it's possible that any UGF would do?). They would also like to differentiate between the criminal database where all of a Player's felonies are kept, and the Fine Terminal which is more jurisdiction-ally based, and would require the Player to go to a relevant terminal within that jurisdiction to pay off those fines (like going to Port Olisar or Orison to pay off fines within Crusader's jurisdiction). Luke adds that they do want Players to be able to hack the Fine Terminals/kiosks, but because the local light security can't detect whether a Player's hacking or not, and the Armistice/Green zone prevents other Players from intervening, that functionality just doesn't fit right now. As such, they're keeping it to the Terminals at Kareah and other such places. This at least adds another layer of Player-choice and dilemma, because the Player will have to decide whether they want to hack away their fines or their felonies first. Jared adds that the whole \"money transfer\" feature isn't something the Mission Team handles, so they can't talk about it much, but reiterates that it's a feature that CIG wants to implement.", "time": "19m47s", "published_at_timestamp": 1564772763}, {"objectID": "a30546ffce220_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The Kraken is, in many ways, a mobile base.

A Crysis game has a very different demands than say a Star Citizen game.So yes definitely would want to be doing that.", "published_at": "2016-06-20", "title": "Star Citizen: 10 for the Chairman - Episode 85", "source": "https://youtu.be/9IubH4hHIFw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "NtrepiD", "published_at_timestamp": 1466460877}, {"objectID": "373673780", "question": "One of the charms of the original Wing Commander was that there was this one ship, the Scimitar, that almost nobody wanted to fly because it was widely regarded as slow and underpowered and obsolete. Granted, the team doesn't have the resources to deliberately design a flyable 30th century Edsel for Star Citizen, but have you thought about including stuff like that as, say, NPC background ships, or maybe having the lore categorize as 'marketing failures' ships that got rendered obsolete in their original function by evolving game mechanics?", "answer": "Ben Lesnick: Short, short answer. Yes, absolutely. In fact Dave here has done some of the early ship stuff down back to the Zeus early on.Dave Haddock: Oh right. Right, right, right.BL: It's more a time of... a point of, how can we work these into the schedule. We also kind of have this idea that our existing ships are going to age. You'll have the 2943 Aurora that is the model that is 5 years old, someday 10 years old. We, as we mentioned in another question, we are going back and saying, \"Okay, here's another ship that would've existed back then.\" So de-aging, or re-aging existing ships is an option.We do want to build more and more ships into the background of the lore. As we get to the point where ships kind of go directly into the game, rather than going through this whole concept sale, proposal idea we can do some more 'less popular' ships that won't sell.DH: Right, right.BL: I will also note that for the example of Wing Commander though, and this is the power of lore, the Scimitar... everyone hates the Scimitar, everyone who played the game remembers hating the Scimitar. The Scimitar is bad. It's only bad because one of the characters, several of the characters, repeatedly tell you it's bad in the game. It's actually the second best ship in the game.DH: I kind of liked flying the Scimitar.BL: Yeah. It's the guns, you have a constant recharge...DH: That was the big mass driver one, right?BL: Yes, it's the one with the mass drivers. It's so much more pleasant than the Hornet, and I have an even easier time with it than the Rapier.DH: Right, right. Yeah, I mean it's also important to note that I mean like, you know, an old ship and a new ship are basically equal in difficulty to create. You have to go through as many steps. Whether the ship is 50 years old, or is supposed to be the new cutting edge thing, sort of from a production standpoint they're basically the same, it requires the same amount of work. So it's, you know, I think right now we're being a bit more, like Ben said, we're being a bit more surgical about what type of ships we're coming out with.BL: But that is part of why we give ships a lineage. It's never just... sometimes it is, \"Here's the totally new ship,\" but a lot of times, \"Oh here's the Retaliator, and it has a hundred year history with the UEE.\"DH: Right, right.BL: We're kind of planning that in.DH: Yeah.", "published_at": "2016-05-30", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 12", "source": "https://youtu.be/Iydp3X56hpk", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Jacknife", "published_at_timestamp": 1464634147}, {"objectID": "373674220", "question": "Are there any new animations or physics effects that you have been working on and the challenges that you have encountered?", "answer": "Forrest Stephan: There's so much. Sean Tracy: Right, there's so much to do with animations and physics together...FS: Where to begin.ST: It's a system that is completely interwoven. Evo Hertzig does a lot of work on this particular system, as well as a gentleman by the name of Chris Rahm. What we've been working on constantly is the zero G driven ragdoll kind of technology. This is pretty unique to our game and the driven ragdoll itself isn't unique but the transition between animated character to driven ragdoll back and forth, back and forth and going within physics grids and things like this. There's a lot of problems, and a lot of challenges that that brings. It might not be super obvious to the players, that we are working on things within there.FS: Right.ST:  From what they see, \"Oh, yeah it all works.\" There's little things that we want to fix within that. So, the other sort of portion of this, that's been very tricky actually to be working on, is the skeleton extension portion of this; has a little bit to do with the new item port system. What happens with the new item port system? You start as a base skeleton, then you add let's say a head or helmet. That skeleton actually extends. FS: Right.ST: So we have a skeleton within the head that has a shared root. That actually extends as the  base skeleton. We then deal with that as a normal character. So, what's tricky about that is that we've got to figure out a way, we've worked on it quite a bit last week before Evo went on holidays, to rebuild that physics skeleton without completely rebuilding it... FS: Right.ST: It's one of the things that takes the longest time on the CPU. That is to then be synchronized to all the players. FS: Right.ST: So yeah, that's kinda what we're working on within there. We want that driven ragdoll to be affected. We want, as we add different skeleton extensions on, to extend the skeleton physically as well. FS: Yeah. It's just so much to think about. I mean...ST: Absolutely. FS:  You're in one physics environment then when you enter a ship, you enter another physics environment, right? Then what happens if you're ragdolling from one physics environment into the next physics environment. Then have you turning back into your regular animation.ST: Exactly.FS: There's just so much to think about.ST: The relative space of that moves so often. We have a World Space, the Local Grid Space, the Zone Space.

Definitely the better or the deeper fixing up, which is what we call targeted healing, will require some element of skill. So, the simple one is bam, med pen, just give myself a quick... whatever... whatever in the future we're doing it - the sort of cortisone, steroid boost... adrenaline shot gets you back into it - but to actually do repairs some greater damage we're going to have a certain amount of skill in terms of targeting and being able to apply it and all the rest of the stuff.I would say to a certain level we probably have that on a more complicated repairing as well. Maybe if you're patching up a hole or something like that we... is the same kind of idea of mechanics for we've been talking about for mining where there's a certain amount of skill in drilling, using a laser at a certain frequency, gauging how much your frequency is, kinda what the vibration of the rocks that you are drilling into, whether you are possibly penetrating some dangerous gases or the rest of the stuff.So, we will try to have some of the higher level stuff requires some skill and the lower level stuff like I said, just a med pen is bam, pop it, give you a sort of short-term boost.

We are discussing that now. However for the most part, the, we are deciding which ships are planetside landing capable or not when we design the ships. One interesting  topic that came up was, for some of the snub nose or smaller fighters, we are deciding to either make them Quantum Travel capable or atmospheric landing capable. As a trade off between for having such a small ship you need to pick one that suits the needs that you are looking for.This is especially important when we have ships that are capable of carrying smaller ships. The Connie is an example of one, though the Merlin doesn't actually function on it yet, but when it does, you'll get the capabilities of what the Merlin is able to do when that comes online. For other ships that have snub nosed fighters for example or a carrier ship you can decide Well you know what I really wanted to park this carrier outside of a planet and then go down to the planet surface using all these smaller atmospheric landing capable ships.Or what I really want are a bunch of say like taxi style vehicles that allow you to shoot across the galaxy and then meet up with other ships very quickly. You'll need to make a decision. So as we design each ship we are deciding whether or not they are Quantum Travel capable and atmospheric landing capable. So these are things we're deciding and it's on a ship by ship basis.When will we get to see this? Well that's a great question! We're still, we're working on these we're making these ships as fast as possible however all of the ships that are medium size or larger are definitely going to have interiors that you can walk around in. I discussed earlier things like being able to access the components from the inside. That's going to be a big thing and so yes there will be interiors that you can walk around with, walk around in. And then interact with other crew members, components, systems. There will be standards things we have like beds, bathrooms, etcDV: We want to give players a reason to walk around these large ships. A reason why you want to walk down this hallway and open this door and other than just, besides having the reason of just having a large ship. We want to give you guys a reason to walk down that hall, open the door, access this panel. Apart from just being for that reasonKT: And then we'll need to make decisions such as how do we make modular components for these ships so, at least on a ship level for well when we create a ship like an Idris, it's impossible to fill every square inch of that thing with custom geos so we need to figure out what a standard hallway is, what a standard room is like, what the engineering station is going to be like, what the, if there's an engine housing room, if there's a cargo area that we can make modular and place on several parts of the ship if there are landing areas for that ship how do we figure.We make choices so that we can make a ship that's functional and is within reason schedule wise because we want to create the best as quickly as possible these are things we consider when we are designing and ultimately building the ship from nothingness to something that we can actually see in the gameDV: Let me give two examples. For those who are anime fans look at the Cowboy Bebop anime series. you've got the Bebop ship that carries: spike's, swordfish. And you've got also Faye and Jet's smaller ships. They use the Bebop through Warp Gates carrying those ships even though the Bebop can land trans-atmospherically it still has smaller ships that it can with it.But if you look at something like Battlestar Galactica where they have giant fleets of ships and some of them are orbital space stations that are jump capable but something that is shaped like a ring or like an orbital station is not going to be able to land so you want to have shuttles and lighter ships, well they're called lighters, that can go inbetween ship to ship or trans-atmospherically up and down.We'll even have orbital docking yards where you get up from there and you take a taxi or a shuttle back down to the surface. It's ultimately going to be decided by what that gameplays need is, what the ships functionality is going to be is, what the role that ship is going to fill. So ultimately there's going to be an ultimate large size of what ships can land something like...KT: I don't think we've made that decision yet. I think we're going to decide on those capabilities based on the role of the ships. \"What is that ship made for? What is the reason to own that ship?\". Then we'll make a decision about those particular characteristics at that pointDV: Right.

Do some members of your team get over enthusiastic? How do you keep the artists, writers, and designers from implementing so much detail on ships, stations, planets, or characters that they risk derailing the production schedule? Have you avoided hiring less experienced people because you don't have time to train them how to avoid issues like those described above?", "answer": "Lisa Ohanian: I want to address the second part of that first...Darian Vorlick: That's what producers are for!LO: Yeah, that's what we're for.  If we have to avoid hiring good people that means we're not doing our job.  We have definitely not avoided hiring less experienced people.  Like, actually have a very high number, for a AAA studio, of people who are a little on the less experienced side but have the talent and the know-how and they just maybe don't have that credit yet and it's kind of their first big break which is really exciting and it also kind of brings &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; even though you have to rein in on certain things, it also brings a really unique perspective.  Whereas, someone who has been in the industry tackling a certain problem for 10 years now, you might get someone else who comes in and maybe they don't have all of the experience to bring to the table but they have a fresh perspective or spin on how to tackle this problem or how to solve this thing in front of you.  We have, like I said, a slightly higher number than average of less experienced people but the talent is there and that's kind of what we look for first I think... and we do have a lot of experienced people mixed in.  I actually think it's a really exciting mixture of people that we have here.DV: So, that's largely what producers are for &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; to keep everybody on track.  But, to break down how our organizational hierarchy is, at least within the development side &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; I'm going to use the design team as an example &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; We have our design lead Dan Tracy, within the LA office what he does is he helps kind of steer what features we're going to be working on and how to break those down into individual tasks to make it a lot more manageable.  So, for example he may task Calix Reneau with writing the design brief on something and he may then give it to Kirk Tome to make that particular... using a ship, he would make it flyable.  Matt Sherman may be working on the components of that ship.  So, everybody does have their responsibilities on what they're going to be doing but those tasks are then going to be broken down by the lead and what production does is make sure people are staying on those tasks.  LO: Just to chime in, the funny thing I think is we probably have that problem... well... problem...  We probably see that coming from Chris Roberts most because he has so many ideas in his head and such a vision for this world that we'll see him bringing up these awesome ideas and we'll say, \"Oh, that's so great!  This is what it's going to mean...\" And then we get to make an educated decision about how soon and how we want to implement something.  DV: But on top of that, I mean... when you have a room full of very creative people, they want to work on everything at once.  So, you may have one designer who is working on one specific feature &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; once he is done with that design brief he may be completely filled with creativity at this point and be like, 'I just want to starting working on this and then I'll work on this,' which starts to deviate away from the main goal of whatever fix version or patch we're trying to work towards.  So, it's up to the design lead and the producers to say, 'You still need to work towards this direction.  Once we're done with that, maybe we can actually squeeze that little bit of creativity in.'  So, they are creative people but it's our job to keep them on track.  LO: It's an art and a science working with leads to make sure people get an appropriate amount of time &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; not too little and not too much.DV: Yup.  Because if you don't let them spend some time on it, they get a little burnt out.  So, you do want to make sure they're getting &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; I don't wanna say rewarded, it's not like a doggie treat or something &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; but we do want to make sure that they have the ability to exercise that creativity while still maintaining a goal and perspective on where we're trying to get in the game.", "published_at": "2015-08-17", "title": "10 for the Producers: Episode 11", "source": "https://youtu.be/9y1X4tLFdU0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "AragornBH", "published_at_timestamp": 1439849467}, {"objectID": "373681880", "question": "What is the in-game banking structure going to be like?

Wiring credits to other citizens, we are going to allow some level of transfer of money between players, but it'll probably be limited like it would be in the real world here. You can't just willy-nilly wire lots of money to people without having documentation for that, and there are things like wire fees and all the rest. We haven't fully figured out the mechanics of players trading cash between each other, because there are some ways the system can be abused if people abuse the people are trading, or giving each other cash, and also the transfer of cash itself, in the game system, is going to be based on the reality of the system. It's not like you instantly transfer an asset or money to someone, and then they instantly have it on the other side of the galaxy. For instance if I was going to trade one of my ships, and it's an in-game ship, I'd actually have to get my ship to the person I was giving it to, or he would have to come pick it up. And we're hoping there'll be gameplay revolving around that, where people will be transporting other people's ships, or they'll take a job to transfer someone to deliver it to the person that's buying it, so on some level I think cash and money transactions will be slightly the same, we haven't figured out all the mechanics of that, but we're going to try to take some leads from what happens in the real world, and also use that to sort of help create some gameplay.Early days, and I'm sure Tony Zurovec has some ideas on that.

Every developer super different. As a producer, it is difficult to get accurate estimates out of people until you know them so the more time you spend with them and the more you can go like - ok, so 4 hours for him really means 2 or 4 hours for him really means 8. It's not like one is slower or faster, it's literally just the way they think about how long it'll take.Eric Kieron Davis: Yeah, we talked about this I think on jmack's question, the better you understand your team the easier it becomes. These teams that have worked together for years and years and years you know exactly what they mean or you don't even have to do it, a lot of times I would get to a sense after working with a certain team for a certain amount of time I could pre-fill their bids. Obviously, you would talk to them afterward to make sure they're accurate but you know: I know it usually takes Jennifer three weeks for that, you know it takes... there is a science to it and that science is understanding your team and then also understanding the project you're working on.TD: Yeah and knowing what the technical details of what they are doing. We got to a point, during the 1.0 crunch for example, 90% of the tasks that came through I could assign what I thought was a pretty good value and then look at it with the guys and they'd be - yup, yup, yup, cool. Another fun game to play for any aspiring producers out there, is play the, \"What if?\" game with anyone who's giving you an estimate, especially the longer the task, if it's a 2-3 week kind of a thing - yeah, we could probably do it in 3 or 4 weeks and it's like oh, you feel like taking a day off? What if you get sick? What if your dog gets sick? You know, it's kinda evil, all these bad things that can happen in your life that could derail you but there's a lot of things that people don't account for, it's totally natural. They've actually done studies on it and I've read them in books which - books like Drive by Daniel Pink - which are great.EKD: That's a great one, yeah.TD: Anyways, you as a human being have a natural predilection to underestimate a large task and overestimate a small task and so you can apply some baseline modifiers mathematically so back to your, is it calculable? Average good one is everybody works about 70% of an 8 hour day between going to the bathroom, eating lunch and blah, blah, blah so that's another one you can look at. If I have 40 hours of tasks that's going to be about a week and a half worth of work so there's little things like that you can do mathematically and the rest is there is gut, especially when you're looking at the finaling of a project you can see, oh okay what's our burn down saying - how many bugs entered versus how many resolved. You go, okay what's our rate of increase and change in that and you can start to do your own little math that says - ok, we'll probably be around this date - I remember for Arena Commander 0.8, I knew in order ship we needed to get all critical and majors done and so I just applied that math and I think the date was May 30th and we ended up going on June 4th.EKD: Not bad.TD: That was back in like March.EKD: That's not bad.TD: I was actually quite proud of that one. [laughs]EKD: Well done.TD: So it's both - it's math and gut.EKD: You know to that point - I think experience, the reason they say the more time you're in something, this goes with any kinda job, the more time you're in something the more comfortable you get with that information so the more experience you have whether it's with a team or just working in an industry or working with a certain type of product, maybe you just always make FPSs, the better it is for your bidding and your gut then reacts to that experience but the one thing I challenge people on with that experience is to always still start with experience, start with that knowledge but then add to it, break it, don't just... a lot of producer's get stuck in that.TD: You sit in your zone.EKD: Yeah, it's like the technology is constantly changing, new fantastic talent is coming out of college, right. There's new things that people are out there doing with a smaller team than you've ever done 20-30 years ago...TD: Entirely new ways to manage your time.EKD: You got it, so be agile enough to move with that stuff but you know, a good foundation of experience is good.

Early in the design for the FPS mechanic we were talking a lot about EVA, what advantages or disadvantages different suits had, one of them was a radiation protection rating that would limit your ability to stay in EVA permanently so you can't just float around forever. So we have the concept of life support, but also the idea of radiation that could build up over time to a toxic level. Different types of suits would be rated differently for different types of radiation. We've also talked about, on the Arena Commander side, different hazards that you could have, both in the gameplay environment but also in the PU, things like nebulas, solar flares, and other kind of time-sensitive or system impacting natural hazards, like what you're talking about.Ricky Jutley: And another thing we kind of, I'm just imagining now, if you turned up with your suit at a particular area, a nebula or an area that had a particular gas cloud that you were surrounded by, and you believe that your suit is able to combat that kind of area, and another person flies in and they're trying to get into your area, but they get totally wiped out, those kind of things are going to be really cool, just to make sure the player is on their toes of knowing what different suits do, different areas and different environments and how they can kind of affect your gameplay.TD: Yeah and one of the mission types, cause we've started talking about the concept of the mission generator, or the instance action sphere generator, and some of the mission types we've talked about have been, oh, there's a disabled constellation that is floating towards the sun and it's not under power but there's a high radiation level, so you have very limited time windows in which you can interact with it to try and reconstitute it, rescue it, or just go to hell with it and let it fly into the sun.

One - Is it easy to access that and make sure that you don't have to do five different hotkeys to get into that throttle but also making sure that you get out of it quick enough and that's not a weird sticky context.Pete Mackay: We're definitely exploring some methods by where your throttle is not so sensitive, so you're not going from huge amounts of thrust with small changes to your throttle input. So, a good example would be: In congested areas where you don't necessarily... you know, you want a bit more fine control over your throttle. So we're definitely looking at ways of scaling the throttle itself.", "published_at": "2015-05-11", "published_at_timestamp": 1431381621, "question": "Would it be possible to link the force of the directional thrusters to the throttle, down to a minimum force?", "source": "https://youtu.be/4RzDfTpTWtA", "title": "10 for the Designers: Episode 03 (2015.05.11)", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Rhapsody", "time": "3m48s"}, {"objectID": "373683130", "question": "When it comes to clothing for our characters, are you designing them with the expectation that we'll be able to change their colours, patterns, and materials?  What sort of challenge has the idea of users customizing things presented to you?", "answer": "Lance Powell: the short answer is yes.  Those are things we're going to be doing...customization across the board is something we've been focused on for a long time.  So, the ability to change your skin, the shape of your body, the clothing from the shoulders down to the ankles, the types of accessories, those have been on the books for a while.  The challenges we've come up with so far aren't with the customization per say, but it's how we're using the technology and the customization.  So for example, a lot of the technology that we're using for cloth simulation is from Ryse.  Ryse did some things beautifully, and to take that to the next stage means we have to encounter brand new tech issues.  So the nod that we're taking from film is to take basically a normal type pattern for a shirt for example, not just the textural pattern but how is it cut, how is it stitched, so as you're doing your simulations, it actually starts to fold and sit as you'd expect it to.  Something we're actually starting to look at at this particular moment.Elwin Bachiller: And are we going to be doing that real-time?LP: Real time.  So that's another thing we're looking at, which is the fidelity of the cloth simulation.  The portions of the game that are coming out soon won't reflect that, but the long term picture will have that stuff.  So the characters will be completely customizable, the simulations that the characters have on them will be a mixture of something very simple and something very complex, like the eyeballs looking at center-mass chest, we'll probably put some more fidelity into those areas, but those are still up in the air.  But, in terms of the ability to fine tune your character, you're going to have a lot of flexibility.", "published_at": "2015-04-28", "title": "10 for the Artists: Episode 01 (2015.04.28)", "source": "https://youtu.be/mODLgO4DgwY", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Amontillado", "published_at_timestamp": 1430219413}, {"objectID": "373677920", "question": "Will there be different grades of fuel? Think 87, 89, 93, 99 octane. Could there also be different grades of jump fuel?", "answer": "Yes, there are going to be different grades of fuel, not so sure there'll be different grades for basic manoeuvring, but the boost fuel will be more compressed or compact than the regular fuel, as will be jump fuel, so those will be more expensive than regular fuel, might take more work to refine, the general manoeuvring fuel is much easier to sort of scoop up around gas giants. We're in the process of sorting out that system now, I'd imagine the boost fuel is most expensive (maybe jump?). There could be a base kind of boost fuel, and a more premium grade fuel that could be rarer from different stars, it's all on the cards. People could make a business out of collecting and refining fuel, it's resource management and it'll be kinda fun. There will probably be the basic kind of fuel, then if you're that kind of guy/girl that likes to tweak their ships they might only use premium fuel for that little bit of a performance increase at a cost.", "published_at": "2014-11-17", "title": "10 For the Chairman: Episode 45 (2014.11.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/qXwybQaAbbs", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Emulator", "published_at_timestamp": 1416257116}, {"objectID": "373678730", "question": "How much variation will there be in AI response? If I have a random encounter with a group of AI pirates, will they ever choose to run rather than attack? If I have killed half their team, will they try to disengage and cut their losses?", "answer": "Yeah, we are trying to have some fun/more human-like AI, so I definitely think there will be cases where the AI will chose to flee rather than fight you, perhaps if your reputation is really strong, or they really feel like you've got them outgunned. If the tide is turning and you've taken out half their strength they might re-evaluate and turn to run. Kythera is the middleware we're using and being developed hand in hand with SC, which is going to be really good for that.

Won't necessarily be about speed though.
