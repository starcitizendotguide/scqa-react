On 24 June 2610, after a catastrophic defeat in the Centauri System at the hands of Squadron 42, it became clear to Corath\u2019thal and his forces that they could not defeat the UEE military and an armed populace. Faced with the choice between surrender and death at the hands of his enemy, Corath\u2019Ttal chose a third option: he ordered his surviving loyal forces to charge through the UEE military blockade for Elysium.</p><br/><h1>Subject</h1><br/><p>On 25 June 2610, the remains of the Tevarin fleet reached Jalan\u2019s atmosphere. The residents of the planet braced for an attack. Instead, Corath\u2019thal and his fleet dropped their thermal shields and dove for the planet. As they burned in the atmosphere, Corath\u2019thal\u2019s final words were picked up by human communication devices: \u201cWe die at home, and we die free.\u201d</p><br/><h1>Artist</h1><br/><p>Aaron Fring was born on Ferron on 13 October 2578 to teacher Max Fring and pilot Mary Fring. He learned to draw and paint as a child, during a period in which he was bedridden with Kilos\u2019 Malady. As an adult, his illness prevented him from following his mother into service with the UEE Navy, so he joined the UEE Expeditionary Force (UEEEF) as a Field Medic. The UEEEF eventually stationed him on Jalan. He fell in love with the landscape there and was inspired to resume painting. The night of Corath\u2019thal\u2019s descent, Fring was taking an evening walk, having left all his communication devices at his home. As he approached the crest of a hill, he noticed strange lights in the sky, and saw the first of the Tevarin fleet push through the clouds. Fring watched until the last of the ships had either broken apart or crashed. He began work on Tears of Fire the next day.</p><br/><p>The debut of Tears of Fire at the Gemma Gallery of Art launched Fring\u2019s career as a full-time painter. He went on to produce more pieces centered around the Tevarin Wars, to continual acclaim. His portrait of Corath\u2019thal, referenced from holos and oral descriptions, is noted for its use of smoke and lighting. He died on 11 November 2631 from Kilos-related complications, aged 53 years.

Mark goes on to say that CR (Chris Roberts) is an amazing programmer who has a nice little stream (of code I presume?) where he's changing a lot of the underlying ways of how they attach things, and he has the support of a lot of the Lead Programmers and Engine Tech. So in this stream, he's changing how the Devs attach things to-and-from different things, and one of the problems with the current tech is that, if they want to attach a ship to another ship, a whole slew of problems arise because the ship has an interior physics grid with a bunch of Object Containers, and if you attach it to another one of those, the code doesn't handle it very well and it has problems. So in that stream, he has provided a way to fix those issues, so that a ship could be attached to another ship and it would work as you would expect. If that tech gets past QA and they fix some of the bugs that have resulted from it, it would open up the doors to give them the ability to attach a ship to a ship, so you could dock a ship directly on another ship. For example, on the Constellation there's a fake Merlin atm because they don't have this docking ability yet, but if they get this tech in and working then they could do this properly. The other part of the problem is persistence, where if they do Dock two ships then they have to have some sort of game code understand that they have some sort of ship docked to another, so that when they're streamed-out and streamed back in, the states and connections are established. Then there's the other aspect of gameplay: what does it mean to dock a ship to another ship? Does the interior atmo need to be vented, or do they need to decompress? So it's coming, and once all the pieces are together then more might be said about Docking.", "published_at_timestamp": 1558137330}, {"objectID": "efc2c46596d58_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Correct and these two categories suit the role of the ship perfectly.", "published_at_timestamp": 1554242400, "question": "What are the component classes available to this ship?

I'm talking high power in close range and low powered scatter at long range with potential to maim ship components, clear lesser asteroids, take out EVAers like they're clay pigeons.", "answer": "Alright, so I get it on the not so accurate side, with the not so accurate spread weapon there. I think that's a pretty good idea. I know that, to my knowledge, we don't have a shotgun style weapon for a ship on the schedule in the immediate future. I would say that would be an interesting type of ballistic weapon that you could have for short range stuff. Therefore people trying to EVA you it's sort of like an antipersonnel weapon you could deploy, and kind of a wide hitting component damage on a ship up close would be pretty interesting. It's a good idea, so I think we can put that into the hopper.I will say that as we start to finish up all the components, the implementation, and we move towards the persistent universe where things like ammunition whether it's your ballistic weapon ammunition, or missiles, there will be fuel, all things that will be consumables basically, when you're flying around you're going to have to earn money by getting missions. So if you fire all the rounds from your gatling gun, or you fire your missiles, you're going have to spend some UEC, or Alpha UEC in the pre-final SC-Alpha version of the game, to replenish them.What's really going to happen is we're going... the idea would be that the ballistics and the missiles are actually quite effective, probably more effective than an energy weapon. Of course energy weapons don't have the same ammunition... they don't have a finite amount of ammunition, or a finite amount of shots, you can keep on firing them as long as your power plant is active, and you have enough power, and you're not overheating. What should be the case is that the ballistic weapons, and the missiles, are in fact more effective in the future when we will make this adjustment, once they become sort of perishable as you have finite amounts of ammunition.The gameplay should be you sort of juggle between either your energy weapons, or your ballistic weapons, or your missiles, and you use them depending on situations. So if you want to really do some damage quickly, and not get held up by shields for instance, which is one thing you do get with ballistic weapons is that they sort of penetrate through shields. Then you would use ballistics, the downside of using a ballistic is obviously that you have a finite amount of ammunition and you'll have to go and replenish it when you get into the next space station, or land at the next landing area. We want that kind of juggle between them, it'll be kind of cool.Having some cool different ballistic weapons would also be interesting, like a sort of spread shotgun weapon. I think there will be more weapon management by players in the persistent universe going forward. Especially once we have persistence in, consumables in, things like wear and tear, and all the rest of the stuff that we're going to be starting to roll out over the rest of this year that will allow you to manage your components and equipment better and have different strategies depending on the situation you're in. I think that's going to make for a much more interesting long-term game.What you see right now in Arena Commander, or potentially what you see now in SC-Alpha, in terms of weapon management isn't really what it's going to be once more of the features and persistence is in. Of course, the first stage of persistence will be the next release, and over the subsequent releases we'll flesh it out more and more.

Currently for our game, I think it's the light marine is stationing a lot of the stuff. A lot of our ships. And the reason why is just the size. The pilots, not the pilots, the light marine is pretty much almost our base male, and so when we design our seats and everything, there's a specific size right, and so a heavy marine will have a lot of gear and he won't fit in those specific, those chairs. And also I was talking with Randy I think a couple of days ago and he was saying that light marine is a certain height, and the heavy marine is literally almost touching the ceiling of the Cutlass I think, or some ship, so there will be limited access to pretty much the size of your armour, so you won't necessarily see a heavy marine driving a Merlin.Will Weissbaum: We have like flight suits distinctly designed for pilots that don't have as much protection and are more flexible, so might be the kind of thing that you have to literally suit up before you plan on heading into battle.JL: Yeah, right...WW: Or carry people who aren't pilots on your ship who are suited up to protect you.JL: They're just cargo.WW: And I think we've talked about like, potentially maybe limiting what you can physically sit down while you're wearing like, if you have a giant gun strapped to your back you might not be able to get into certain seats anyway without taking it off and putting it into storage before you go in, so that kind of role playing elements is pretty neat.JL: So, to answer that question, it's really depends on the size of the character, and depends on the, pretty much if you have giant stuff on, you can't sit on a chair. It's like, yeah.WW: Once we start allowing the mixing and matching of different pieces, it'll see where that kind of breaking point is.JL: Right, that's the scary part is the... [laughter]WW: We'll have to figure that out.JL: Yeah, we'll have to figure that out later.WW: Really beefy legs and like, no shirt, that's how I'm gonna fly.JL: How come I can't sit?

Is a Gladius only going to be able to perform one jump while a Sabre can perform 3? What about the larger ships?", "answer": "It's too early to be definitive on this but yes obviously different ships will have the ability to have different ranges. Quantum fuel is a separate resource to the boost/afterburner fuel and obviously the amount of Quantum fuel you have combined with the efficiency of the drive you have which essentially is a modified Quantum Drive and the distance you're going to have to do in the jump through the wormhole will affect how far you can go. The smaller ships that have jump drives probably will not be able to go as far without having to re-fuel or collect some more fuel, bigger ones will be able to carry on going for much further distances. We're expecting a fair amount of gameplay long term for players that want to be flying their Starfarer around and selling fuel to people or there will be refuelling stations and all the rest of the stuff. But I would say the smaller ships have a much shorter range before they have to refuel versus the bigger ones, so there you go!", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 69", "source": "https://youtu.be/AiTY_K7bDys", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Folka", "published_at_timestamp": 1447110918}, {"objectID": "373681090", "question": "During the Dragoncon Q&A, Ben mentioned that the MISC Endeavor draws inspiration from the Valley Forge in the movie Silent Running.

You've seen the Constellation commercial which is an absolute homage to 2001 with the very famous time cut of throwing the bone up and turning into a space station and a ship docking with a space station and I definitely think that you'll see lots of sci-fi homages whether it's to Star Wars which obviously a fair number of people here are fans of.  Things like Battlestar Galactica.  Things like Firefly/Serenity, Aliens, Alien, Blade Runner.  I mean, you can see some of the stuff that we've been doing for ArcCorp and you can think, \"Ah... maybe a little bit of Blade Runner.\"  Today I was just looking at some stuff.  We were kind of playing around with some ship ideas and designs and we were looking at the Eagle in Space 1999.  So, yeah there will be lots of stuff out there.  There's plenty of great sci-fi movies.  You know, there's some other stuff... Like, I don't know if any of you guys have seen Sunshine &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; that's a Danny Boyle movie, it's actually quite an underrated movie.  It's really good and it had a really great ship design in it.All I can say is, yes we will have quite a few homages as we go on and it will be kind of fun.

Really the biggest issue is finding a way to enrich that stable of ships without muddying the waters of like, you know, why have this ship if this ship could do it just as well.Matt Sherman: Yeah, and I mean it's something that we're even seeing just sorta with the Reliant sale because it's our third light hauler ship along with the Aurora CL and the Hull A so making sure that whatever we introduce and offer to you guys distinct and appropriate for both that class of ship and what that role really is and actually entails gameplay-wise.CR: Yeah, everything needs to have a character and we can put in some more flexibility into that and we're looking to do so but that character of our ships is paramount.", "published_at_timestamp": 1433800772, "question": "Will we be able to modify our ships to be more along the lines of the roles introduced by Tracker, Ghost, and Gladiator type ships?", "source": "https://youtu.be/TLE_cqaY1iI", "title": "10 for the Designers: Episode 04 (2015.06.08)", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Sigard Olufson", "time": "4m21s"}, {"objectID": "373682800", "question": "Are there any plans to allow custom coloring to our ships using RGB sliders on various layers / channels of the default ship 'skins'?", "answer": "Daniel Kamensky: So, right now we actually have our 'shears' set up so you can, theoretically, tint stuff with the diffused channel, specular channel, so we can do really big, significant material changes and colour changes, but it's yet to be implemented in programming, and a lot of the older ships that have yet to be updated with physically accurate textures still need to be brought to that system. But once it's all brought into place, you should be able to take like, the M50 for example, and make it black, or you have a Constellation, you want it blue, you should be able to do that. it's still yet to be pushed through design, but I think it's definitely a possibility.Lance Powell: Would you say it's a lot like buying a car? The question's a lot like buying a car, right> This person wants full control of, full RGB control, but as a manufacturer and the artist for the style guide, you'd want to limit the range. Can you talk a little bit about that, plus also the various material types? Gloss vs. Pearl and so on?DK: So, it's a little bit complicated with physically accurate textures, and you do want to keep design consistency throughout your game, like, it'll be a little distracting if someone flew through the Universe with a pink Retaliator that'd be weird, but what we'd probably end up doing is giving you different surfacing types, and different gloss values maybe, different colour values as little swatches you could see. Almost as if you've ever looked at car paint. They have orbs that you can see the surface on before you get your car coated, and you know, you probably will see your ship, and we'll give you a really wide range, so it's not like we're limiting you too too much, but you know, I don't want pink Retaliators in our universe.", "title": "10 for the Artists: Episode 02 (2015.05.18)", "source": "https://youtu.be/shxj7XXKgr4", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Dimachaerus", "time": "22m23s", "published_at_timestamp": 1431986585}, {"objectID": "1f15610159d4c8_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Inflight refueling can be conducted either way; while in motion (like an actual aircraft) will be most difficult!", "published_at_timestamp": 1431295200, "question": "Will the inflight refueling be done while moving or stationary or both?", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/14710-Q-A-MISC-Starfarer-Part-I", "title": "Q&A: MISC Starfarer - Part I", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "373676320", "question": "When playing as a bounty hunter, will we have access to our target's known associates? If so, will we have auto-access to that based on the contract that we accepted, or will we have to buy it?", "answer": "If you're playing a bounty hunter, you'll be taking a mission from somewhere, and typically with the package you'll get some details, perhaps some known associates, so you'd have all these pieces of information, some on you persons of interest list etc, and you'd have to go and track down your bounty using those. Maybe you track down one of those associates, and he gives away a bounty's location. As you go about your job of tracking this person down, you will potentially gain more information about him, sometimes even a new bounty or associate that you'll have to move on to. The system is really fluid, and is build for the fidelity of this world. Even in our early prototyping, the conversation system is looking really cool. I think SC as a space sim is doing it a dis-service, where a First person world makes more sense given all the fidelity. Nothing has done this to our level of fidelity before, transitioning smoothly from certain types of gameplay to others, all simulated in the back-end by the universe simulator, all reactive to actions of you and other players. It'll really feel alive, it's up to you to choose what you want to do in this universe, there really isn't a win-condition or an end-game as you'd normally think in a typical MMO, with a level cap and end-game content. We just have a big huge sandbox you can play in, you might have different definitions of success in the universe, with both non-combat oriented roles as much as combat oriented roles. I can see it all coming together, not as quickly as I'd love, as I really want to play it as much as you guys.

Some missions won't necessarily scale, like some might be really tough so it'd encourage you to get other players or NPCs to help you out, others might be fixed at really small so you do them by yourself as they don't really pay much.

[chuckle]AM: Well...DV: I think a little bit of everything.AM: I think the first thing to understand about any development schedule is it's not written in stone, right? You don't just make a schedule and then it all just works. It moves around, it shifts, it changes every day. So, you know, when it's time to get something out to the players we have to make decisions, and then have to decide what's more important than something else. And we have to say, \"yeah, I know you're working on this thing right now - we need you to stop, and we need you to focus on this. Get that done, and then when you're done with that you can get back to this other thing.\"TD: Yeah, and I guess that goes back to another thing that's kind of, well, nice and unique about us, is we're not shipping a disc. So, just because this person puts this on hold for the final push to a patch, doesn't mean it's never getting done ever, and it's cut from the game forever, will never happen. It just means, \"hey, until three weeks from now, table this, and then we'll come back to it.\"DV: Yeah, we have a backlog of things that people would like to work on, or things that we'd like to see implemented in the game. And on top of that we try to at least gear towards people's specializations anyway. I mean, we're not going to give a UI design to someone who maybe want to program missiles. So we want to make sure the people who are actually working on the project are invested emotionally and mentally in that particular aspect of the game.TD: Yeah. Yeah, you want 'em to be passionate about it. And the other thing... it kind of dovetails nicely with the other question about where and how do design ideas come about, where, you know a lot of people-... We talk about peoples' pet projects generally to me, in this context, would mean like a prototype for something, a design for something, and Calix is I think famous around the office for coming up with all kinds of crazy prototypes - there's illegal racing, and he created that test level, ship graveyard, where he has his own call-sign insignia.AM: I think uhh, didn't Murray Cup come up this way?TD: Yeah. Murray Cup is one of those things that was initially an idea that was bandied about. It was a piece of thing in the lore, and somebody was like, \"ahh, racing would be cool,\"...AM: I thought I recalled- I don't know who did it, but I thought I recalled seeing a very simplified version of race map, that then was kinda the genesis of what Murray Cup became, but originally it was sort of a test piece. Like, \"hey, I built this to sort of test the ships and fly them around,\" and then that sort of evolved into \"hey, we could make that a thing!\"TD: Yeah. I dunno if you've seen Calix's hologram city? It's so fun to fly around, and it makes me want to do a racing map in a city.DV: What this hologram city?TD: It's like, literally it's one of the backdrops for, I think it's ArcCorp, and then you can just fly between all the canyons and valleys of the city skyscrapers.DV: Ohh, I wanna fly through that!TD: It would be incredibly dangerous...DV: Yeah!

I guess you could consider it like your mobiGlas version, other than the fact that you won't be in augmented reality the same way that mobiGlas is in the game.And we have talked about having a second screen support, like you're in a ship potentially, some of the screen stuff can go from the cockpit on to a second screen, but we haven't really done much with that, and that's certainly, I don't think that's going to be a primary thing at the beginning.

I would see that you would, if you do some notable things, you would get an entry in the galactipedia, and the galactipedia could probably talk about what your tree or family has been doing.And you certainly would have some level of that in your own journal, but I'm actually thinking what would probably happen is that you would have your own entry in the galactipedia and it would talk about your family tree and maybe when you become a certain level of fame, that becomes available for everyone to see, but until then, it's just your own personal log of what your family history has been up to.So yes, the idea is to look back and say \"my great, great grandfather did this, my grandfather did that, my father did this, and I've done this.\" That would really be kind of cool.", "title": "10 for the Chairman - Episode 16 .
