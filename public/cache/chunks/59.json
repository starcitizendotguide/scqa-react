It was first established as a commemoration of the successful colonization of Mars (Sol IV). Feasting, fireworks, festivals, and other forms of mass celebration are hallmarks of the holiday, along with the colors gold and green. It is celebrated each year on March 15th throughout the United Empire of Earth (UEE).</p><br/><h1>Origin</h1><br/><p>In the mid-22nd century, the people of Earth (Sol III) established Humanity\u2019s first successful extraplanetary colony on Mars. This was the second attempt at colonization; the first Human colony on Mars failed late in the terraforming process when an error in the atmosphere processors led to sudden mass atmospheric collapse. 4,876 Humans died. The second attempt at a colony was largely regarded as doomed. In a widely-circulated article on the potential dangers a Mars immigrant might face, Kelsey Forset of Sentinel NewsOrg simply wrote, \u201cDon\u2019t tempt fate.\u201d This message was ultimately co-opted: \u201cTempt Fate\u201d with \u201cDon\u2019t\u201d crossed out became an unofficial slogan of the early Mars colonists.</p><br/><p>In 2200, multiple Earth-based governments announced plans for an interplanetary holiday to celebrate 45 successful years of Human habitation on Mars. It would be held during the following Earth-Mars conjunction (18th March 2202) to emphasize the connection between the planets. Martian schoolchildren were invited to submit possible names for the new holiday. \u201cStella Fortuna\u201d was selected from an entry provided by Estelle Priya, age 11, of Port Renatus Public School 17.</p><br/><p>Large public carnivals sponsored by space travel and terraforming companies were held on Mars and Earth. They featured rides, food, games, and half-price tickets to attractions throughout the Sol System, from space stations on the asteroid belt to the volcanoes of Io. New parcels of land on Mars were raffled off to festival attendees, along with a ship outfitted with a quantum engine provided by Roberts Space Industries. Local businesses sold souvenirs stamped with the slogan \u201cWe Tempted Fate: Stella Fortuna 2202.\u201d The day ended with a green and gold firework display.</p><br/><p>Stella Fortuna was held at varying times of the year during Earth-Mars conjunctions for over a half century. In 2257, the majority of governments on Earth and Mars declared March 15th the official holiday. While March 18th was initially proposed, it was not selected due to conflict with another holiday - the anniversary of the first Human born on a planet other than Earth.</p><br/><h1>Celebration and Traditions</h1><br/><p>Stella Fortuna has evolved from a holiday commemorating the early Mars colony to one that celebrates good fortune, boldness, tempting fate, and embarking on new business ventures. This was caused by a number of factors, but the against-all-odds success of the Mars colony combined with the long-term success of early settlers were two major influences. In particular, the families who won land during the first Stella Fortuna did a great deal to promote the idea that the holiday was associated with good luck. By the time the holiday\u2019s final date was selected, people preparing for interplanetary trips were already asking the stars for their blessing. It became a tradition in the late 2200s for explorers to toast the stars before embarking on searches for jump points, or for people launching new business ventures to begin them on March 15th.</p><br/><p>The largest celebrations still occur on Mars. Most businesses close for the holiday and the day after. The festival officially kicks off with a parade featuring elaborately decorated floats in the form of spaceships or stars. Celebrants clad in colorful, light-up costumes throw candy, raffle tickets, or other small prizes from atop the floats into the crowd. Carnivals filled with rides and games run throughout the day and night. Intoxicated crowds will spontaneously burst into traditional songs such as \u201cAim for the Stars but Strike from Mars\u201d and \u201cIlluminate the Way.\u201d Marriage proposals are as common as new business ventures; the green and gold firework display that concludes the festival is a favorite time to seal the deal on business and romantic partnerships alike.", "title": "Galactapedia: Stella Fortuna", "id": "0qn8vv3Aw1", "slug": "stella-fortuna", "template": "Event", "type": "galactapedia", "published_at": "2024-10-25", "published_at_timestamp": 1729823822}, {"objectID": "0jG8nE55zm-ferron-ii", "answer": "Ferron II is a coreless, uninhabited planet in the Ferron system, United Empire of Earth (UEE).

Mark goes on to say that CR (Chris Roberts) is an amazing programmer who has a nice little stream (of code I presume?) where he's changing a lot of the underlying ways of how they attach things, and he has the support of a lot of the Lead Programmers and Engine Tech. So in this stream, he's changing how the Devs attach things to-and-from different things, and one of the problems with the current tech is that, if they want to attach a ship to another ship, a whole slew of problems arise because the ship has an interior physics grid with a bunch of Object Containers, and if you attach it to another one of those, the code doesn't handle it very well and it has problems. So in that stream, he has provided a way to fix those issues, so that a ship could be attached to another ship and it would work as you would expect. If that tech gets past QA and they fix some of the bugs that have resulted from it, it would open up the doors to give them the ability to attach a ship to a ship, so you could dock a ship directly on another ship. For example, on the Constellation there's a fake Merlin atm because they don't have this docking ability yet, but if they get this tech in and working then they could do this properly. The other part of the problem is persistence, where if they do Dock two ships then they have to have some sort of game code understand that they have some sort of ship docked to another, so that when they're streamed-out and streamed back in, the states and connections are established. Then there's the other aspect of gameplay: what does it mean to dock a ship to another ship? Does the interior atmo need to be vented, or do they need to decompress?

I'm talking high power in close range and low powered scatter at long range with potential to maim ship components, clear lesser asteroids, take out EVAers like they're clay pigeons.", "answer": "Alright, so I get it on the not so accurate side, with the not so accurate spread weapon there. I think that's a pretty good idea. I know that, to my knowledge, we don't have a shotgun style weapon for a ship on the schedule in the immediate future. I would say that would be an interesting type of ballistic weapon that you could have for short range stuff. Therefore people trying to EVA you it's sort of like an antipersonnel weapon you could deploy, and kind of a wide hitting component damage on a ship up close would be pretty interesting. It's a good idea, so I think we can put that into the hopper.I will say that as we start to finish up all the components, the implementation, and we move towards the persistent universe where things like ammunition whether it's your ballistic weapon ammunition, or missiles, there will be fuel, all things that will be consumables basically, when you're flying around you're going to have to earn money by getting missions. So if you fire all the rounds from your gatling gun, or you fire your missiles, you're going have to spend some UEC, or Alpha UEC in the pre-final SC-Alpha version of the game, to replenish them.What's really going to happen is we're going... the idea would be that the ballistics and the missiles are actually quite effective, probably more effective than an energy weapon. Of course energy weapons don't have the same ammunition... they don't have a finite amount of ammunition, or a finite amount of shots, you can keep on firing them as long as your power plant is active, and you have enough power, and you're not overheating. What should be the case is that the ballistic weapons, and the missiles, are in fact more effective in the future when we will make this adjustment, once they become sort of perishable as you have finite amounts of ammunition.The gameplay should be you sort of juggle between either your energy weapons, or your ballistic weapons, or your missiles, and you use them depending on situations. So if you want to really do some damage quickly, and not get held up by shields for instance, which is one thing you do get with ballistic weapons is that they sort of penetrate through shields. Then you would use ballistics, the downside of using a ballistic is obviously that you have a finite amount of ammunition and you'll have to go and replenish it when you get into the next space station, or land at the next landing area. We want that kind of juggle between them, it'll be kind of cool.Having some cool different ballistic weapons would also be interesting, like a sort of spread shotgun weapon. I think there will be more weapon management by players in the persistent universe going forward. Especially once we have persistence in, consumables in, things like wear and tear, and all the rest of the stuff that we're going to be starting to roll out over the rest of this year that will allow you to manage your components and equipment better and have different strategies depending on the situation you're in. I think that's going to make for a much more interesting long-term game.What you see right now in Arena Commander, or potentially what you see now in SC-Alpha, in terms of weapon management isn't really what it's going to be once more of the features and persistence is in. Of course, the first stage of persistence will be the next release, and over the subsequent releases we'll flesh it out more and more. I think the gameplay will become quite different, and there will be more variations, and it'll be a bit more interesting.

Currently for our game, I think it's the light marine is stationing a lot of the stuff. A lot of our ships. And the reason why is just the size. The pilots, not the pilots, the light marine is pretty much almost our base male, and so when we design our seats and everything, there's a specific size right, and so a heavy marine will have a lot of gear and he won't fit in those specific, those chairs. And also I was talking with Randy I think a couple of days ago and he was saying that light marine is a certain height, and the heavy marine is literally almost touching the ceiling of the Cutlass I think, or some ship, so there will be limited access to pretty much the size of your armour, so you won't necessarily see a heavy marine driving a Merlin.Will Weissbaum: We have like flight suits distinctly designed for pilots that don't have as much protection and are more flexible, so might be the kind of thing that you have to literally suit up before you plan on heading into battle.JL: Yeah, right...WW: Or carry people who aren't pilots on your ship who are suited up to protect you.JL: They're just cargo.WW: And I think we've talked about like, potentially maybe limiting what you can physically sit down while you're wearing like, if you have a giant gun strapped to your back you might not be able to get into certain seats anyway without taking it off and putting it into storage before you go in, so that kind of role playing elements is pretty neat.JL: So, to answer that question, it's really depends on the size of the character, and depends on the, pretty much if you have giant stuff on, you can't sit on a chair. It's like, yeah.WW: Once we start allowing the mixing and matching of different pieces, it'll see where that kind of breaking point is.JL: Right, that's the scary part is the...

Quantum fuel is a separate resource to the boost/afterburner fuel and obviously the amount of Quantum fuel you have combined with the efficiency of the drive you have which essentially is a modified Quantum Drive and the distance you're going to have to do in the jump through the wormhole will affect how far you can go. The smaller ships that have jump drives probably will not be able to go as far without having to re-fuel or collect some more fuel, bigger ones will be able to carry on going for much further distances. We're expecting a fair amount of gameplay long term for players that want to be flying their Starfarer around and selling fuel to people or there will be refuelling stations and all the rest of the stuff.

But once it's all brought into place, you should be able to take like, the M50 for example, and make it black, or you have a Constellation, you want it blue, you should be able to do that. it's still yet to be pushed through design, but I think it's definitely a possibility.Lance Powell: Would you say it's a lot like buying a car? The question's a lot like buying a car, right> This person wants full control of, full RGB control, but as a manufacturer and the artist for the style guide, you'd want to limit the range. Can you talk a little bit about that, plus also the various material types? Gloss vs. Pearl and so on?DK: So, it's a little bit complicated with physically accurate textures, and you do want to keep design consistency throughout your game, like, it'll be a little distracting if someone flew through the Universe with a pink Retaliator that'd be weird, but what we'd probably end up doing is giving you different surfacing types, and different gloss values maybe, different colour values as little swatches you could see. Almost as if you've ever looked at car paint. They have orbs that you can see the surface on before you get your car coated, and you know, you probably will see your ship, and we'll give you a really wide range, so it's not like we're limiting you too too much, but you know, I don't want pink Retaliators in our universe.", "published_at": "2015-05-18", "title": "10 for the Artists: Episode 02 (2015.05.18)", "source": "https://youtu.be/shxj7XXKgr4", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Dimachaerus", "time": "22m23s", "published_at_timestamp": 1431986585}, {"objectID": "1f15610159d4c8_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Inflight refueling can be conducted either way; while in motion (like an actual aircraft) will be most difficult!", "published_at": "2015-05-11", "published_at_timestamp": 1431295200, "question": "Will the inflight refueling be done while moving or stationary or both?", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/14710-Q-A-MISC-Starfarer-Part-I", "title": "Q&A: MISC Starfarer - Part I", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "373676320", "question": "When playing as a bounty hunter, will we have access to our target's known associates?

Maybe you track down one of those associates, and he gives away a bounty's location. As you go about your job of tracking this person down, you will potentially gain more information about him, sometimes even a new bounty or associate that you'll have to move on to. The system is really fluid, and is build for the fidelity of this world. Even in our early prototyping, the conversation system is looking really cool. I think SC as a space sim is doing it a dis-service, where a First person world makes more sense given all the fidelity. Nothing has done this to our level of fidelity before, transitioning smoothly from certain types of gameplay to others, all simulated in the back-end by the universe simulator, all reactive to actions of you and other players. It'll really feel alive, it's up to you to choose what you want to do in this universe, there really isn't a win-condition or an end-game as you'd normally think in a typical MMO, with a level cap and end-game content.

[chuckle]AM: Well...DV: I think a little bit of everything.AM: I think the first thing to understand about any development schedule is it's not written in stone, right? You don't just make a schedule and then it all just works. It moves around, it shifts, it changes every day. So, you know, when it's time to get something out to the players we have to make decisions, and then have to decide what's more important than something else. And we have to say, \"yeah, I know you're working on this thing right now - we need you to stop, and we need you to focus on this. Get that done, and then when you're done with that you can get back to this other thing.\"TD: Yeah, and I guess that goes back to another thing that's kind of, well, nice and unique about us, is we're not shipping a disc. So, just because this person puts this on hold for the final push to a patch, doesn't mean it's never getting done ever, and it's cut from the game forever, will never happen. It just means, \"hey, until three weeks from now, table this, and then we'll come back to it.\"DV: Yeah, we have a backlog of things that people would like to work on, or things that we'd like to see implemented in the game. And on top of that we try to at least gear towards people's specializations anyway. I mean, we're not going to give a UI design to someone who maybe want to program missiles.

Yeah, you want 'em to be passionate about it. And the other thing... it kind of dovetails nicely with the other question about where and how do design ideas come about, where, you know a lot of people-... We talk about peoples' pet projects generally to me, in this context, would mean like a prototype for something, a design for something, and Calix is I think famous around the office for coming up with all kinds of crazy prototypes - there's illegal racing, and he created that test level, ship graveyard, where he has his own call-sign insignia.AM: I think uhh, didn't Murray Cup come up this way?TD: Yeah. Murray Cup is one of those things that was initially an idea that was bandied about. It was a piece of thing in the lore, and somebody was like, \"ahh, racing would be cool,\"...AM: I thought I recalled- I don't know who did it, but I thought I recalled seeing a very simplified version of race map, that then was kinda the genesis of what Murray Cup became, but originally it was sort of a test piece. Like, \"hey, I built this to sort of test the ships and fly them around,\" and then that sort of evolved into \"hey, we could make that a thing!\"TD: Yeah. I dunno if you've seen Calix's hologram city? It's so fun to fly around, and it makes me want to do a racing map in a city.DV: What this hologram city?TD: It's like, literally it's one of the backdrops for, I think it's ArcCorp, and then you can just fly between all the canyons and valleys of the city skyscrapers.DV: Ohh, I wanna fly through that!TD: It would be incredibly dangerous...DV: Yeah!

I haven't really thought of that in terms of if you're say parents or relative has citizenship, do you get citizen ship too in the case of your character dies and you move on? So I guess I would have to think about that. I would think that we would definitely give, if citizenship does not automatically transfer, which it may not do, we would definitely give you opportunities to regain citizenship so military service would be one of the or various other things you could do, but I don't have a fully formed answer for you on that one, but that's why this process is great. Bring up issues that we need to resolve and it's better to resolve them now than later.", "published_at": "2014-01-17", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 05 (2014.01.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/RtyZzO5OrE0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Funk Trooper", "published_at_timestamp": 1389982600}]
