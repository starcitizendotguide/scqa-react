It was her work exposing a major corruption scheme centered around private firms bidding for public works projects that first drew the attention of the Imperator's office. As High-Secretary, she has advocated for increased funding for infrastructure repair and improvement, worked to close loopholes in Imperial Grant Policy, and helped to oust multiple officials for corruption. She announced her intention to run for Imperator in late 2949 and succeeded in becoming one of five final candidates in the April 2950 Secondary Vote. A member of the Universalist party, her platform included the Jump Start plan to increase infrastructure spending for achievable local projects in an effort to create employment opportunities, freezing and re-evaluating Synthworld funding, and the Active Engagement program to increase civic engagement.

I don't know if we want to talk about the whole entity thing. But conceptually, yeah. We'll definitely be able to have them. Right now they're tied to the biome they're in. But in the future we can be more specific and spawn them on cliff sides. Or where the rocks fall down at the base of a cliff. And then you will find them there and stuff like that. That's definitely possible, I think. <br/><br/> W: I think we want to treat a harvestable like any other asset. If it's a mining rock, we want to spawn it according to parameters that we would spawn a regular rock. We don't care whether it's a here's a game entity that you can mine versus here's a static piece of geo. We want to do them with the same rules.

Luke adds that the stages Elliot just mentioned are in the form of an early payment state, then an escalated payment state, and then after a certain length of time it turns into the felony. The hope is that in 3.7 Players will be able to pay off their fines at the aforementioned kiosks/Fine Terminals, and a little after that Players should be able to be arrested because of their unpaid fine. This might be done by Bounty Hunters, or by Security Forces. If you're in the early payment state, getting scanned by Security Forces could cause them to warn the Player about their unpaid fines, but they won't take action.

[Smirks]BL: Yeah this is like a pre-problem. You're gonna screw this up!DH: I mean It's one of those things... I mean we do the best we can to try and troubleshoot that sort of stuff? Like among the internal reviews and make sure that logic is tracking and people, you know, and again, it's the tricky nature of storytelling in general.  Like those connections between logic points can work for some people and they can't work for other people, so to the people that it doesn't work for it becomes a plot hole, but other people aren't bothered by it. So it's a bit of a mixed bag.I mean I don't know if there's something that's conceivably fixable, just as a hypothetical. I don't know, I think we would have to gauge it based off how glaring the plot hole is. If it's kind of inconsequential, maybe we would just probably ignore it or and then try to address it maybe in the next section or game or whatever.BL: Yeah I'm kind of curious about that. So let's ignore like giant plot holes, but something really really minor like say you say Tanyia has a hair colour or different hair color in two different places, do you go back and fix something that's already published or do you explain it later? What's your preference there.DH: I mean I try to... Personally I dislike retconning especially with what we're doing because we're building it in sort of public view that everyone is getting really involved in this stuff and the last thing we want to do is to basically say like, \"Oh yeah that? Yeah, forget all that\" you know kind of start over and this, they're not made of marshmallows, they're made of sponge cake and people go \"Oh, but I like marshmallows\".BL: Stop spoiling the Kertack.DH: Sorry, sorry!But yeah. I mean if I think it's easy enough, I mean we've found inconsistency within you know Jump Point articles and you know between Jump Point and old news dispatches. So when possible we just go back and we'll just fix them to consolidate and at least be consistent with them. So far we haven't had anything really egregious that's really come back to haunt us. It also in the early days as you remember, we would aim broad.BL: YeahDH:  So it was all just sort of like \"It's kind of this, feeling\" rather than it's specifically blah, blah, blah, A,B,C, and D. So we gave ourselves wiggle room to hone it down later because we knew we would come back to it.BL: We kind of run into a side problem with ships where we want to continue developing new ships that are also old ships and \"Oh wait now we have three years of fiction where we don't mention the Anvil\" or whatever.DH: Yeah.BL: We just had that in a meeting earlier this week, we were talking about a ship we can't name yet and we're like \"Okay this feels like one the military has been using for years\"DH: For a while, but I think to a certain extent I mean because we're, again we're developing it. No one has done that, that's kind of the crazy thing that I keep circling back to. Star Wars came out and now it was Star Wars, there was not you know, the book on the universe of Star Wars and the different races and the different factions and stuff before the movie came out. So this is the first time that we're doing it backwards. I feel like to a certain extent we have to go \"Oh yeah, that ship has been in service for 80 years and we just haven't imagined it because, we didn't know about it\".BL: this is only barely in a side, but just this last weekend I was asking myself, \"What was the Star Wars universe in 1978\"?DH: Oh wow I would be fascinated to know.BL: Well I looked it up, there were three children books, a novelization and it's crazy looking back. One of them is after the movie, Luke Skywalker is a planetary settler and he's at the space academy and it's so different from anything anyone would have thought of.DH: Wow, so there was no plan of or it didn't seem like there were alluding to any kind of set up for Empire Strikes Back, it was just like done!BL: There's even a part where he thinks back to Obi-Wan Kenobi and he's like \"Oh yeah, the force he mentioned something about that\".DH: That's crazy.", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 12", "source": "https://youtu.be/Iydp3X56hpk", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Oberscht", "published_at_timestamp": 1464634147}, {"objectID": "373674230", "question": "Given that procedural planets are generated from a seed, if we go down to a planet and mine a location and it becomes depleted what happens after we leave?

The big brains that are really working on the procedural planet technology are all within Frankfurt. Guys like Marco Corbetta, Carsten Wensel, Sascha Hoba, Pascal M&Atilde;&frac14;ller. They're all working pretty much full time on the procedural planets.We get a lot of oversight on them, we gotta blend them into the game where they're working on the tech. Just consider that when I answer any questions regarding it, is that yeah I'm trying to represent as best as I can.Forrest Stephan: Yeah. We just get to play with it, right?ST: Pretty much.FS: But they're driving all the tech.ST: That's right. They're driving everything that it goes through. To get to the actual question, it's a really good question because, yes, the planets are generated from a seed but consider that our game is multiplayer. We can't generate a different seed for every single player that goes down to the planet. Me and Forrest can't be flying toward a planet. He sees a mountain. I don't see a mountain. I end up flying through it...FS: Right. Yeah.ST: Or whatever. That's going to already be kind of set in stone. So when we generate this planet originally, as a developer, yes we will have a seed. Once you seed as a player, you're always going to see the same thing. Now when it comes down to actually permanently altering the surface of it... what's likely to happen is that when we do mining, it's going to be another object on top of the planet.FS: Right.ST: It's not going to be the planet itself. No, you probably won't alter the actual planet geometry itself, or any of the seeds related to it. You'll alter a different object that's placed on top of the planet. Just to give a really out there example, you've got a big block of ice, right? That big block of ice is sitting there on the planet. You fly down. You're mining water out of the ice, let's say. That ice disappears.Now the question is, will that ice then regenerate? Well it's a design question. It's going to be up to the designers. There's no technical reason why it can't, but likely what's gonna be happening is that we've got an area of ice, right?FS: Right.ST: So it's gonna be a certain number of minerals within a certain, pretty large, area. You're not gonna get the exact same ice block in the exact same position.FS: I think that's where the seed kicks in, right?ST: Sure.FS: You get the initial planet generated, but then the objects on the planet that you're mining and stuff maybe they'll have multiple seeds. So when it regenerates itself, if it regenerates itself, which I don't see why not.ST: Exactly.FS: That would be... random.ST: And that's something that we want to control. It's really important that we control the commodities within our world, so that the economy...FS: Right. Which affects the economics of the whole thing.ST: Exactly. That's kind of a long answer to whether it regenerates or not. I would say no, it doesn't actually regenerate, but it will be somewhere else. The seeds are all shared, so everybody will see the same thing.FS: Exactly.

I would say the few things I get to do, I like playing tennis. That's a sport I played when I was young and I still do it, and it's good for exercise. I don't actually play football, or soccer to everyone in America, anymore. I used to. That was, unfortunately, about 30-40 pounds ago and there may be a correlation between not playing football and getting older. I still watch it a lot. I'm from Manchester, and I've always supported Manchester United. I watch Premiership games over here in America, and when I'm in the UK, I watch them there or actually go to some live games.That, play some games, or try to play some games when I got a little bit of spare time. That's really hard. See some movies, obviously a big movie fan. That's pretty much it. I don't really have much time to do many other things than that. Maybe once Star Citizen is done, then I'll take a lot of time off and get back into some of my hobbies. For instance, I think I've shown off my little miniature Napoleonic figures from when I used to war game.I haven't... Ever since I started doing Wing Commander onwards, I haven't had a chance to do things, like gaming, the same way I used to do a long time ago. It all takes time. I actually used to think when I went to school, \"I can't wait till I'm not going to school, and have all this time to do these other things.\" I look back on it and realize that, when I was actually going to school, I had lots of time for hobbies and now I don't have that much time, but c'est la vie.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 78", "source": "https://youtu.be/ciCNkp20O7w", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Augustus Kron", "published_at_timestamp": 1457391427}, {"objectID": "373680710", "answer": "Darian Vorlick: This is where a lot of the strategic planning and communication between production design comes into play. This is also where good direction from management, Chris or Ben, also comes into play. So when we release a feature or a ship thematically, for example, if we wanted to do a salvage feature, ideally we want to have content for players to take advantage of that.So, a salvage specific ship would be a good example of releasing when we released the salvage mechanics, same thing if we wanted to release a repair mechanic, you know having the what's is it... Endeavor. Having that come out at the same time would make good sense. If we created a mining mechanic using your example here, if we created the mining feature but we don't give players a ship to do mining on. It's a feature that's basically sitting there waiting until we have that feature completed or a ship to take advantage of that feature. Ultimately, this is where planning and preproduction and communication comes into play.Kirk Tome: Right, so none of these things are coincidental. When we do decide to create a ship and decide a release date for it, we need to ensure that the systems that make that are unique to that ship actually exist... are designed out and are implemented from code and tech design so that those systems are in play by the time the ship is actually created.DV: A good example is quantum travel, if we released quantum travel without any ship that can quantum travel...KT: Doesn't make a lot of sense. So, there is a lot of design that goes into that... quantum travel is a great example. We needed to decide what quantum travel was, how it realized itself in the game, how the component interaction for quantum travel was, standard things like the distance for quantum travel, time for quantum travel, quantum fuel is a thing now so we implement quantum fuel as a part of quantum travel. That's a system that needed to be designed before we created a bunch of ships that were capable of doing quantum travel.DV: Excellent question but yes it is not coincidence that we release these like that.", "published_at_timestamp": 1456181823, "question": "How do you coordinate efforts between game play feature implementation and relative ship completion?

While tablets are something that are in the works, we're not far enough along to be able to give a solid answer just yet. So, whether we'd like peripheral devices to have some kind of functionality in game such as if they want it to span four monitors with each particular monitor having a particular command, like one's for a side-cockpit view, the other one's for an aft cockpit view, it entirely depends on what Chris wants, the vision of the game would be for, what he wants in the vision of this game. So, while this is more of a design related question, it's one that we see quite a bit on, will we support this, will we support that, and the answer to that is pretty much, we'd like to, but we have to see exactly how the game evolves over time. So, it's not a yes or no question, it's just, we're going to have to wait and see.LO: And it also has to do with, whenever there's a feature that we want, we always prioritize the more important ones like, to use Gamescom for an example, do you want to avoid this little clipping the corner of your shoe over here, or do you want to make sure the ship explodes? We need to focus on the things that are a priority, and once we're far enough along on those we can present schedules and budgets to Chris, and he can make a more informed decision.DV: Like, if we have, someone has two monitors, we want to make sure that the monitor actually shows the cockpit, and if someone sits down at another computer, they should be able to see the engineering screen, or the weapons screen. We want to make sure all those features are in there first before we start adding on more and more complex features.

[laughs]... is balancing all of those, that's the hardest thing. I don't think any one of those specifically is harder than the other. Each of them take different types of skills, right. So, working alongside people, leading them, helping inspire them to do great work, that takes a lot more soft skills, right. So, it depends on your ability as a producer, I talked about this in Around the 'Verse a week or so ago was there are different kinds of senior producers. Everybody has complimentary, hopefully, skill sets that help each other work together, make a great team. So, some people are really focused on soft skills and just helping unify a team and building that communication hub, that just syncs together. Some are more technical, some love to build schedules, we all kinda have synchronistic skills, I think.TD: I think you and I kinda exemplify that relationship...EKD: Totally.TD: I'm...eh...at scheduling. As far as things go it's not my strongest suit and I think you're really strong at scheduling and you excel on that side. We both, I would say, have pretty good soft skills we're commensurate in that and then your focus is much more heavily on the art and the scheduling and the pipeline side and I think you know that really well. My focus is probably more on the technical and the design side...EKD: Totally.TD: So, I think that's why we're a good team.EKD: Totally, I agree. I don't think one would be harder than the other for each of us, using as examples, I think it just depends on what your core strengths are and then finding the people in your team to help round out those skills so we can all get this thing done. I think Nostromo pointed out some great points, that those are the main things we are looking at as producers. Those are the main core items and trying to come in under budget with a fantastically, greatly working team that communicates awesome, we're hitting as many milestones as we can to get out the best possible experience we can. That's our goal so we have to look at all those different, going back to what you said, pillars of producing. I think balancing is the harder part for sure.TD: Yeah, I think that is the most difficult, it's a juggling act.

Sort of a transaction done, I've talked about a transactional job board system where either party can rate someone, and it'll also be the bartering system board where once you're in there, it'd make sure that a mission can only be accepted if the person posting it actually has the credits to pay it and vice versa so it'll prevent people from saying they'd pay then not actually paying. So you'd say \"This is what I do, pay me and I'll do it\" and the mission board would enforce paying. I imagine if a person reneged on the service they were supposed to provide they would be forced to refund the credits or perhaps be banned from the services board until they are found to be performing the services/some kind of review process.
