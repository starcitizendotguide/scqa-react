Soon after its MXY III.802 (SEY 2483) discovery, the Xi'an government designated it as a testbed for new terraforming and geohacking technologies. These endeavors were abandoned in MXY III.838 (SEY 2530), when Human terraforming company Gaia Planet Services dispatched a survey team to the planet without oversight from the United Planets of Earth (UPE) government. They were taken into custody by the military, where they were held captive until the UPE agreed to reveal the extent of their territory and the locations of all their systems. This was the first encounter between Human and Xi'an, and historians credit tensions arising from this incident as one of the primary causes of the Xi'an-Human Cold War (MXY III.838 - III.1044 / SEY 2530 - 2793).", "id": "bo1wy7GZNr", "question": "Se'kith (Th.us'\u016bng III) ", "slug": "sekith-thusuung-iii", "template": "PlanetMoonSpaceStationPlatform", "title": "Galactapedia: Se'kith (Th.us'\u016bng III) ", "type": "galactapedia"}, {"objectID": "3b2aec2de0ccb_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Turiya Terraforming was a terraforming company most notable for winning the contract from the United Nations of Earth (UNE) to spearhead development of the Oretani system.

In 2485, amidst rumors of food shortages on the space stations and a sense of unrest among the workers at the lack of available land on Oretani II, Bratanek invited reporters to tour operations in Oretani.

It breaks our nice illusion that our planets are full scale, which I hope all of you continue to believe because I certainly do in my heart. The thing about bigger planets is it stretches the complications with precision more, which we're hoping to be able to do away with. But that's one problem. Obviously, we need high resolution textures. At the moment, if we have a global texture and it's, say, 2K, that gives us a certain number of kilometers per pixel. And obviously we have local data, too. But if we make a planet have twice the surface area, then suddenly we have half as much resolution for the same kind of budget. So we need to consider those decisions and consider how the tech can deal with that. But you also get kind of gameplay problems with that as well. If I make a real life size planet, we have fast ships, but like suddenly getting from one place to another takes 10 times as long. And it's not necessarily good for gameplay to have that. So it's a convoluted question. We appreciate the reason that people are asking that we feel the same. But also there's a certain amount of the why question, which I guess you can ask for a lot of our features, which is what we have works. What we have is great. Should we invest more time in making it bigger? Is that a good use of our time versus going and doing rivers, too, or finishing out something else sooner? So if you put up a poll that said roads versus bigger planets, I bet roads would win. So, yeah.<br/><br/> AB: I'd probably add that eight times is probably, like I say, it probably pushes all of them aspects too much. Too low res, it's too much memory, it's too much of a knock on for the gameplay. A smaller increment would be more appealing, I think. You know, like a doubling or something like that. Because just being able to double the scale of our mountains would be nice. Double the scale of our global features, our mountain ranges would be nice. So something 2 or 3x, we know would be more chill. But 8x, pushing a few too many areas at the same time probably for us. Yeah. And then the other thing we talked about, we didn't mention, is content density. We have to fill it with stuff as well. We'll see with Starchitect hopefully helps fill that gap a bit. But we just don't want to, like, if the current game, we don't want to put things miles apart. As we start to see the product of Starchitect, we might be able to see, okay, yeah, things are feeling too crammed and, you know, claustrophobic. Maybe we do need a bit more space and we'll try and explore that.

So any large explosions, like we talked about in Idris rail gun, right? Like, that is a lot of damage as well, and you'll just basically completely remove the harvestables, you know?

Obviously in the early days I worked on Wing Commander with him, Strike Commander, Privateer 2, and then of course at Digital Anvil we did Star Lancer and stuff like that as well.  So, we've got a pretty good working relationship. Obviously we have disagreements about stuff, but at the end of the day I feel we both listen to each other and at the end of the day Chris is the CEO.  So if we have a discussion and he wants to go in a certain direction and I can't convince him, that's the direction we go, but our relationship in that side of things is really good.In terms of what we divulge of Chris is very much out there pushing the direction of the project. He's basically pushing for the stars, he's really trying to make the best game he can out there. He's thinking about ways of doing that, what technologies to bring and how we can make that sort of stuff happen.My job is really just to make sure as all this stuff is getting moved forward and all the ideas are out there.

So right now I think the bigger ships like the Constellation and the Retaliator in combat we haven't fully balanced that and they probably get destroyed and damaged a little too quickly for what they really should be able to do. We need to work, and we are working, on the balancing that, we haven't finished out the damage stuff we haven't implemented the repair stuff fully yet so that will also have some impact, because as you're taking damage if you're going around, managing to sort of patch up and repair things, then you're sort of putting back your damage and keeping your ship active longer. So yes maybe if you don't run around and you're taking lots of damage your ship goes up in two minutes, but if you managing to seal the leaks or shut down a fire in a certain area of corridor or something, then the ship can last for longer or even maybe last through the fight.So that's still an ongoing task as we roll out the repair system and the item system, which will be down the road here. We're quite far along on the item system 2.0 and a bunch of the functionality like the interaction, which is a question here later about, so I'll save that answer for that then. We need to balance the multi-crew ship experience, so it is definitely more enhanced when you and your friends are playing and you have someone's flying, someone's in a turret, and someone's running around putting out fires for instance.

Right now we're working on the actual skin and the way that, like we mentioned earlier, how that reacts to the light, what it actually looks like, what kind of texture we're giving it and all the lore's figured out for the characters, the Vanduul and their different classes.Meanwhile we're also building up all the other species as well. You don't hear about it as much because it's under wraps because we like showing you things in the very near future and stuff like that. We're concentrating on the getting the humans right before we really, we have our, we still have them going on but we're really concentrating our efforts on let's get all the PU characters in, let's get all the clothing and the tech figured out and then we have then once we have that figured out we can start bringing the alien races in.

It's different, obviously once you get into the nuts and bolts of other civilisations and stuff like that, it's always a little tricky. For me it was always the idea that these are still characters and though they maybe Xi'an or Banu or something like that and they come from a different society with different values and stuff like that they're still in a sense characters in a narrative, they still have wants, they have needs, they have things they don't like that and that stuff like that. Some of that might be coloured by the civilisation that they're coming from but it's still just looking at them as characters who are trying to complete a story. It's always been how I look at it.Matt Sherman: Yeah and even also on just some of the gameplay side of that something to keep in mind is as, some of our races could possibly get pretty interesting although right now a lot of them have that humanoid form and lot of that is like, if you imagine an arachnid race the kind of crazy culture that would have to associate with it. A lot of extra moving parts.DH: I remember that's been a popular topic in the ask a dev and stuff like that. You know like having six  foot tall, six legged things. Is that, there was some worry about doing it internally, I don't know what the deal is, is it feasible to do that? Is it much harder cause it's a completely unique set of animation or design or?MS: I need to check with Bender and Riggs on the animation side, but I would definitely say part of it because how an insectoid thing would walk, would move, would act would be much more based on that thing being an insect and not so much being a human, so to have a drastically non-humanoid race it does pose a few extra challenges there.", "published_at_timestamp": 1451344698, "question": "How hard is it to concept and write about alien races as opposed to Humanity?", "source": "https://youtu.be/luDDJoPdMY8", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 01", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Superflytwo", "time": "4m01s"}, {"objectID": "373680010", "question": "What will living spaces be good for?

So that's really a pretty big thing because the living space is like your save point so to speak. So there you go: I think that's actually a pretty big game aspect. And they're kind of cool.And we are going to do some level of very, very, very light roleplaying: so one of the reasons why Star Citizen captures the imagination and you really feel like you are part of the world is we spend the attention and the time to put the little details in there. You're in the ship and it's not just you sitting in the cockpit: you can walk around it an \"oh, here's where I'm going to sleep; here's where I have my meals; here's where I get a cup of coffee; oh, here's where I take a shower; here's where I can go to the toilet\". So it's, not that we want to say \"oh you have to eat every eight hours\" or anything like that but there should be some stuff where you could get a cup of coffee or you could get some food and maybe there's some very small boost or something; there'd be a reason to do that kind of stuff, just to use it, to make you feel like you are part of it. Not to the extent of a DayZ kind of thing but I feel like we want a little bit of light use roleplaying because I think it would be kind of cool. You don't take a shower for a month and then people start to not want to talk to you much: that kind of thing.

One of them is that your Mobi-glass will come with standard really rough translator that can translate stuff in real time for you, but it wouldn't be able to capture all the full nuances of a native speaker.So you would be getting the general idea of what an alien is saying in their language but you wouldn't be able to fully pick up on everything because we want to reward players who take the time, were going through all the effort of making these languages, real languages and speakable so we want to reward players who take the time to actually learn them because that's awesome.You asked if characters would be able to learn languages and kind of, I think the current direction might be that there won't be like a thing you can buy where your character speaks banu, if you want your character to speak banu, you're going to have to learn banu yourself and what you might be able to buy is an NPC who can translate for you or a better translator for your Mobi-glass or something like thats some kind of ingame mechanic but, by making there different layers of interactions with, but yeah if you want to learn that language, you're going to have to learn the language.Adam Wieser: Yeah so if you're a trader who's going to Xi'an territory a lot, it'll definitely benefit you to get a little bit more in detail of that because you might be able to pick up on small handers, small phrasing things that might lead you in a different direction than someone who wanders in there for the first time who(?) will be able to get sale.WW: So orgs start drawing straws on who's going to have to learn those languages.

Also, will landing zones be released in stages like Arc Corp is with the stores and the like coming in later or will the landing zone be fully fleshed out by the time we are able to walk around it?", "answer": "So definitely, there is a pipeline. We don't call them landing zones, we call them the environment pipeline, that's actually lead by Ian Leland in the UK who runs the UK environment team and also supervises the environments that are being built by Behaviour. Great, strong team you've just seen a little bit of their work, they've done a whole bunch of stuff Shuban looks amazing, Nyx looks amazing, a few of the other locations we're working on look amazing. So, it's a pipeline not too dissimilar to ships in terms of some of the modeling, building set ups. We start with concept and then we move our way onto whitebox, then greybox, then we start applying the materials and alpha mapping and textures and stuff like that. As far as the landing zones being released in stages like Arc Corp, what will happen as time goes on and we create, like where we're at the point where we're leaving one zone, going to space, landing on another zone....those zones will come in more full featured. They'll come in with ships, they'll come in with AI running around, doing their stuff. The reason why Arc Corp is pretty bare right now is because some of that functionality is still being worked on so it's not ready for primetime. So, when we need to persistence working properly for us to really sort of have the shops work. So, persistence is us saving your state, your equipment off to the database up in the cloud for your character or your player account. So, what happens right now is when the game starts up it just looks up what you have on your web account, your RSI account, and says, 'oh he's got the Hornet and the Constellation and he's got this item' so it adds it to your account. But it's not particularly persistent, you change what you're wearing or change your load out, that's really not saved back to the database. We save it locally on a local XML file but that's a really short term solution. The real proper solution is changes to your state, changes to your ship, whatever. Whether it's getting old, dirty or broken, they get saved back out to your entry in the player database, the persistent database. That's what we need to have running so it's actually one of our next milestones. That's what we need to have running so you can go buy or sell stuff in the persistent universe. You can go to a shop and buy a weapon and now you'll have that weapon when you come back into the game and you'll be owning that weapon. So, once the shops and all that kind of stuff is working, persistence working, when we launch a new environment, it'll just come in with it's appropriate ships and it's appropriate AI going about their daily schedules. I would say later as the new environments come in they will be much more fully fleshed out. You're just sort of seeing Arc Corp grow and functionality and features come in. It's sort of like our....test kitchen or test bed for some of the PU and social stuff. That's what happening in Arc Corp, same is going to happen in multicrew, so multicrew is like the space version of that and Arc Corp sort of the ground environment version of us testing a whole bunch of stuff. So, Tony's got a whole bunch of plans for really cool AI interactions, some things to do down on the environments that just isn't walking around, emoting or waving at people or glitching through a wall. I think you'll sort of see that the possibilities come around via multicrew and social, then a background will be finishing out these other environments and we'll sort of at some point just turn on some systems for you to explore around and bam it will be kind of there. So, you'll see a lot of the functionality and features come in like I sat multicrew and social and you'll be able to give feedback and sort of kind of see how things come together.

Is it a required change before we see the multi-crew ships in 2.0?", "answer": "It's going quite well. In fact, when everyone gets 1.1, they'll be playing in the engine that is mostly in 64 bit. While players won't really appreciate because it'll still be old maps, and the final element that has not been moved across is the rendering side of stuff (which has to go to camera relative).So the rendering and the 3d pipeline is still gonna be in 32 bit, mainly because the GPUs all run 32 bit, and there's no real point to running 32 bit with rendering, because when you're figuring what's around you that you can see, that's perfectly fine with the 32 bit range. What's not fine is with a huge solar system that you're gonna travel millions of miles across.So we've essentially moved everything aside from the sound module in CryEngine and the rendering pipeline to 64 bit. Now, it will actually be in 1.1, so it's part of our regressive testing.So we're in the middle now of doing the camera relative change, which is where you take the camera and its positions in 64 bit and any of the elements you're rendering in their global 64 bit positions, and then you figure out the relative distance between them, and that turns into a 32 bit number and that goes through the rendering pipeline.So that's where we are in the process, and we're almost done with it &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; so when you guys play 1.1, you'll have most of the code running in 64 bit, for all the positions and matrices and such. But it'll just be dealing with areas and ranges inside our current map range, which are designed to work well with the positions of 32 bit, even though you'll be playing in 64 bit.It is a required change for multicrew ships, mainly because we have large world plus the local grid physics stuff that demoed a little bit when we did Gamescom last year.And we have the Zone System that we're working on, which allows us to do a much better job of efficiently organizing and including and updating entities, objects, render elements, and such in a sparse area structure.Typically, in most FPSes, they use something like an octree, which works really well for something like an FPS level, where there is a pretty constant density of objects which are all pretty high density. Because in an FPS level, you're running around but not actually moving that fast, so there are objects everywhere &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; objects every single meter, so there are thousands or tens of thousands of objects.But in Star Citizen, we have objects of high density, like a spaceship, which can have a lot of moving parts and people on board it, but then have a whole area of space with nothing in it (since space is mostly empty). And then you can get into a spaceship battle where ships are firing laser bolts at each other, and so that battle area will be really dense.So an octree is really inefficient for that difference between a very sparse amount of data and a very dense amount of data. So we've been working on the Zone System, which is being led out of our German office, which is being staffed by a lot of engineers who built CryEngine. So we'll have more to announce down the road, but we've got some legendary people &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; some of the best you can hire &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; working on this.So one of the things we're working on is finishing not only the large world, but the Zone System, which is what will allow us to be a lot more efficient about updating stuff. So it'll make our rendering more efficient, it will allow us to occlude &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; 'okay, here's a big spaceship, I'm outside it, so I don't need to render the interior zone, I don't need to update the interior zone.'So in terms of dealing with bigger space combats with big ships, like an Idris or a Bengal, and then smaller ships like fighters, and then people running around inside the ship and outside, the Zone System is really good at breaking those down into different areas of data density.So that's what we're working on &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; again, with the Zone System, so in terms of flying between areas, you can have Earth and an orbit around Earth, and an orbit around the Moon. And then between them, there's nothing. And as you enter a zone, the System might say, 'Okay, let's stream in the moon, and lets stream in the space station that's around the moon, and let's stream in the asteroids that are hanging out here, and lets stream in the spaceships that are hanging out here.' And also, the space station around the moon could be another Zone inside. And so you'd stream that in, and it comes attached with more Zones inside. So it's really good for updating and rendering and occlusion, and all that stuff.So the Zone System and 64 bit and local grid are all things we really need to have the large ships work efficiently in a place where people can come and go and we can have lots of stuff happen. Because there's a lot of people who are wondering, 'How are you gonna manage to have these big spaceship battles.' And it just requires a different approach on how we're going to update and render and even communicate on the network.Because the Zone System also would be used for figuring out how what level of network updates we'd use, what level of updates we'd use, what you see and don't see. So all these things together, that's all gonna be in multicrew ship combat, and that's the foundational stuff for big space flying around over huge distances, going from planet to planet, and other stuff like that.So that's all in progress, and I think it's gonna be pretty good. We're seeing some really great performance gains in the Zone System way compared to the traditional octree system way.

If I want to load and unload cargo, will I have to do that manually, or can I just have it done while I'm still in my captain's chair?At what point do you declare immersion to be tedious and cut it out?", "answer": "Well that's a good question. I think that we want to balance between all this sort of stuff. So for instance on the missions, your mobiGlas will probably be your primary interface to do what we call a mission brokerage system.It's a little like a Craig's List or so, if you're in the US, I think they have Craig's List in other parts of the world too, which would list various jobs you can take and all the rest of the stuff, and that would be your mobiGlas, and that would be sent out over the spectrum in our universe.But then there will also be some missions that won't be available over that setup. You would potentially have to go to a bar or down a dark alley to get some more dubious or different missions, and that would be a reason to go and visit a bar.We sort of mix it up, so some stuff you have to go visit the place, forcing you to get out and go into a place where maybe you're not so comfortable, and some of the stuff can be done just like it is in the real world, online.That's kind of the approach. Cargo in general, most of it would be loaded and unloaded when you're off doing other stuff, I think in some cases we've been discussing points where maybe you have to oversee or supervise some of the stuff in case there's a PvE encounter.Like a scenario could be you're on a sketchy planet and you're unloading some stuff and a couple people are trying to mug you and you have to fight them off. That's all things that we're playing around with. But again, a fair number of it, you would go back and you would see the cargo going in or out, and things happening without you having to personally load it all up yourself.Although maybe there'll be some places where you're the only person who could load it or unload it. I guess it would depend on the location or the planet Like if you're in space and you're dumping cargo or you're putting cargo in that you've just \"salvaged\" let's say, off a \"wreck,\" then you will have to actually get out of your ship and make sure that it actually gets into your cargo, or you'll have to have a tractor beam that can pull it in to your cargo hold.I hope that answers the question about the balance. We don't want to make it too tedious, but we do want it to feel like you actually have to do some stuff, so we strike a balance between both ways.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 27.

I think there will be no reason why you wouldn't be able to have something on your cargo that could be an explosive device. Part of your cargo could be a bomb that you could remotely detonate.

One of the concepts was higher tier cargo containers could have sort of low-jack identification on it, whereas most of the basic ones don't. If you have one of those, if you gain one of those illicitly, it's much harder for you to sell one of those.So I think we're definitely thinking of things to do that, and then of course there would be the counters for the pirates, because it's always fun to have this back and forth as far as that goes.", "title": "10 for the Chairman - Episode 15 .

Like if it was 8bit you couldn't get over 256 players in an area. It's not going to be built that way at all. It's just the bandwidth throttle and performance throttle, so as those limits go away, we'll probably be able to scale it to hold more people in any particular area.But it's hard to say because with the rate of change in technology, who knows, bandwidth doesn't seem to be quite as fast as everything else.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 11 (2014.03.10)", "source": "https://youtu.be/ItuiYF_lRGc", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Rear Admiral Murray", "published_at_timestamp": 1394491510}, {"objectID": "373686140", "question": "I was wondering when you call for an emergency landing on the carrier, will emergency nets come up to catch the ship to prevent it from causing more damage inside the carrier? If the ship crashes on the flight deck will there be a bulldozer that will push it off the deck and have an emergency crew to put out the fire?", "answer": "I think someone has been watching the Wing Commander movie, which is kind of cool. I don't know about emergency nets, I mean we actually haven't even thought about this it. It will probably be more something that we would have working in Squadron 42 because there would definitely be cases where this sort of thing would be happening there, but I definitely think we'll probably have some level of emergency landings and rescue crew and all the rest of it. So I don't know whether there will necessarily be nets, but we will definitely have that whole sense of bringing in your damaged ship. Hopefully you can bring it down and people will come and beat out the flames and any burning parts of your ship.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 04 (2014.01.10)", "source": "https://youtu.be/FsWDLHVYNHI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Vigilance", "published_at_timestamp": 1389377198}]
