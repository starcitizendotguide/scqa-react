Can you give an idea of how the Star Citizen universe will feel different from other space games?

Each star system will have anywhere from one to six planets, and then there will obviously be moons, space stations, asteroid fields and all the rest of the stuff. You\u2019ll have oceans and forests and mountains, different homesteads and locations, as well as the landing areas. There\u2019s going to be a huge increase in the play area and what people can do, and we\u2019re really going for a kind of frequency of interaction and interest and AI and everything that is much more dense than what you\u2019d typically get in a space game.<br /><br />Normally you\u2019d go to a star system and maybe there would be one or two locations you could land on, you buy or sell stuff, and then you\u2019d go to another location. With Star Citizen just one star system should have enough content and enough things to do for players to play for hundreds, even thousands of hours. The density of experience is going to be much higher than what you\u2019ve seen in other space games, including my own.<br /><br />We actually have a full universe simulation that runs on separate servers, responsible for deciding which planets are trading, which organization is doing what, which factories are doing well, who\u2019s selling what, who needs what kind of goods. It\u2019s populating the universe with the various people going about their jobs, whether it\u2019s a pirate, trader, bounty hunter, law enforcer \u2014 they\u2019re all running around in this universe simulation, and then we use that simulation to drive the content that people interact with when they\u2019re flying around in the universe.<br /><br />The whole concept is to have a living, breathing universe that reacts and responds to the players\u2019 actions. We\u2019re doing things like items, ships or even characters that age, wear and tear. You need to make sure that you\u2019re servicing your spaceship or your equipment, otherwise it\u2019s gets damaged. The idea is that nothing in this world should feel static. It should feel like your actions, and your friends\u2019 actions, have an impact. And the world moves on whether you\u2019re participating or not. I think that makes the game quite different from a lot of the MMOs out there. We obviously haven\u2019t got all this working; it\u2019s all in different stages of development, but that\u2019s the long-term vision \u2014 a dynamic, living, breathing universe where you can just go off and spend as long as you want in it.<br /><br />", "title": "Meet the Man Behind \u2018Star Citizen,\u2019 the Most Ambitious Video Game Ever", "source": "https://gearpatrol.com/2016/10/06/interview-chris-roberts-star-citizen-creator/", "type": "article", "user": "Michael Finn", "published_at_timestamp": 1475712000}, {"objectID": "373686460", "question": "From a DevOps perspective, what is the biggest challenge you face on a day to day basis and does it affect other departments?", "answer": "Mike: You could say everything is a challenge, but they welcome challenges and it\u2019s fun to overcome them.

I mean, there potentially could be things like prisoner transport missions, I mean obviously I\"ve talked about things like trading missions, bounty hunter missions, mercenary missions,  there's information running, so that's the Drake Herald which will be taking data from point A to point B. I'm not sure that the Drake Herald will latch onto a bigger ship, but it certainly will take an information burst and then it can carry it to a destination and broadcast it, or you could hand deliver a data drive, and stuff like that. But there's going to be a whole bunch, I mean the whole idea with the mission system that will run in the persistent universe is that we sort of have this bigger Universe simulation that happens, and that's sort of more a turn-based simulation, but it has 20 million AI and PC's running all around doing their stuff, and there's a whole set of rules of, these economic nodes need these kinds of products, so they request them from other areas and that will generate missions where people will take the goods and if pirates attack them then there'll be more missions for bounty hunters to go after the pirates and mercenaries to protect the convoys, and all those missions become available for AI or players.So players can take 'em or AI can take them if players don't take them, and then depending on the outcome of the missions, that either is simulated on the Universe side, if there's no players involved, which is more sort of high-end turn-based simulation, or, if players did get involved, or come across these missions, they get simulated on a high-fidelity basis, which is sort of the gameplay, running around, flying the ship, doing the actions, and the results of those get fed back into the universe simulation so if you kill some pirates, it gets told back to the Universe simulator, which says okay, these two pirates were killed in this system, so now there'll be two less pirates in that system, so you could have a whole bunch of bounty hunters, clean out the pirates in the system, and then all of a sudden there won't be pirates on the universe simulator in that system, so there won't be so much piracy, so there won't be so many missions then for mercenaries to do escorting, but of course, some pirates in another system may hear that there's no no pirates there, no competition, so they may move into it, so all of that happens, the universe system sort of runs this echo system that has a feedback loop from the game, and the game itself basically scrapes the state of the universe system periodically.We haven't quite determined whether it's every 30 minutes or every 5 minutes, but it sort of time-slices across all the systems and says, okay, who's in this system right now, what AI do we have, what are they doing, what locations they are, and then it uses that to sort of generate the local situations that you experience when you're flying around yourself. So it's kind of like the universe system is a dynamic mission generator for the game experience. You have, and so it's got a really cool feedback loop, it's going to feel really alive, even if there's only you in the game, there's still going to be loads of AI moving around. I've already said that I've got almost a 90% AI and PC's to 10% player base, even if we've got millions of players, so what that means is no matter what, the Universe will b e alive, things will be happening, there'll be reactions to what you do, and it can be with you and your friends, you can come across other players, so I think it will be a really really cool experience, and there will be lots of missions, so... not just the ones I've mentioned, or that was asked questions about.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 69", "source": "https://youtu.be/AiTY_K7bDys", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Jmojo", "published_at_timestamp": 1447110918}, {"objectID": "373681140", "question": "Are there any plans to have any type of supported add on's in the game, in regards to UI customization or data collection?

So, longer term, yes.   We've said we want to do that, so those are things that would definitely be on the list.  They would not be obviously the first up, because let's get the game finished and get it done, and let everyone adventure around it, but long term we would.  This is not going to be a short term project, I mean, it hasn't really been for you guys, because you've backed it and stayed with it.  It's obviously taking longer, but it's going to be much bigger and I think, much better than everyone was originally thinking it was going to be because it's got a level of detail that's just going to be amazing.  But, it is something we're going to commit to longer term and these are the sorts of features that once the base version is up and running, we'll start to add on this extra stuff.  The more stuff that people can connect into it, the more that they'll be able to add their own, user generated content, and all that stuff.  So that is something that we'd put on our long term roadmap, and have in fact some of it we've already announced that we would have an app that would hook into say, your mobiGlas, and you could check on like an account, or arrange for a meetup with people, or transfer stuff around in system on an app, and we've definitely talked about secondary screen stuff.  We'll probably also do secondary screen stuff also for the high end Saitek HOTAS that we're developing with them, so yes.  Long term, we definitely want to create some level of API for you guys, because I think it would add to &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; it's amazing what you guys have managed to do without us providing any of that, so imagine what if we did provide you something like that.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 66", "source": "https://youtu.be/VGTj2iWkS-8", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Ghostwolf", "published_at_timestamp": 1442269621}, {"objectID": "8bc76e78f664d_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The AR cockpit is a more complex interface, more akin to the tactical stations found on Star Citizen's capital ships.

Will AI on my ship or planet-side come up to me and start a conversation or tell me something important or will players need to approach every AI that they in order to ask a question or interact with?", "answer": "Well, our goal with the AI, and this is what you'll see in SQ42 is to make them active in a lot of ways, so you won't need to go up to them specifically, they'll come to you if its relevant and they need to talk, so they will engage you and ask you do things for them, or tell you something. This is going to be true across the parts of the game, the AI in SQ42 and the AI in the PU are going to be sharing pretty much most of the same systems. The idea is if you have ship crewmates running around they'll have their own personalities, so they might be making themselves a cup of coffee if there's not a task for them to be doing, or chilling out in the bunk, or might come up to you every now and again to say a line or two, maybe crack a bad joke or something. They'll be context aware as well, if you're going on a particular quest, maybe they'll seek you out when you're on a planet with information related to things. We're trying to distance ourselves from the static conversation tree, where you know where a character is all of the time and you have set communication options with them to navigate. We're really trying to make our AI REALLY dynamic, and SQ42 will be the first test of that. In that we're trying to make a living environment, so when you're aboard a ship there are particular crew going about their daily life, and they might come and talk to you or you can chat to them etc. We're really shooting for a level above anything else, or at least anything else I've ever done.

Does it become salvageable? Does it pop back into your hangar?", "answer": "Well I'd say if you're out in the verse and die while EVA-ing, your ship would stay in that instance and for anyone in that instance they could take it/salvage it/do something to it. Then, when you \"respawn\" on a planet (having been rescued) your ship would be an insurance claim to get one back. The ship WOULD persist though, so if a friend was nearby and could salvage the ship or fly it back for you there would be a benefit to that, say maybe not losing a life, or not affecting your future premiums or something insurance related. There will be a game mechanic to encourage your friends or people that are doing rescue or salvage role to get involved and help out. The exact implementation hasn't been fully worked out, don't take my insurance premiums comment seriously, that's just an example of a benefit/consequence. But if there was no salvage or friends out there you'd have to file an insurance claim, which will replace the base ship, not your extra gear or cargo.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 42 (2014.10.20)", "source": "https://youtu.be/paE5gpEdltI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Drum", "published_at_timestamp": 1413842404}, {"objectID": "373679170", "question": "A large problem in traditional persistent online universe mechanics, is the over proliferation of old items versus new items. This leads to power escalation in new items. To provide relevant upgrade paths and progression without constant power escalation, will we see items deteriorate over time and eventually NEED replacement completely?", "answer": "Yes is the answer to that! So we're building in, from the beginning, all ships and all items sort of have wear and tear, and over time they will take wear and tear, and you will have to maintain them and fix them up. Some items will just sort of degrade and then eventually you'll have to replace them. Ships you can, as long as you keep the maintenance up, you'll probably be able to fly them for a long time. That's not to say that a manufacturer may not release a newer, better model. But essentially we're building in the idea of wear and tear to all the items to add realism. Like, we want you to go down to a landing area, and if this is sort of an old beaten up mining colony, you see it versus a brand new one that just was erected a year ago. And we've actually built into our ships, and items, and environments what we call \"layer blending\" on all the materials and textures. So literally, I could show you in the engine, I can move a slider and you can see something looking pretty into going really beaten up and nicked, and it's pretty cool! So that's a standard thing we're building into the game itself, and I think you should be able to see if someone's got a well-worn ship or it's a brand new ship. Those will all be the fun little visual, subtle cues that will, A) make the game feel a lot more alive, and also give a good idea of who you're coming up against.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 34 (2014.08.18)", "source": "https://youtu.be/y4wAP1fWe8c", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "PhadeOut", "published_at_timestamp": 1408399954}, {"objectID": "373684840", "question": "On the topic of procedural generation planet side, when and if this technology comes to fruition post release, what can we expect to see included with it besides exploration and atmospheric flight?Will we see some new procedurally generated planets in addition to the ones already in the verse that are just barren?Is it also possible that this procedural generation will extend into jump points as well and actually facilitate the creation of new planets and areas?", "answer": "Yeah, we're doing the R&D right now, so actually the first thing that we're doing with procedural generation is researching asteroid generation, asteroid field generation, the ability to mine asteroids using voxel technology, so finding the seams of minerals inside asteroids.Then the planets to extend it to system generation so we can generate different styles of systems using the procedural tech.Then move on to celestial bodies like planets in terms of the generation of them from the exterior.And then the later stages will be procedural work for the environments you land in. We would have certain areas that we would design, and then just flesh out the background city or the background landscape beyond the area that you can explore.And very, very, very long term, if we can figure out a way to make the planet actually interesting, we would be interested in trying to make a planet that you can actually go fly around over the surface. But that's actually the pipe dream at the moment, because even with procedural generation, you have to do a lot of other things like build cities and what's happening on the planet, and having all that simulated. We're already trying to do a whole universe and have an economy and all that work, so I wouldn't promise anything on that yet.But we certainly are doing research into seeing, could we extend the areas down on the planet, can you fly down onto a planet and fly around it? And if we can do all that, that would be great.I know that there are a couple of demos and games out there that are promising it, but it's one thing to show it as a general concept and it's empty, and another one to actually have it be interesting and feel like it's a proper living breathing, realistic planet.So anyway, that's the update on the procedural generation side, I think it will really help us flesh out the galaxy and the systems and the locations that you can visit and a lot of the other stuff.", "title": "10 for the Chairman - Episode 16 .

Essentially it has a much bigger and more powerful radar array, and should be able to pump information to another ship and can receive it. So someone in a tracker, the idea would be they're sort of Command and Control for an air group, and there will definitely be big capital ships that have even bigger command and control. You could have a Hornet tracker relay its information to a bigger ship as eyes and ears further out, or possibly in an asteroid field where the visibility isn't very good. We're actually having a lot of fun on the capital ship building design. I think you guys are gonna be pretty blown away when we go into that in detail. Which we will do in the near future.
