The only, the only way you can bring something. So the first, the first fundamental point you have to understand is every single item can only exist once, right? So you can't have a copy of the same exact instance of an item in multiple charts. If you have your ship and you bring it to chart A, it is in chart A. That ship can't exist in a different chart. And there's a good reason for it. If it would exist in multiple charts, what happened if in one chart, someone shoots the left wing off in the other shot, someone shoots the right wing off, right? We can't, we can't allow that to happen. So what that means is if that ship is in a chart, it's locked to the chart. It is just part of that instance. If you take that ship and pay, bring it into your global inventory, that's then your way to take this ship and bring it with you to a different chart. And every, every, every shot in this very first iteration is its own isolated instance, basically.<br/><br/>Jared: And then drawing that line forward to server meshing, server meshing isn't about replication either. Server meshing is about bringing all of these things to all of these servers together in a mesh. And it moves, it transitions, it doesn't replicate.<br/><br/>Paul: If we talk about replication, I mean, obviously if I talk about replication, I probably have a different thing in my head because in server meshing, we do replicate objects between different servers because multiple servers will eventually simulate the same chart. And obviously in that case, you might have two servers and they replicate the same object between each other for simulation reasons, right? So we don't be like, it could be that server A simulates one area and server B simulates another area. There's overlap. In that overlap, you have objects in that overlap area replicated to both servers, right? That's why for me, replication is a bit different word, but you can see a shot again, as it's unique individual instance. There's no cross-shot replication plan. We do, once we talk about player basis and so on, we do have discussions with design right now, how we can do that for like, if a player builds a base on a planet, for example, we kind of want to show that on all charts, not just on the one shot the player's in, but those discussions are still happening.", "source": "https://youtu.be/jXvIO8vJkgI", "published_at": "2022-09-16", "title": "Star Citizen Live: Persistent Entity Streaming", "type": "youtube", "published_at_timestamp": 1663350921}, {"objectID": "1a6ccb2040e909_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "As always, blades will be able to slave remote turrets to pilots.

Are they just labels?", "answer": "Chris Roberts: I feel like they're just labels - people still think of the old way [of making games], like my past games. We'd talk about a game for years, we'd show it, but no one would have their hands on it 'til it was out. There was an obsession with 'when will it get released'. Even with those [traditional boxed] games now, they get patched, they add things, make things better over time. The way I look at it is, if you've supported Star Citizen you can download and play 2.63 which is a mini, early-stage version of this universe and play around. There's a game experience there - it's not got nearly as much as we'll have in the final game but you can go and see how ships feel, find out what you think, and get your voice heard in our community as we make it better. It's like saying 'hey, we're going to have this really fancy hotel, but if you want to stay in this wing which is finished but maybe all the bits aren't quite working - there's no hot water yet - you can'.<br /><br />You're getting in there at a much cheaper rate than when it's finished and you can maybe help us define how we operate. I think even if we said, this is now past beta, the paradigm for online stuff just doesn't work that way now. You see it all the time. League of Legends continues to add new heroes, even more traditional stuff like World of Warcraft has revisions every year. Even if we said, 'we're released', we're never going to stop adding content. That's how online games die. If you look at EVE Online now, it looks nothing like the game which launched. GTA Online, too, it originally launched on PS3 and Xbox 360 which aren't even supported now, they're constantly adding new stuff to it. Maybe people need to shift their point of view - the way I look at it on Star Citizen, if you get involved it's not going to be completely polished or finished but you'll get your voice heard.

Can you talk through the changes to the ship pipeline over the last year and how it's reduced the time it takes to get a ship from concept to flight? Also, do you think there is room for improvement (maybe we can get the Carrack sooner)?", "answer": "Patrick Salerno: Yeah. Definitely. I think you might actually be a bit better answering this question per se but from what I've seen from the ship pipeline as a whole, from Concept to Tech Design to Implementation, we've definitely made progress. Because we're working more closely with our other studios, we do a lot of the tech and the design and help with the engineering. And it's all just coming together and you're seeing things, higher quality, more complicated assets, coming out quicker. Right? Versus concepting it, building the tech, putting the tech into practice, experimenting on it, breaking it, fixing it, and rebuilding it. Right? The pipeline's come together which means assets are getting pushed out faster.Elwin Bachiller: Yeah. Absolutely. To speak specifically about what some of the changes ... what some of the changes have been to the pipeline specifically in developing the ships. We've moved slightly away from a paradigm where we had concept fully developed for a ship before production started going in to work for it.So now what we're doing is we're spending a lot of time upfront working with Game Design to make sure that all of the mechanics that the ship needs to comply with, or the space that's required for the player to walk around in if it has an interior area, is all blocked out ahead of time, and before we even give that to the concept artist, to make sure that when a concept artist does his work it all fits with the game rules and we don't have to worry about having to too drastically changing the concept that's already been developed.Changes will always happen but doing it this way allows us to catch any problems really early on before anybody spends weeks or months of their lives developing an assets that then has to be reworked in the future.So for the Carrack specifically we have plans to build that \"soonish\". That's the best I can say about that. But right now Anvil is one of the those manufacturers that still needs to have its library filled out. So Aegis, for example, because of the Retaliator and some of the other ships in their line, they have quite a bit of content to draw from to develop the newer ships a bit faster. With Anvil we're not quite at that point yet and so when we get there we will be able to hit our stride and be able to develop ships faster. What will most likely happen is the Carrack will probably help develop that library for us because it will be the first large, multi-crew Anvil ship that we probably work on. And so that's how we'll develop our assets to then, in the future, be able to build ships even quicker.", "published_at": "2016-03-21", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 07", "source": "https://youtu.be/9otSsylG3OI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Cavguy", "published_at_timestamp": 1458597254}, {"objectID": "373675670", "question": "Will larger ships have damage control lockers? Places where emergency response and repair parts are stored. To respond to shipboard fires, hull breaches, dangerous gases, etc.", "answer": "Yes. So absolutely we're going to have specific gameplay on bigger ships where there will be, nodes and things that will break down so pipes are connected and the pipes are why it has power or heat or oxygen in the case of life support, would all be connected so the different items they may require power but they also emit heat or they may require a data input. On the bigger ships, those pipes go through different connectors or conduits.You could almost think of it as a conduit that has a fuse in and maybe when there's damage boom the fuse blows. So there's a power surge and the fuse blows. So now this connector, the power goes here but it doesn't go through here 'cause the fuse needs replacing. So part of the gameplay will be like  \"Ok right. Crap the back turret's down because the power nodes gone down on the left side of the hull will you go and fix it?\" And you run back, take out the, open up the connector, take out the broken fuse, put the new fuse in. Power gets restored to the turret at the back. So there will be definitely that kind of gameplay, fires could break out you have to go and extinguish them with a fire extinguisher.So we're going to add gameplay in the bigger ships to give you things to do. There will be really cool multi crew stuff. The classic going back to the engine and it's going to overheat  and the Scotty moment and he's got to go and fix it. So I think that will make the multi crew more compelling we're also working on better improvements for how the turrets operate and all that kind of stuff. So watch the gameplay experience to improve over the next X number of patches and that's a big focus for us. I think it's one of the coolest things you can do that in Star Citizen you don't really get to do that in, well pretty much any other game and even with the limited multi crew action you can do now I see loads of cool videos. People running back in the turret and fighting off some pirates that attack them or other players that are attacking them while their friends flying so just imagine that when you're actually able to fix things or patch things up and you can do more from the Engineering Stations.With the future iterations where we have our new item system comes online properly which has a lot more power and has the ability to share authority between items so we really can have a pilot designates some functions to a co-pilot in a way that you can't presently do but it is part of the plan and it's part of our new item system which is the first iteration comes online for some of the personal items in 2.3 and then beyond that. So I think there's going to be some pretty cool gameplay with that.", "published_at": "2016-01-25", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 75", "source": "https://youtu.be/GGreb21dKdg", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Sidhe Drac Macgillean", "published_at_timestamp": 1453762281}, {"objectID": "373682960", "answer": "Eric Kieron Davis: This is a question I added for you. The new damage tech. This is obviously a big item because it was.. Much like the ship's evolution damage has evolved as well right? Our expectations for it, our ability to do it, our tech behind it has all evolved.Forrest Stephan: Yeah and I think we can take a step back and that is why upgrade the damage tech right? Again it's a balance of time, functionality and quality. Your basic project management steps that actually define that triangle. So one thing that we found very early with the damage stuff it was very labour intensive and the results were very expensive in game.So that was a big challenge and we have amazing graphics programmers like Allie and Oaken and other people that just can create tech that is more shader driven, that limits the amount of manual labour that Artists need to do. So they can concentrate on making them look good while the system drives them and we have consistent frame rates because it is so code driven by the people that are controlling the frame rates and that are requesting what the frame rates are for us to deliver quality wise.So the damage tech required us to: write a new shader that allowed you to, as we've probably all seen, penetrate the ship so you kind of exposing the inside which I've learned are called: gubbins.EKD: Gubbins. The gubbins.FS: The gubbins is exposing the inside. Instead of building a ridiculous amount of debris pieces that come off we worked concept right on working an inner frame rate. Framework of the ship so when it exposes it, you can see what the inside of the ship looks like before it penetrates all the way through into the actual interior.Which is kind of neat and it allows us to build kits that are these frames. So as we build new ships and we put this gubbins inside the other ships, we have a gubbins library that we can pull from. So we don't build a custom frame for every ship, we build these pieces and then we re-use them constantly. So the previous system required every aspect of the ship to be custom damage modelled. Now it's shader driven so it renders through the mesh and then we have geo inside of it that's reusable constantly. That's fantastic.EKD: It's great. So it's incredible hard! No I mean it's hard to implement it but it's so very technical.

You mentioned putting griefers into instances together, but what behaviour would flag you for that, and would that behaviour eventually get you banned?", "answer": "Well I mean it's kind of hard to say. The typical griefing is what you don't want to have happen is spending their whole time harassing the new players that don't quite understand how to play yet or the system and taking advantage of them. So like for instance if someone was hanging right on the edge of the Green Zone and when a new player flies out say of Crusader and they blast them to bits and they keep doing that, that would be kind of griefing. If someone deliberately starts crashing their ships into other people when they're on the landing pad in the Green Zone in Crusader that would be kind of griefing. In the bigger game in the final game we're going to set up this whole idea of bounties and when you've been doing anti-social behaviour in certain areas so like UEE controlled space if you just attack someone especially if you continue to do it, it's likely your ID code is going to get broadcast and then at that point you, there's a bounty on your head and not only will NPC's but now there is authorised PvP on you. So what will happen is if you engage that you'll be fighting NPC's and other players that will not have a penalty for now going after you.So we're hoping a few system like that will help with making the whole system not encourage people to troll beginning players we're still going to work on that, it's obviously stuff we got idea's we're going to put in or we're going to try to I guess adjust depending on what's happening and just go from there. As far as behaviour getting banned if we note someone that continually grief then that would probably be something that would be part of their player record and then part of the match making could be potentially \"well let's just put people that grief in the same instance with each other so they can just grief each other\" and I think there's other elements we can do in that case to not encourage the behaviour let me put it that way. We definitely want people to be pirates we do not want to prevent PvP in the places where PvP can or should happen, but we don't want people just harassing other people to hurt their game experience for the lols so to speak and that's always difficult cause this happens in every MMO so we're going to try out best and not sure that we necessarily always got the right solutions but we've got some ideas that I think are pretty good and we'll go from there.", "published_at": "2015-12-21", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 73", "source": "https://youtu.be/MHLwAuM1J8c", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Otleaz", "published_at_timestamp": 1450739049}, {"objectID": "373680070", "question": "How are the plans on the locking/keys etc. On our ships?

We're basically going to have a higher degree of security than we currently have on the ships. One of our thoughts was with SC Alpha 2.0 is, various, the, locking systems and how we're going to do it, we sort of figure that the very first iteration that we get out there, we're just making it more open and see what people do and then we'll obviously adjust some things, so things will be more reasonable. People can't steal your ships, people can't refuel as easily in areas that you should not be getting griefed in. Those are all features and functionality that we didn't really want to wait to program a complete nanny state and put it out there and then not have to do all that work so it's kind of better to get it out there and see what happens, but the idea is yes your ship should be keyed to you and you could enter it and then you could allow other people to enter. Then ultimately there will be some forms that people can break in or board like out in space for instance if you left your ship there someone may be able to EVA in and break the lock or blow the seal and get in, but it will definitely have more security than it currently does now.

You know... and it's just, it's extrapolate-... it's a lot more stuff that you'd have to build in order to make it believable in the universe, rather than...Will Weissbaum: And, hearing you talk I'm wondering now if the question - because of \"relations\" - if you're asking by \"hybrid colony\", like, Xi'An and humans building a city together.DH: Oh, in that regard, yeah! I mean, I think there would-... you know, or even just are there interpersonal relationships regardless of producing offspring? I would think, sure. Yeah.WW: Yeah, I think there will be mixed crews. I mean, Tevarin - we're hoping to have a fully integrated-... even though there's some political and social issues going on with the Tevarin people, they are part of the UEE. And then we're also talking about having ports where there's a lot of inter-species trade going on. So you'll have Banu, and Xi'An, and humans all living side by side in one city, and kind of seeing how that melting pot will develop will be real interesting for us to explore and develop. But basically, yeah, you're going to be able to get your Banu best friend!DH: B...B...F?WW: BBBFF...", "published_at": "2015-01-05", "title": "10 for the Writers: Episode 02 (2015.01.05)", "source": "https://youtu.be/kVBQxqKnakI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Star-Lord", "published_at_timestamp": 1420498846}, {"objectID": "373683400", "question": "Will we get to select our home planets in the PU?

And certainly you can see it effected the combat ability of the various people who were showing it off.So good job out there to the community for demoing that, but yeah, we thought it was super cool, so yeah, we're investigating it.", "published_at": "2014-06-23", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 26.

I think we've stated before that we're going to put a cap on that. Whether it's a daily or a monthly cap, it will be a certain fixed amount that you'll be able to put into the system, and that's really to allow a couple things.One, once the game's out, since we're not charging a subscription, we need to figure out some way to bring some revenue in so we can keep the servers up and we can also be adding content as we go on. Because our plan is to continually add more and more features and more and more content. You know, it's space, so it's infinite so we can keep on building it out and making it a lot more going on there. We really want to make it reactive to what the players are doing, which will require quite a lot of game master staff and people dedicated to building content that riffs off what the players are doing in the universe.You need money to do that, so we are, our revenue plan if you want to call it that, is new players are coming in and buying their initial package or existing players who maybe don't have 20 hours a week to be flying around and adventuring and making money, but just a few hours on the weekend and they really like that cool ship so they just want to fly it and they don't mind spending a little money to buy the UEC. The philosophy of the game is that there is nothing in the game that you can only buy with money. You can earn everything playing the game, but you can also purchase some credits and shortcut having to spend the time running missions to earn some money.By the way, running mission is the fun part of the game, so that's not a grind like it would be on most of the games that would have this kind of thing. That's the core, that's the core of what Privateer was, that's the core of what Freelancer was, but we do recognize that there's people like myself who are now older and I don't have all the time in the world, so sometimes I don't mind paying a little bit for convenience I guess would be the way to say it. Those are the two ways that we think we'll be able to generate enough revenue to keep the servers on, and content flowing back into it.But, as to the question of whether it's going to unbalance the game, because we're limiting it, and because there's also a whole bunch of real world simulation or dynamics to the universe, for instance there's a cost to doing business, there's landing tariffs, there's sales taxes, your equipment has wear and tear over time, you can see it get older and then you've got to maintain it, and you've got to fix it up occasionally. All these things take money to have happen, so essentially they will balance out, even with people bringing new money into the system, these things will take a little bit of money out, and then of course the other big concept is that the player base in this universe is only a small portion of what we're really simulating. We're estimating that the player base will be no more than 10% of the economy we're simulating and the number of AI or NPCs that are running around on a big meta basis.So at that point you don't have a large group of people who... If someone comes in and everyone decides to buy some UEC, which they're not going to do, they still wouldn't be able to bring enough in to effectively unbalance the economy based on the other credit sinks that are happening in the economy and the ratio of real players to NPC players, and the fact that we also limit the stuff.That's what our plan is, I mean obviously we're not at that point yet, so it could have some flaws, but we think that it's a pretty good approach to take at the moment.", "published_at": "2014-05-26", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 22.

If you manage to do that, you have a chance of saving the life of that player.In terms of the number of lives you go through, every character will have a finite life. The idea is like a cat. You've got so many lives before you properly die and then you have to move on to a new character in the universe, which was all described in my Death of a Spaceman post a while ago.But what we were thinking is that it would be a nice gameplay element that would encourage people to try and recover either the wounded or incapacitated bodies of friends to get them back.Maybe in a boarding action you'll fail, so you'll lick your wounds, grab your fallen comrades, get them back on your ship, and then high-tail off somewhere to try and heal them, maybe go to some shady pirate doctor so you can get fixed and not lose your life.That's what the solution is, if you abandon your friend there, I think what we'd probably do is you lose a life, and at some point we detatch the body that would be sitting on your ship, which we'd probably allow you to vent or put out of your ship, but that wouldn't preclude, if the person actually lost their life, being able to respawn on a planet. They just at that point separate in terms of characters, we probably don't want a body just magically disappearing on board a ship. Anyway, that's kind of our plan thinking on that.", "published_at": "2014-04-28", "title": "10 for the Chairman Episode 18.

But maybe that could be down the road. We're still working it out.We've actually got a pretty cool mining mechanic.We're gonna do voxelization of asteroids, and there's a whole sort of... It won't be just holding a space bar for two hour and you've now mined something. There will be a lot of logistics involved in terms of getting the minerals, then taking it to someone to get refined, and all the rest of the stuff.All along the mining and logistics chain, people will get involved. So I think it will be a cool game for people who like to do that, and that's the idea with Star Citizen, to have all these different things you can do with it.
