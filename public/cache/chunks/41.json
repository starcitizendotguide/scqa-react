", "answer": "So many things. I'll take this opportunity to do a sort of mini postmortem.<br/><b>Insufficient Medical Supplies:</b><br/>There aren't enough medical supplies available for haulers to participate freely in the event. For Ninetails Lockdown, some of you who participated in the very first Evocati test might actually remember there were shop mods that made it so the shops selling medical supplies had their sell inventories boosted, much like the station has its buy inventory capacity boosted. We decided to remove those mods to emphasize the derelicts due to XenoThreat feedback. Thanks to the Ninetails feedback that has come in, I was able to rehash that conversation and I have hooked the shop mods for sell locations back up for 3.15. We're a bit worried this will be too profitable, but an enjoyable experience is worth a little temporary economic destabilization, and this is something that can be tuned. Longer-term, improvements to the shop system should also help this.<br/><br/><b>Players not playing the Nine Tail's side:</b><br/>This is the most painful one for me. Based on our analytics, for every 1 Nine Tails-aligned player there were 20 Crusader-aligned players. Short term, I'm looking to increase the rewards for the Nine Tails, but if I'm being honest, I expect this to have very little impact. Longer-term, I've requested some tech to deal with Nine Tails-aligned players being sent to jail, and once players can obtain Nine Tails reputation, my hope is that I can move away from using CrimeStats as a determiner for participation, and thus have players be a bit more long-term in what sides they want to align with.<br/><br/><b>Event was too short:</b><br/>Many players were unable to participate in the event due to it ending before they could log in. Mea culpa on this one. I had set the prologue phase to one hour, thinking that would be sufficient. This number is dynamically tunable whenever we launch the event, so we will probably extend the prologue a bit in the future. I also have asked that, in the future, at least until we have a large enough stable of these events to allow players to regularly log in and find something available, we give a bit more outside-the-game warning for Nine Tails, so people can plan to log in.<br/><br/><b>Event was too long/repetitive:</b><br/>As other systems come into place throughout the game, my hope is that this will naturally evolve a bit. For instance, one of my least favorite pieces of the event right now is that I send out AI scanner ships for players to defend. I would vastly prefer that I offer this job to players as well, once long-distance scanning becomes more of thing.<br/><br/><b>Doesn't Feel like a blockade:</b><br/>While flying in, you are not attacked nearly enough by Nine Tails AI. This was one we saw coming, but its not fixable in the short-term. It's actually a performance problem combined with a few AI problems. The ships are taking a long time to spawn (so you've already flown by), they spawn standing still, and they cannot currently fly fast enough to catch up to you/don't have a way to stop you.

So this team just got created, and the main designer on it was focusing on the Vanguard before and building that, and then from there he's moving over to the tuning and polishing of these things. From his standpoint he would be building something, and then would be able to fit tuning in for about 3-4 weeks to do as many changes as possible, and then would go back to building something. As a result, they didn't get into the cadence, nor did they get into the balance changes that they want to do for the long term.<br />Players should see stuff in 3.7, but should see a lot more in 3.8 and 3.9. Specifically, this new balance team will be doing general tuning passes, working on pip and targeting problems (which would include the gimble assist as well as the fixed gun problem), turret behaviours, making missiles it's own mode, working to encourage closer combat and penalise combat at higher speeds, accuracy and shield degradation, these types of things and more.

So it will have the same kind of impact, it will be unlocking new things. So kind of what we would do is we would be doing episode two or episode three, we'll also be adding some opportunity or have content that could be unlocked if you've done that in the PU, sort of like the match of it. I mean, we are actually starting right now the very early stages of, we already have, we had an outline of, you know, one, two, and three, and now we're in the process of starting to flesh out two and three.

So we captured Ian Duncan who played the player in all his scenes. So all his facial and body was captured as he was talking. And, you know, in fact, even for when we showed the IGN trailer, we internally created a third person and a first person version of it. You know, I opted for the first person because it felt more immersive and immediate. But, you know, we've long had the concept of potentially a sort of key that lets you pop out and get more third person set up. I mean, we've been experimenting with even in the first person conversations, having the option of sort of, you know, changing the camera angles a bit more cinematic. So, you know, one of the things we had in the vertical slice is we had these sort of cinematic cutaways. But maybe what wasn't fully obvious to people was that that's all happening, A, in real time, B, your character's there in real time. So we didn't show you, but you could, like, see the, you could go to the cinematic cutaways in, say, the white talking to Wexler in the briefing and, you know, you could have your character walk photo bomb in the back and walk back. And sometimes, you know, QA had done that. But the concept is really that, like, you have the cinematic cutaways and you can basically hit a key to just go back to your point of view. So it's sort of up to you. You can sort of cancel. You can just experience, like, even that scene. Like, you know, there's Ben Mendelsohn and Liam Cunningham, both great actors. So it's like, yeah, I want to see them up close. I want to see them. I want to see, you know, because if I'm looking at it from my point of view, when I've entered the briefing room, I'm not going to see all the detail or all the performance. And so we want the opportunity, so we're going to build a system. That's what we've been playing with, is building a system in that sort of has this sort of cinematic enhancement mode where, like, it will cut in there. But you don't want to deal with it.

GPS is just a function within a map... Right, so it's just telling where you are within these maps. Beacons, absolutely. So, you guys get an idea, we are working on all the gameplay related to this. The first step of that gameplay, it's something I showed in the procedural planet tech demo. Is the approach. I mean, if landing is going to take you thirty, thirty-five minutes. We looked up how long an actual transition for earth landings... How long atmosphere to ground really takes. It takes a long time. If we make it take that exact same amount of time. You're going to land one time, and you'll never do it again. <br/>FS: You're gonna be over it. <br/>ST: You're gonna need a half-hour of gameplay just to get to down to the planet's surface. ST: So that won't really work out. So one of the things we're working on is the Quantum Travel Beacons. Where you end up close to the planet enough that you can land within a reasonable amount of time. How many beacons we put on, whether that's automatic... Whether you manually do this all yourself, since it's all completely seamless, of course we want it to be manual. We also don't want it to take so long to do that you'll never want to do it. <br/>FS: Right, then it becomes a hinderance to your gameplay. <br/>ST: Exactly! So then once you get on the planet right. We need some level of... <br/>FS: Where are you?<br/>ST: A Global Map.<br/>FS: Isn't that the hardest thing? It's huge. <br/>ST: Totally, it's huge. <br/>FS: Even when you're working on it. You get lost sometimes. Like \"Where am I right now\"? <br/>ST: Yeah, and I put my own beacons in there sometimes. <br/>FS: Just so you can navigate around. <br/>ST: Right, so we're gonna need all these.We've talked a lot about this. Really, what it's going to come down to, is our first gameplay implementation of all of it. <br/>FS: Yeah.ST: Which is happening as we speak. Right. <br/>ST: This is something that we're working on internally. I don't know when you're going to see it. We're basically solving all these problems right now. As simple as, you're in zero G in your ship and you transition into gravity. Where the planet has local gravity. You've got physics and everything. So how does the ship flight change? How does it feel? Is it fun? That's really what matters. Once we get there, then you will be getting your maps, GPS, beacons. Things like this. I expect that you'll have that... <br/>FS: Your map changes too. You go from space, where there is no ground. <br/> ST: Yeah and it's all 3D. A 3D map... <br/>FS: ...Now you do have a horizon... <br/><br/>ST:: ...Versus a 2D representation of where I am. Yeah exactly...

Also, we have to make sure that people are building things that are like.. make sense inside the world. For instance, someone can't just build a ship with like 500 death guns on the front and the biggest thruster you've ever seen because that would unbalance the game. So, we're sort of thinking that perhaps we would say, 'so, here's an approved spec of a ship'. It can have these kind of guns, it can have these kind of thrusters, it will be this approximate mass or this size. You, the community, would come up with it and we would maybe do that not just for ships but perhaps guns or clothing items or other things and allow people to mod that and put that in. Then perhaps we could do something that would be along the lines of what Valve does on their stuff, to allow the people that create it to share in the revenue from that in some form or fashion. We haven't figured that out yet but long term it would be really great for the community to generate a fair amount of content because it's pretty hard to keep up with everyone's consumption rates and so we're really focused on creating systematic gameplay that really feeds into what players do and their actions generate other actions and other possibilities and other missions. That would also go into...it would be great if the community also was helping create ships, or weapons, or clothing items in the same way that our internal team is because we're hoping this will be a game that goes on for a long time, there will be lots of people playing it and so therefore there will be a lot of people who will want to have all these different things and we probably won't be able to keep up with it as well as we could without the community helping us out.

We don't have them on the horizon right now but those would be the ones we would do.  We probably wouldn't do the Vanduul ones because humanity is at war with the Vanduul, but can definitely see Xi'An and Banu ships in our Persistent Universe, so that would be sort of long term, but we have quite a few to finish up right now.  We still have several concepts that we owe, we have the Endeavor, the sort of science ship, we have the Crucible which is a repair ship, both of which are coming along and looking very cool.  We'll be sharing those in the near future and the Prowler, that's a boarding ship, I think it's Esperia but if not it would be Drake, but I think it's the Esperia Prowler and you know that's a boarding ship and we have to start working on the concept.  One other one that we are working on that I think will be something that you guys will like, and we'll be sharing that at CitizenCon because that's more military themed.

Like the power of your arrays, and the power you put to it. Also your CPU power will allow encryption and the level of encryption that can happen. So you will definitely have transmitting and receiving equipment, and you will definitely have the ability to do sort of interception and encryption. That will definitely be one of the aspects of gameplay you will have on one of the bigger ships. So someone can focus on that in terms of communication, disrupting the opponents communication, maybe even cracking the coded channels to hear what people are up to.

Will there be entire Prison Planets or at least Prison Space Stations?", "answer": "Great question, I had this very specific discussion with Tony a couple weeks ago about the PU. Things we want to do with the PU to make the universe seem more alive and real I mean. Typically, like in freelancer/privateer, all the action happens in space and then you go down onto the planet, which is a glorified shopping and mission interface, you can't get mugged or anything game-like there. The beauty of our engine is that it is a first person engine, so we can do everything on that level and for flying/vehicles we just have a higher level of simulation. This means that down on the planets we can do things like combat, adventure and intrigue etc. We don't want to make down on the planets a full PvP experience because that may not necessarily be fun for people, but I think it would be fun that there might be an NPC on a pirate-sort-of-world where you've got a tip-off to get a special mission down an ally way, and as you go down there two guys try to mug you, but you take out your blaster and deal with them han-solo style, I think that's going to be really cool. We're talking about building in those kind of encounters, so basically PvE scenarios that add life to places. So maybe you investigate a derelict wreck, maybe there are NPC pirates already there salvaging it or using it as bait to attack you, or there could be a crazy looking alien creature or whatever. We're creating a living and breathing universe, and one of the things we're talking about is the idea of bounty-hunting and capturing, so one of the things wouldn't be too cool is if you capture someone and basically troll someone by keeping them captured. We thought maybe there'd be a monetary penalty for having \"bribed your way out of prison\" to spawn on your pirate planet again. But one thing we could definitely do is if you're a wanted pirate and you're captured, you get put into the hold, it cuts to you arriving at a prison planet or space station, a very simple style FPS level, where you might have to break out. It might not be very difficult, or involved, but something that you have to do so it pulls you into an escape, maybe with a generic NPC getaway vehicle or a friend or something could be really really cool. That's one of the things we've been talking about. So what'll happen is when you're captured maybe you'll be in the hold for about a minute before you start your prison stuff, while the capturer has \"you\" to complete their mission (if it's a player). Then you escape, or pay, or whatever and then get back to your pirate ways. SO there definitely will be prison stations, perhaps some prison planets, but those are the kinds of things we want to do to make the universe liveable and breathable.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 42 (2014.10.20)", "source": "https://youtu.be/paE5gpEdltI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "The White Knight", "published_at_timestamp": 1413842404}, {"objectID": "373678690", "question": "Will organisations be able to establish some type of headquarters?

Definitely organisations will be able to have some sort of real estate, have a headquarters, we already talked about having some sort of persistent areas in space, like an asteroid base/derelict station that a group of players can take over and make their headquarters and defend it from other players.

And, you know, potentially longer-term we may decide \"oh yeah, well there's a new engine breakthrough\" and you can buy that from, you know, whichever the engine manufacturer is, and perhaps it has some fiction. But we'll definitely have some areas where you'll be able to upgrade your engines, and maybe plug in a different device.

We actually have a whole body/limb damage system.I think I mentioned in the Death of a Spaceman post about how when you get killed out in space, and you revive in the med bay, as you take more and more hits, then maybe you get a prosthetic arm or a robotic arm or something like that.We'll definitely have fairly decent damage in the first person stuff, and we've got medpacks and even a med bay. If you have a ship that has its own medical center, you may be able to take a player who normally if you didn't take him, he would lose a life and do the death of a spaceman, but if you could take him back to the med bay and fix him up, it saves him.Hopefully there will be a whole bunch of first person gameplay that would also involve you and you team boarding, and then you not only try to take the ship over, but if you take some hits and some gets hurt, you'll also want to be taking your wounded comrade back to a medical facility to fix him up within a certain period of time, because if not, he will die and lose a life. We're actually hoping to have some interesting, fun gameplay. Maybe some people fly around with a ship that has a med bay to fix people up if you're boarding, or all that kind of stuff.

The way I'm designing the game, the way I'm thinking about the game, is it isn't like that. There are just different things you can do. So it really depends on what you want to do. What is your definition of win. If you think about the real world, lots of people have different definitions of what makes them a winner. Is it they made lots of money, is it they've helped lots of people, that they're an amazing athlete, a great teacher. There are all these different definitions and they can all be achieved at different level. Some people achieve things they're happy with or greatness by themselves, some people do it in a group, and I think that's the model of Star Citizen. We're allowing things that you can do, if you just want to play by yourself and not deal with other people, there will be a game experience that will be very much like the old Priavteer/Freelancer experience that will feel like that and you won't feel like you're pressured into being in a big group. If you just want to play with a small group of your friends and go off and do stuff together, you'll be able to do that too. Or it you want to play in a really big group or organization and take over a part of space or build up a big trading empire you'll be able to do that. So I think the goal for us is to have lots of different things to do and of course on some of these bigger things, there will always be roles for people. Like a mining operation. Well there's someone that wants to own and build a mining operation, but then there might be people just like \"Hey I just want to be a miner and earn a buck, I'm there and I work for this corporation and do the mining.\" So I think that's a better way to think of it. It's not so much about 2-3 hours or 10-20 and you're competing against everyone else. It's sort of what you want to do in the game and I think you should be able to have fun with 2-3 hours, even if someone else is playing 10-20 hours. It's just you'll be doing different things, you won't be able to do as much stuff, but hey, that's the nature of things. But I definitely don't think you'll be not having fun only playing 2-3 hours, you'll just be doing potentially different stuff or less of it.
