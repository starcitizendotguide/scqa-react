In each episode, two guests of opposing views are brought on to debate key issues of the day. <em>Showdown!</em> has been canceled and revived multiple times. The most recent version has continuously broadcast since 2799 and is hosted by Eria Quint. </p><br/><h1>CURRENT FORMAT</h1><br/><p>The host of <em>Showdown!</em> opens every episode with a summary of the debate topic at hand, usually a current events news story. The host then introduces guests of opposing viewpoints to present their takes on the issue and debate it with one another. Generally, two guests are present, but sometimes the host will conduct a one-on-one interview or allow three or more guests to debate with one another. As the debate progresses, the host serves as moderator, asking questions as needed. Between one and five topics are covered per episode. </p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>The concept for <em>Showdown!</em> began in 2511, on Angeli (Croshaw II). Local politicians in Quinton would join radio news anchor Upasna Dixit to debate upcoming legislation. After nine years on the air, Dixit was approached by the now defunct news network Angeli On Air (AoA) to adapt <em>Showdown!</em> as a 30-minute current events debate program. Dixit signed for an undisclosed amount and began production on the new show. The first episode aired throughout Croshaw on 9 September 2521 in a late-night time slot.</p><br/><p><em>Showdown!</em> soon became popular and was shuffled to a more popular time slot. It saw high enough ratings that in 2522, SSN/CAtv bought the rights from AoA and broadcast it for the first time to an interplanetary audience that same year. In 2523, they launched a special series of episodes where various political experts, authors, and laypeople debated the merits and drawbacks of the new United Planets of Earth government without Dixit's moderation. However, the lack of an arbiter caused conversations to go off track, leading to a drop in the show's ratings. Ratings rose again when Dixit returned in 2524.   </p><br/><p>During Dixit's run as host, <em>Showdown!</em> covered such issues as first contact with the Xi\u2019an (2530), The outbreak of the First Tevarin War (2542 - 2546), and the ascension of Ivar Messer to the newly created office of Prime Citizen (2546). Dixit chose to retire after Ivar Messer created the position of Imperator, stating that she preferred not to lead debates on pros and cons of fascism. </p><br/><p>The new host, In\u00e1cio Santos Melo, developed a confrontational moderation style in contrast to Dixit's cool and impartial one, often aligning himself against his guests in heated three-way debates. Melo was criticized by other news networks for this behavior, but <em>Showdown!</em> experienced an upswing in popularity. This tone became the program's norm even after Melo's retirement in 2588. </p><br/><p><em>Showdown!</em> has been canceled and rebooted multiple times. It ran uninterrupted from 2547 to 2619. On 09 May 2619, <em>Showdown!</em> was canceled due to a dip in ratings. It was revived from 2648 to 2662, canceled again due to a contract dispute, and then brought back to fill an empty late-night slot from 2687 to 2697. It was one of many news programs to be censored into cancellation during the power struggle between Astrid Messer VII and Samuel Messer VIII (2697 - 2701), and wasn't revived again until 2718, three years after the ascension of Galor Messer IX. This version of <em>Showdown!</em> lasted until 2789, when it was censored again by the Messer government, this time for inviting SenatorTerrence Akari of Terra (Terra III) as a guest. It was revived for the fifth time in 2799 in the run-up to the ratification of the Fair Chance Act. </p><br/><p>Since 2799, <em>Showdown!</em> has been shuffled between time slots, but has not seen another cancellation.

Is that still the intent?", "answer": "Yes, they really want to allow Players to do that. As Luke was saying before, they build objectives in a simple manner, such as delivery missions where the Player picks up a box, and then drops it off somewhere else, although admittedly it's not that simple behind the scenes. However, it's not one mission but two objectives: pick-up, and drop-off, and they've built those separately. For example, in a mission where you steal a box, the first objective might be to do something first (like kill an NPC), but the end is the \"drop-off\" part of a delivery mission and they've just stitched those things together. As such, they could allow Players to take their objectives, and hopefully stitch them together into a coherent mission, after which the only thing to do is to decide what is being picked up and dropped off. It's a little like the Service Beacons, where when you're requesting a pickup the game always knows where you are so it's easy to determine what's being picked-up, and where it's going. For the Player-generated missions, they would need to expose all possible locations as an option because the box (or whatever) that's being picked up and dropped off, could be anywhere. This gets particularly interesting when the thing being picked up needs to be dropped off at a location that is secret or hidden, which therefore requires the Player completing the mission to have learned where that location is.", "time": "43m33s", "published_at_timestamp": 1564772763}, {"objectID": "947638990", "title": "Calling All Devs - Aspects of Flight and Landing", "question": "Why can we not decouple at cruise speed without losing speed anymore?", "source": "https://youtu.be/qBXUR6ppln8", "type": "youtube", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "time": "5m28s", "answer": "", "published_at_timestamp": 1533581032}, {"objectID": "947638620", "title": "Calling All Devs - Life Support & Phoenix Update", "question": "When you enter the Freelancer side door, the air lock vents the entire hip.

We can't do a cooperative story campaign where basically we let a friend of yours play the role of Old Man, which is played by Mark Hamill, because there's definitely things that are happening in the story that rely on other characters to do their thing. And if you have another player playing it, they may just decide, well, I'm not going to do that, all right, and then all of a sudden everything's going to break down. So our plan, I mean, you know, if you have Squadron, first of all, you'll have Arena Commander and Star Marine available to you to play with your friends. But also, as we go through the game, we were going to take some of the missions themselves, the combat, and then kind of have a kind of multiplayer version of it that you could play with some of your friends, maybe playing some of the other wingmen to achieve the objective that would be unlocked once you've done that in the story. So it wouldn't be for all of them, because some of them wouldn't make so much sense, but it would be for sort of the big battle opportunity. So there's some pretty big, you know, bigger battles or set pieces that, you know, there's a fair amount of AI that are fighting alongside you against a bunch of other AI. And in those cases, we could create some drop-in, yeah, drop-in, drop-out situations for that. It just won't necessarily be tied to the overall, you know, playing it through the story, because, you know, it's just...<br/><br/>JH: At the level of storytelling, we're attempting, yeah.<br/><br/>CR: Yeah, I mean, what happens if you decide, okay, we've got this big, you know, attack, and here's the good guys, and here's the bad guys, and there's, you know, 20 people on each side, but, you know, you make those 20 players on each side, and that battle may not end up the way that you want it to or need it to for the story, whereas if we've got you playing it with a bunch of other AI, we can sort of control or balance that better.", "title": "Star Citizen: Reverse the Verse LIVE - Squadron 42 Q&A", "source": "https://youtu.be/fS6FpCpt5m4", "type": "youtube", "published_at_timestamp": 1517055120}, {"objectID": "1239621931", "question": "What's up with the ship stats page?", "answer": "The ship stats on the website were made a long time ago and their stats are there to reflect what the design goal of the ship is.

[Stares]FS: That's a great question. So let me answer the first one. We are still heavy, heavy, heavy in developing the tech for customisation. So I do not have any direct answers, however what I can say is we will support the ability to get facial reconstruction and to change and customise your face.CH: Yes.FS: And we all know you will be able to customise your clothes to barely no end.CH: Yes I have seen you customising your clothes.FS: Yes and it's coming and I'm talking about it all the time and you've seen a taste of it now. So there will be the ability to customise your character's without a doubt. In regards to different heights for skeletons that's a whole tech we have not solved yet and there's lots of different ways that games solve the ability to scale. Unfortunately with CryEngine, the way that the animation system was built, it's a significant task. Its is not built into the engine, there's significant code that needs to be rewritten to support different heights for characters. It's something we will eventually have to tackle, but it's a much bigger task than it may seem or maybe it doesn't seem.It's tough and it's tricky and it's something that we do eventually probably will need to solve, but hopefully we get that in the near future.Any designs for the pressure sealed hood mask designs. So I don't know if this exactly falls under this category, but we are currently designing the OMC's. We all know, or maybe we don't know.CH: I don't know.FS: What OMC's are, but they are an organisation in the Squadron 42 universe. I don't know how much people know so I won't say anything else, but one thing that I will say, I just said I wouldn't say anything else, but I can't stop talking.CH [Laughs]FS: They have very cool outfits and their outfits are slightly different than the marines and infact the OMC will be similar to... when you currently play the Persistence Universe and you're running around with the marines and you see those other characters that are \"the pirates.\"CH: The pirates...FS: Okay, those are temporary characters that are getting replaced with the real characters with are the OMC and so those characters will have hood mask designs that are slightly different from the traditional spaceware because a lot of the art direction goes in the direction of... you know they don't just have brand new armour, they take previous armours. They've done some scavenging where they've got different parts and stuff and they customise everything. So maybe you don't have a full helmet, maybe it is... they built it and it's hand built and it's pressure sealed hood mask and they've created it and it's not something you just would generally pick off the shelf and get, maybe it's something they got multiple things they picked off the shelves and then created and that's kind of the visual direction that the OMC is.CH: They're creative, they did it themselves, DIY.FS: DIY, very DIYCH: DIY culture.FS: And I think that you will see some pressure sealed hood mask designs that are slightly different than traditional helmets spaceware and that's a great opportunity to implement those designs so I think we'll see that and it's going to be super cool. We already have some concepts in the works that are in the art direction phase and right now being looked at by Josh Herman, our new Character Art Director and Chris Roberts, obviously who's driving the vision and their going through the concepts and designing them right now and they're heading towards that direction so you should see something very cool in regards to that question.", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 14", "source": "https://youtu.be/hNOeZnMjVJo", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Fang of Asgard", "published_at_timestamp": 1465856012}, {"objectID": "373673880", "question": "When an impending release rears its head, roughly how much of the company would you say is devoted to getting the release out (Bugsmashing, testing, and so on)?

So I'm going to go help out with that.\" so he will take a day or so here or there and Paul has been a madman, he's been crazy.MA: He's been breaking out those..RV: Yeah dude-MA: It's been crazy.RV: He's been really helping out the 2.4 stuff and he's been focused on that so that way his team can continue just focusing on the feature and-MA: Mhm.RV: But he's a beast anyways like-MA: He is.RV: I mean, like, he- the amount of stuff he knows about the engine and the amount of stuff he knows globally is just insane. Like, my brain can only fit so much-MA: You could talk to him and say something and he'll like \"Give me a second, brain starts ticking and then spits out the answer\" and you're like \"OK\".RV: Yeah. it's- basically, everything, and that's every release, it's completely different. So the stuff we've got planned for 2.5 and going forward it's going to need different resources and this is going to be spread across all the different studios that we're working with, whether it's Frankfurt, UK, Austin or here in LA. Even the guys in Turbulent and stuff, we're all just working on different aspects of it and different things even for each release. So every release is it's own little snowflake.MA: And to add on to that, I can be working on this subset of stuff from the new items things and then I can't work on the next thing because I'm winning some from Patrick or even Chad so I take my code and put it on Preview and next thing I go \"I'm blocked with this, is there anything I can help with?\" and then I'll just help with some 2.4 stuff or some other things and then once I get unblocked I'll swap back.RV: And right now, I think I'm actually between you- between Paul, you and Chad Z now are the old people here, for engineers.MA: [nods]RV: You guys are basically the old crew and now we have a-MA: a new one..RV: a new engineers are coming and then hopefully when we can Humphreys he'll be kind of an old hat too because he knows the engine very well &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; he'll be another senior here.MA: He's not a Paul.RV: Yeah, It's going to be crazy having you three together.

If you want to play with a KB/M, or Joystick, Gamepad, and full remapping. If people have challenges with accessibility, they'll be able to remap and program their controllers (whatever they may be) to work with Star Citizen.Calix Reneau: And also, one of the core elements of Star Citizen is having these specialisation roles, so anytime we're making a new system it's about how deep can you go, and how deep do you have to go. In general that answer is you can go really deep, but you don't have to. Like, if you don't want to fly a ship, you don't have to, we have a full FPS game, and based on your playstyle and needs as a player, I think that philosophy of focussing on specialisation over a traditional progression system will mean people find a role that challenges them and enjoy at whatever level.

So, even back in the early days when we first launched the campaign in October 2012 there was people that like were sort of Origin fans, or there was people that were Anvil fans and people that were RSI fans. And it's kind of cool, 'cause I mean the whole goal was to sort of go with this idea of ship manufacturers being very much like car manufacturers. So you know you're into a BMW, or you're into a Mercedes, you're into a General Motors car or whatever. Whatever it would be. So, kinda like that.We definitely have this subsection called the Shipyard that's in our forums. We're really going to make this push. We've fallen away a little bit in the Ask The Devs section in terms of people being active and responding. So, we're trying to bring that back more to the forefront and focus of developers on spending a bit of time there. I mean the problem is obviously there's a lot of work to be done as you all know. And even though we've got a company of about three-hundred people now, they're all very busy trying to get both Squadron 42 and Star Citizen pushed forward as fast as possible. So sometimes getting on the forums and asking questions is something when they're having to have a bug they have to fix fairly far from their mind, but from our standpoint the community is kind of what made the game, what's enabled us to get where we are, and I think that debate's really good for not just the community but for us as well. To sort of see people's ideas and thoughts and maybe take them on if we agree with them.  So, we are going to be stepping up a bit more like that.I do, longer term we're going to ... we kinda want to establish the ships we've got and we really as the universe goes on it should be like the way that Ford is, and Fiat is, and BMW is and Mercedes is. The different manufacturers will sort of vy for each other for certain markets, and they'll do updates of ships. So, like longer term we won't redo the ship anymore. What we'll do is we'll have a new model of the ship just like oh here get the new 2016 Ford Escort or something, which will have different features, maybe a little different body style, but it'll be in the same car category. So longer term that's something we're planning to do once we've got our base foundation of ships in we're going to start to have fun with that to make it much more like you see in the real world. And again that will be fun.I think those are all the sort of elements where we take aspects of the real world and weave them into the fiction and the fabric of the universe of Star Citizen. It sort of feels sort of real because you sort of see analogies to stuff you know everyday in life and having rival ship manufacturers in the way there are rival car manufacturers in the real world is an element of that. So, there you go.I think Aegis right now is very strong, 'cause they've been doing quite well. The U.K. team is what you would call the Aegis team, although they are now branching out and doing RSI stuff on the Bengal carrier and a few other things. We've got the Drake team over here in the L.A. studio and in the Austin studio is I think they're going to be devs doing some pretty cool stuff. And I so we'll see what happens.  We've got to get back to doing some pretty cool Origin stuff and the MISC stuff has been going well. So, who knows. Lots of stuff to be done, lots of manufacturers to compete and lots of cool ships to be made.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 81", "source": "https://youtu.be/n6g-ECx-7xw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "[SCUM]Jizmak", "published_at_timestamp": 1459807296}, {"objectID": "373675130", "question": "Are there any plans to stream line the patch sizes?

We have a plan, in fact I sat down earlier this week which would be the previous week to you seeing this as we're recording this on a Friday and you're going to watch this on a Monday. But yeah I think we have a really cool plan that's very configured to our new development paradigm.Not saying new for us, but the new paradigm of what we're doing which is constantly building, testing, deploying both internally and then externally to, you guys in the community at first level the Public Test Universe the PTU then of course to live and so we needed a solution that we can can be building rapidly and iterating rapidly and getting it to you as efficiently as possible. And our current one is not the best because it has these big monolithic PAK files and each PAK file is two gigs and there's quite a few of them and if one file changes in it, you have to rebuild the whole PAK file and the way our build system works with all the data is we have to rebuild all the data into the PAK files right now, which essentially means we spend about three hours if we do a full build about an hour if we just do a code build.But that's a huge amount, so it's problematic in terms of getting that done and then testing it instead of there's an issue then you have to go back. So we want a solution that's much more flexible and iterative and we also want one that means we're not saturating everyone's bandwidth. Cause it's not just on you guys side but it's also on our side. Every byte we push costs us money 'cause it's coming off the Amazon CDN that we're using. So we have a plan that I think is much cooler, smarter one that is all built all around incremental builds of both data and code as soon as it's assimilated into the code base and all the individual files are tagged and held in a huge object store and the patch will know what to pull down and what changed.So even if you've changed a couple of files no longer will we be pulling down a whole new two gig object PAK or something like that. It will just be pulling down the specific files, it will also allow them to version back and forth between them. So there's a really really cool plan it's going to be done by combination of DevOps team in Austin and the folks in the Frankfurt office and Turbulent are all putting this together and building and it's going to be super cool!Not going to be deployed tomorrow. I just signed off on the whole design, we've laid a lot of the groundwork but a lot of it is going to take some time and testing but when it comes online it's going to make a massive difference for our ability to turn around builds for you guys quickly and also to reduce the amount of data that we saturate both our CDN and you guys on your bandwidth limits.

So we definitely want that.We have vents, that aren't in 2.0 but will be in in the future, where you can sneak around or crawl around in and outflank people and do stuff like that.Yes, I definitely see the combat in FPS being much more tactical and part of that would be allowing you to do stealthy stuff.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 74", "source": "https://youtu.be/qqcN6UkKfog", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Trickery", "published_at_timestamp": 1451947767}, {"objectID": "373680800", "question": "Will the initial launch of the Galactapedia contain only infos we have received so far and you add new stuff when you release a new spectrum dispatch?

There's so much stuff that's already been generated that maybe not everyone has caught up on, so to be able to put it in a format that'll make you guys easier to access it I think could keep you busy for ages.

So we're all working towards it, I know Cherie's super excited it's like her dream project.WW: Yeah, and then also what's really exciting as well is kind of this... consolidation and streamlining of information, cause i know right now we have bits and pieces all over the place, so it'll be great to pull it all together, as well as to have a definitive source. One of the problems that's risen from us being in live development as we release this information is that things have suddenly shifted over the course of two- three years we've been working on this, so some stuff from the very beginning whereas the spirit of it is still guiding us is very much true, we've had to adjust some of the details, and it's a little hard to keep that all up to date.

Illfonic are working round the clock on it, and many people in other studios are working on it as well.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Chris has some code up on his screen that he's helping with as well.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Lots of people working on it in the Frankfurt office as well.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; CryEngine's very powerful, but it's dense and complicated as well. Having the engineers that built it helps. They have the engineer that created CryAnimation, which is a great resource to have.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Working on closing out a few things.1. Networking (Networking's a bitch, whether on SC or any other game). Working on getting 32 players in Astro Arena and at least 16 in Gold Horizon. Ultimately want to push beyond there.2. Animations. Challenge on the animation is that most FPS games have first person and third person. First person is essentially a floating camera. Not physically realistic, but it's normally okay because you can't see your character. It's also why, when you get into mulitiplayer in something like Call of Duty, the animations aren't nearly as fluid. Player animation doesn't translate to what someone does in first person.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Real life has inertia. If SC were just doing an FPS, they could do what CoD does, but the foundation for the whole game is First Person. Because it's a multiplayer game, there has to be player controlled characters interacting with their environments, and that has to look good. CIG can't 'cheat' and put arms up where the eyes are, like many other FPS games do.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Means they have to unify first and third person together. If they can get it to work, it makes life simpler. Camera where the eyes are.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; They use tricks like camera stabilization &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; In real life, if you're running, your brain makes it so you don't look like you're bouncing up and down so much. That kind of logic has been built in.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Lots of work with animations. Lots of animations that can normally work for AI, but it takes more work to build them into player animations, and to keep them responsive and fluid, without hampering the player experience.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; This is one of the reasons FPS has been delayed. Not something you can say 'this'll take a week to do', it takes play time and experimentation time. Don't want to put it out if it feels slow or unresponsive, or if there are glitches. Yes, it's an alpha, but it will inherently hurt the feeling if the animations aren't in.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Making really good progress, hoping it'll be able to be played on PTU at or after GamesCom (don't hold him to that though).&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Definitely working really hard on FPS, and it'll be a great foundation once it's done. Definitely not 'indefinitely delayed'. More people working on it now than ever before.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; It's frustrating for CIG as well, they want it out as soon as possible as well, but if they're not happy with how it feels yet. When they do put it out, it will still have issues, it will still need polish, but it will be able to be played. More constructive for feedback.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Definitely thinking in terms of weeks, rather than a month.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; The delays don't have as much to do with the FPS portion either. If it was just an FPS, they could get it out. The delays have to do with the feeling of the PU as a whole. Rather do one thing right, rather than do two different ones and then have to waste time refactoring them later.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Frustrating, but it's a better way to look after everyone's money.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; FPS is foundational for the whole game.&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Apparently Crytek had talked about doing this sort of first and third person unification on Crysis 2 and 3, but gave up because they had deadlines. CIG have made more progress than when Crytek were trying.

I am curious with all this detail are the ships a one shot thing on the production end or when talking this level of professional work are they built in parts and stuck together and then its the CryEngine that turns them into a singular mesh?", "answer": "Forrest Stephan: So, that's obviously a very complicated question, but we can give a very simple explanation I think of how we do it. We use a 3D program and the first thing we do is we block it out, we get it over to Design, they approve it (obviously this is after it's been concepted) and then we block it out further and make sure that everything's functional and everything's working and it's still meeting all of the design specifications that have been made by our Designers, by Ben, by Chris Roberts, and then we continue the process, get it flyable, get some thrusters on it, make sure that it actually flies okay, and then we, and this is just the blocked body of the ship, and we have the interior and all that stuff, so then we get to the more fine detail, and at that point you export out your ship as a whole, but it doesn't include the weapons and the components, those get dynamically spawned in the engine. So while somebody's building the ship, somebody else 's building components, somebody else's building the weapons, and then through XML and scripts it calls the correct weapon and the correct thing at the right time, then we have this entire back end database that knows what the ship is, what needs to go on it, so it knows how to call the script, and then it knows obviously the users and what the users own and what they have, and that stuff gets dynamically, i'ts like magic. Actually, I don't know how it works. I have no idea how it works.Omar Aweidah: Lot of time. Lot of time. Space magic.FS: It's space magic, yeah.OA: And then from a design perspective, I mean, it's really really hard because each ship is based upon a concept. Sometimes it's just the hull of a ship that gets approved, so you have to figure out all of the spacial volumes inside, and not all of it always works all the time, what areas of the ship are modular, like, where can we re-use assets in ships, but have it true to form.FS: And that's something we've really been concentrating on, making sure we have our manufacturers and we're kind of starting to do a great job of getting styles for manufacturers, and then reusing stuff. If you have a weapon rack that's made by Aegis for example, why can't it be reused in this Aegis ship and this Aegis ship, so the idea is we're really starting to nail down the direction of the art, and really starting to get this modular system rolling, so obviously ships take a long time the first time you do it, the second time you do it they get faster, and faster, and faster, and the more kits we make out of these ships, and the more pieces we can piece together, and the more modular framework that we already have built allows us to build these ships much faster and speed up development time, which obviously is always a great thing for us and for you guys.OA: Cause these ships, they really are a remarkable undertaking. If you even knew how long they actually take from the beginning to the end, because we focus on every minute bit, and also every animation with every button you touch, getting into the ship, how the ship flies, the HUD, we have designers who design everything. Zane upstairs is doing just what you see when you're flying it, to the point of everything else , there's so much that goes into it, and how long the concept, getting the concept approved by everybody, being like this is what we want, moving that forward, to this areaFS: I don't know how we ever get a ship done. We've got like, 21 of them.OA: And some are being redone. Which is a good thing. Because the ships we built early on, as we've grown we've been like, oh wait here's a better way to do this. So when we realize that we can give a better product, that's when we go back, revisitFS: A better product, and we want to make sure everything's compatible. So while we were working hard at first, eventually you have to start working smart, and that's when we started figuring out that there is a lot more modular ways to do it. And also we figured out how to utilize the engine better so we can optimize the ships better, so when a ship loads up it doesn't take six seconds, it takes a couple milliseconds, so we want to make sure that every ship that's going into the game has the same level of efficiency, and the same level of quality. So I think there's a couple ships, the Gladius, the Retaliator, the Merlin, they've hit those bars now, and that is our bar, and the techniques and the ways that we're doing it, so now we're going back and trying to make sure all the other ships are up to par with those. And that way, if we do have things modular, we can be swapping everything out, right?OA: Totally.FS: Cause we really want this flexible universe.OA: I like what you said, work smarter, not harder.FS: But some people know what it's like to build a ship. For those that remember the next great starship, we had tons of teams build ships for us, and when I talked to them when they came and were on the show, they were like, it 'aint easy. No, no it's not.OA: And then they come and build a ship here, and it's still equally as difficult, even with the support of a team.", "title": "10 for the Artists: Episode 03 (2015.06.15)", "source": "https://youtu.be/WhiriMAEtOE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Filan Fyretracker", "published_at_timestamp": 1434409246}, {"objectID": "373682790", "question": "What photographic or other sources do you use to inspire the space artwork in Star Citizen?

We have running galleries of a lot of stuff, and I'll look at a lot of planes, a lot of tanks, a lot of cars, I just slowly, whenever I see a surface I like, I grab it, I put it in a folder, and I save it for later. So I have a library in my head of, if I was going to build an Aegis ship, I'd be like, so Aegis is kind of militaristic, scary, industrial, panzer. That black, slightly glossy paint, you know, that kind of thing. So it's not so much a matter of texture reference for photo source, it's building up a reference, and one of the things I keep catching artists doing is they will constantly look at other computer graphics to draw inspiration from, and the key to creating believable materials is drawing all your reference from real world things.Lance Powell: Exactly. I think, to add to the question, and round out the PU, you also touched on it. We're building a Universe that's meant to be accurate. So, if there's a red giant, or there's a brown dwarf, or there's a white dwarf, we're shooting for something that's meant to be plausible. I think that from the concept creation side, the concept artists go out there and create the look they want based off of a feeling they're trying to capture, but then the production artists get their hands on it, and we dial it in towards the real world.", "title": "10 for the Artists: Episode 02 (2015.05.18)", "source": "https://youtu.be/shxj7XXKgr4", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "AragornBH", "published_at_timestamp": 1431986585}, {"objectID": "e0b128b9d1206_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "This will depend largely on the room; some ships (especially larger ones like the Idris and Javelin) will have rooms that could apply to multiple ships, whereas smaller ships like the Starfarer will likely end up with primarily unique rooms (although models and props can be reused between them, for ease of art and development!

And so that landing instance is sort of unique to you, but if it's a bigger planet and you're on a bigger spaceport, there would be sort of landing areas off in the distance, which you can't reach yourself directly. And what we're planning to do in those landing areas is to sort of, you know if it's a big spaceport maybe there could be 6 or 7 slots in it, and a smaller one would only [have] 2 slots. But we would have ships come and go from those landing spots of in the background, and that would be sort of determined by who was coming and going from the planet, or what NPCs were coming and going from the planet, and who you saw would be sort of dictated by who your friends are, who your enemies are, what your designated persons of interest are. So it could give you some indication of the comings and goings of other players or NPCs to a limited amount where it feels like you're on a living location. But your own spaceport instance is really only accessible by you, so even if you see the stuff off in the distance, you can't sort of jump over there and try and steal their ship.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 37 (2014.09.15)", "source": "https://youtu.be/HJnqq7DX68A", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "LlydM", "published_at_timestamp": 1410816374}, {"objectID": "373683230", "question": "Can you stay in the UEE Military for some time?

We are planning on having stories that... think of it like a mission pack in the old Wing Commander days, where we'll have a story that we will make and build, and make available to backers, for whatever you want to call it - DLC or something. It would have the sophistication of a Squadron 42 story line that will come back online down the road. Occasionally people can participate in that if they so desire, and some of those will be military-based, like you re-enlisting back in the military for a campaign. And we're also thinking about having certain things that you could do as a player, where like maybe the the military needs some contractors to help secure a star system Vanduul incursions, or help flesh out an attack on Vanduul space. Those will be sort of PU missions, so there will be a little bit of that. There's not really a game setup where you stay in the military and work your way through ranks.It is a cool idea, and longer-term I think probably kind of be some of the professional stuff that we would expand once the game is up and running and we're adding new content, because I think that's definitely a career path that a lot of people would to choose.
