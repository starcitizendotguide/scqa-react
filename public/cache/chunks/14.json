[{"objectID": "bZkOavLgjB-headhunters", "answer": "The Headhunters are a major criminal organization based in the Pyro system that specializes in smuggling, theft, and protection. Originally from the Virgil system, the gang first rose to prominence as smugglers in the 2610s, when they established a fast shipping route from Virgil to Terra through Nyx and Pyro that proved to be difficult for authorities to detect. By the 2620s, they fully relocated to Ruin Station, where they could more easily avoid encounters with the Advocacy. It was during this era that they adopted the Human skull into their symbolism, and began including motifs of it in tattoos, personal decor, and graffiti. A location marked with a Headhunter skull warned other criminals that the area was under their control. Much of Pyro stayed under their influence until the criminal syndicate the Drop Kings challenged their authority in the 2740s in an effort to expand their smuggling network, resulting in a series of conflicts that caused control of Ruin Station to pass back and forth between the gangs for several decades. The Drop Kings ultimately withdrew when they clashed with another criminal syndicate in 2912. Since then, the gangs are officially on neutral terms, though they maintain a sense of rivalry.

So it's pretty well. But what it did teach to do it to be very tight on getting everything in, schedule, JIRA up and so forth.On Star Citizen, there's nothing to compare to Star Citizen even games i've worked on in the past like Strike Commander, which you know we worked on for a few years and so forth.

We actually spent a lot of time last year getting us to 2.0.But it's also just the scope of it all, and we're trying to build two games: Squadron 42 and Star Citizen. And we're trying to build a company. And we're trying to do all these things in one big go. So the basically, it's very hard to compare anything but I have. But I'll say with Star Citizen is by far the hardest thing i've ever done. It's also, I am actually really enjoying it obviously. But in terms of what you were saying, the experiences were, that I think we are, we are getting very tight on the, although we have so much to do, we are getting very tight on getting the scheduling down, what we need to do to get these things happening. So that's the biggest lesson I had from before.", "published_at": "2016-03-28", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 80", "source": "https://youtu.be/zvm1jW_Xp_8", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Hyper-X", "published_at_timestamp": 1459202407}, {"objectID": "373675560", "question": "You mentioned last week  that the current plan is to continue the development of FPS on the Crusader map and when the time is right, enable Star Marine with the FPS feature suite functionality implemented at that time. Could you give us your thoughts on the continued development of Arena Commander? Is the continuation of space flight development shifting to Crusader map from now on as well?", "answer": "I best way to think about it, because it does drive me crazy that people keep thinking that Star Marine is a separate game, Arena Commander is a separate game. They are just facets of the overall game, the overall game is essentially what you get when you're flying around Crusader in 2.0/2.1, that we're going to be building on from and that idea was going to be sort of seamless between flying a spaceship, running around on foot whether you're running or just talking to someone.It's all from first person, it's why we call it first person universe. Travels massive distances, millions of kilometers, arrive at your location, get out of your ship, walk around, all going to be seamless. From now on most of the featured development iteration is really focused on the 2.1 sort of Crusader, we're actually shifting it, it's going to be... Crusader's just a small part but really it's the Stanton system. You'll be seeing that in the next, not necessarily 2.2 but 2.3/2.4 onwards, it will be fleshed out to be Stanton and we'll have those distances in there and you'll be able to travel around areas, then eventually go down and land on some of the locations.That is where the core gameplay is really going to be fleshed out because that is the PU experience, you behave quite differently in let's say Arena Commander and you will behave differently in Star Marine then you would in the proper Persistent Universe. Flying around, going from location to location, fighting people because obviously you respawn easily in Arena Commander and you get your ship back. In the real world, or the Persistent Universe, it's not going to be so easy, you're not going to be back in the action quite as well and you got to get your replacement ship and all the rest of the things.So, the whole idea of Arena Commander and the idea of Star Marine was really to sort of test out all the mechanics before we had all these things and been able to in one place but they're all in one place now so really where we want to be doing the mechanics is in the final destination, which is what the Persistent Universe will be. Now that doesn't mean that Arena Commander and when we turn on the Star Marine game mode, those two won't get love because we do understand that it is kinda nice to go in there and just practice your combat skills and don't have to deal with anything else or worry about getting your insurance ship back, reconfiguring your weapons to the way you liked it, flying back.You'll respawn/come to in a medical bay on the last friendly planet you made and that may be quite a distance away from where you died. We understand, Arena Commander you want some fast action, you want to get in there, you want to hone your dogfighting skills, you want to practice that. That's what that's good for, it's the same for Star Marine. That's all really about honing the FPS skills, exactly the same skills you'll be using in the Persistent Universe.That's why when I said last week when we were talking about it, it's no difference, it's FPS is what it is. I think I've seen all this noise about, 'oh, they've just thrown all this stuff out'. No we haven't thrown this stuff out, it's just that we don't want to bring all of the pieces online until they're all sort of... like the animation is properly polished and there's a bunch of little edge cases that had to be dealt with. You know the paradigm in development is, it's fairly easy to get 80% of the way there, it's the last 20% that takes 80% of the time and I would say that a lot of the FPS stuff probably would fall into that category.We just want to make sure that it works smoothly, so grenades and throwing it and gadgets, some of the other stuff we showed before when we did some of the demos is all still in there we just have it disabled at the moment. We need to make sure that they're polished and fully working well with all the other systems because when you're in the overall set up, you're not just doing FPS. We need to make sure it all works and plays well together.It's complicated, it takes more time but it's all happening there. So, the idea is Star Marine and Arena Commander will be both your sort of practice modes and yes, you can have some competitive games, where you might want to test your mettle against someone who's the best fighter pilot, who's the best on ground shooter, that's kind of what they'll be good for. Really they're just practicing for you existing in the Persistent Universe cause that's really where you need to have your skills.So, we'll tweak things, improve some of the game modes, at some point the matchmaking needs to be significantly improved and we'll sort of make all that be better but that's a lower priority to us. Building the PU structure out is sort of important and to be honest with you is actually super cool and super fun, that is an experience you don't get anywhere else where as yes, maybe I can just go dogfight in a bunch of other space sims or maybe I can run a gun in a bunch of other FPS games, but you can't do what you can do now in 2.0/2.1 in any other game.That's what's kinda cool about it. That's where our focus is, like I said Arena Commander, Star Marine, there's is sort of game modes, games within games to help you practice. They will be there and they will supported, they're less important than delivering the main experience which is what you're going to get in the Persistent Universe.", "published_at": "2016-02-01", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 76", "source": "https://youtu.be/GOyEcb5jJfE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Shrike", "published_at_timestamp": 1454367842}, {"objectID": "1cced81c063b6b_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "We're still working out many of the plans for post-launch, but the current idea is that the Reliant (and similarly priced 'tier 2' ships) would be part of slightly more expensive packages.

It was originally thought of as the only way to save and logout in space. Many thought it was a balance between the single seaters.", "answer": "Elwin Bachiller: Right now, that's where it is still at. You go out into space, hop into your little bed, go to sleep and that's how you can kind of log off in space and it might save your state out there. It's something that we still have to prototype and test to see if it actually makes it in as a game mechanic.So... I guess the answer to that question is... Maybe?Lance Powell: What about things that you're working on right now like the component swap?EB: Yeah, so components... ultimately what we'll want to do is build our components... which will include beds and sinks and toilets and bathrooms and things like that - build it so that we can just use them on every ship, or as many ships as possible so we can reuse the assets and that bakes in the ability to potentially customize the interiors. Now, do not take me at my word on that because the smaller ships are all basically custom interiors. You will not be able to swap out an Aurora bed for a Mustang bed for example, it's not gonna happen... but it might be possible in the future. We're kind of trying to build our assets to make that a possibility later on.Now, the other components such as fuel tanks, ammo boxes, powerplants, ballasts - like we have... I don't even know how many... in the 10s of different types of components which are all completely swappable across all ships of the same class. So, there's a little bit of that going on and all of those components definitely have heavy gameplay implications. For example, if you have an ammobox on one side of your ship that is now adding mass to one side of your ship. The handling of your ship is going to take a hit as a result of that. The avionics will still compensate in order to make it as unnoticeable as possible but the moment you start using the weapon and the weapon starts drawing ammo from the box, you start losing mass which changes the handling of your ship and every component, depending upon its location on the ship will affect the mass at that location which then changes the rotation speed. It affects the physics in a major way. I'm not the best person to talk about how the physics work but the whole thing is going to be awesome.", "published_at": "2015-05-18", "title": "10 for the Artists: Episode 02 (2015.05.18)", "source": "https://youtu.be/shxj7XXKgr4", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "KeyserSose", "published_at_timestamp": 1431986585}, {"objectID": "14f77f63245f2b_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "These situations are all bad news; we want refueling to be a challenging process, so failures and collisions should cause significant damage to ships.", "published_at": "2015-05-15", "published_at_timestamp": 1431640800, "question": "What have the developers envisioned as far as mishaps during inflight refueling?

It is something that we talked about with the Cutlass variants, immediately following Cutlass-gate, as you might remember. The idea of making modular ships is both-... well, it's more fun for the community, right? 'Cause you can kind of buy one variant but then go find, or collect, or otherwise purchase the component parts to make it into another variant, mix and match, and it kinda allows for a lot of custom options. So the Cutlasses are undergoing that treatment from Foundry 42 right now. When we talk about larger ships like the Constellation, it's funny 'cause, well, I don't know that we'd actually talked about that, but that kind of the system that we're wanting to move to for a lot of the, umm... I called them \"sub-capital but bigger than a single-seat fighter\" kind of a ship - where they'll have larger interior spaces with form and function - so that as long as all of them subscribe to a similar layout on the interior space, we should theoretically be able to swap out different functional areas. So like, say if you have a med-bay that is a certain size and has this number of sleeping pods, maybe that's exchangeable for a bounty hunter holding cell area with similarly shaped logic there.

The Hornet has gone through quite a lot of changes, it looks a lot better, it has moved to PBR, it has higher res textures, more geometry added to it, and the same is also happening to the 300i, it has had a significant upgrade.And I think that we will be sort of following the car model where we will be occasionally upgrading the ships and also upgrading their performance and changing around the stuff, because I think it would be very cool to make it like cars where models change out and you can have a collector's edition or something like 1965 corvette was a classic and I love touring around in it.So yeah, I think that's very much in the spirit, and it's definitely something we're doing, so great question Traveling Matt.", "published_at": "2014-06-30", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 27.

Which, for us the profit's all extra money we put towards the game, so we like to have some things that, if we even sell physical goods, there's a bit of a profit in it so we can make a bigger, better game.We try to avoid to do physical items that are basically break even, because that requires a lot of man power and a lot of thought and a lot of juggling, and also customer service headaches 'cause, you know, did you get your package, did it get through customs, all the rest of the stuff.We have staff that do just deal with that, and obviously that's stuff that we could be spending money working on the game instead.

You'll be able to turn a much tighter turn because you're gonna be g limited.So your flight control system will essentially keep you inside the limits of what your body can take. If you're going very fast, and you try to pull a tight turn over a very short period of time, you'll experience a huge amount of g's and you'll black out. We're modeling g-lock, and all that kind of stuff. So that will be a reason not to fly at max velocity.Other reasons will be use of fuel, because when you're at max velocity, it's just like a car, you're not gonna be as efficient, and then we have wear on components, and we do model wear and upkeep.So you'll actually see your ship get grime and dirt and age over time as you play.
