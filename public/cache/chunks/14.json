It was her initiative that led the company to purchase Stanton I from the United Empire of Earth (UEE) in 2865. The third moon of Hurston is named in her honor. She was succeeded as CEO by her son, Gavin E. Hurston.</p><br/><h1>EARLY LIFE</h1><br/><p>The oldest child of Chesterfield Hurston and Mariah Park Hurston, Magda was born in 2833 on Rytif (Bremen II) at a hospital near the site of Hurston Dynamics' secondary headquarters. She received her early education on Earth (Sol III) and attended the Haymore School of Economics in Geneva for her undergraduate and graduate degrees, where she attained a Master of Science in Organizational and Social Psychology. Her dissertation, <em>Live, Work, and Play: Employee Productivity in Controlled Environments</em>, was selected as one of the winners of the Best Dissertation Prize for the 2854/2855 academic year. After a year-long internship at the University of Persei Analytical Research and Quantification (UPARQ) on Persei (Rhetor II), she joined the family business in 2856, starting as an Associate Operations Analyst.</p><br/><h1>HURSTON DYNAMICS</h1><br/><p>Magda moved upward through the ranks despite several clashes with distant relatives in higher positions, eventually becoming Chief Operations Officer in 2863. During this period, she made multiple cost-saving operational changes to Hurston Dynamics, such as utilizing nutritional supplements instead of fresh ingredients to reduce the cost of employee meals and opting for in-house production of worker protective equipment in place of renewing expensive outsourcing contracts. In 2865, she spearheaded her largest project: the purchase of governing interest and settlement rights for the naturally habitable planet Stanton I and its four moons from the UEE. It was under her advice that then-CEO Chesterfield Hurston agreed to the unprecedented expense. The changes they could make to the weapon manufacturing process, out from under the strict laws of the UEE, would save the company trillions. Chesterfield approved, and the planet Hurston was officially established.</p><br/><p>While Hurston Dynamics' mining division broke ground on antimatter precursor mines on the surface of Hurston, Magda supervised the design and construction of the first residential buildings that would later form the heart of the Workers District. She took a brief break in 2867 after the birth of her son Gavin. When Hurston's first antimatter refinery plant was completed in 2872 and workers began to arrive, the need for a much larger settlement became apparent. Magda spent five years identifying areas to cut costs so that new construction could be built quickly and at low price. The city of Lorville was officially founded in 2877.</p><br/><p>In 2883, halfway through the erection of Central Tower, Hurston Dynamics' new headquarters, Chesterfield died after a short battle with pancreatic cancer. Magda succeeded him as CEO. Under her leadership, daily work hours were extended for those under the Life/Labor contract, and a weekly task-completion competition to shorten workday minutes was introduced. These changes improved overall efficiency by 3%. She oversaw the completion of Central in 2890, as well as a wide expansion of the company's antimatter mining, processing, and weapons construction. The contract she signed to provide the UEE military with antimatter warheads netted record profits. She continued her father's strip-mining operations, exempt from the UEE's anti-pollution laws thanks to the planet's independent status, allowing speedy and cheap extraction of Hurston's natural resources.</p><br/><p>She retired as CEO in 2915 and was succeeded by her son Gavin, though she stayed on the board of Hurston Dynamics in an advisory capacity.</p><br/><h1>DEATH</h1><br/><p>While en route from the Hurston Central building to Teasa Spaceport, where she was planning to travel via a private service to her family's vacation home on Cassel (Goss II), her shuttle suffered a mid-flight collision with another shuttle.

Originally constructed by the United Empire of Earth (UEE)Navy to provide repair facilities for their capital ships, Crusader Industries looked at the existing infrastructure as an ideal location for their commercial shipbuilding operations. Over time, as the city drifts from its position, it must be occasionally moved into safe orbit by the synchronized firing of large thrusters built into each platform. Due to the gas giant Crusader's natural beauty and the presence of unique fauna such as the stormwal, Orison has become a popular tourist destination for visitors to the Stanton system. Cloudview Center serves as the main hub for habitation, tourism, and commerce. The Skyway Shuttle provides public transportation between platforms. </p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>In the mid-2800s, the discovery of natural hydrogen and oxygen on the low-mass gas giant Stanton II made waves in the UEE. Colonization of a gas giant, long considered impossible, was now in reach. Initially, the planet was claimed by the UEE Navy, who constructed a series of platforms in 2855 designed to float in the upper reaches of the atmosphere in a region with gravity friendly to Human as a way to work on its capital ships in a breathable atmosphere. For a few years, a skeleton crew served on the platforms, conducting repairs as needed for the vessels that passed through the system. </p><br/><p>When the UEE made the decision to offer Stanton II up for sale in 2865, CEO of Crusader Industries Kelly Caplan purchased it. She considered the latticework of platforms the ideal place to save credits on the manufacture of their massive ships. After officially taking possession of the planet, CI converted the main capital ship repair drydock, Providence Platform, into a manufacturing center for commercial spacecraft. The company went on to save 40% on ship construction costs after only a year. </p><br/><p>Caplan's success earned her a position of trust with the board of directors, who were initially skeptical of her plan to buy Stanton II. Her next proposal, to use a portion of the company's new profits to develop the platforms beyond the shipyard complex, was approved the day the documentation was submitted. She named the settlement Orison after an old Human word for \"prayer,\" in reference to what she described as the \"meditative nature\" of Crusader.</p><br/><h1>CITYSCAPE</h1><br/><p>Named after the founder of CI, the August Dunlow Spaceport is the city's main point of entry and is connected via Skyway Shuttle to the industrial district's Providence Platform and the commercial and residential district's Cloudview Center. The Cloudview platforms contain residences, shops, places to eat and drink, a Crusader Industries Showroom, Orison General Hospital, the Crusader Visitor's Center, and other amenities. Parks and other plant-filled areas built to invoke nature are scattered throughout each district. The iconic hosanna tree that decorates the walkways was created by CI to withstand high winds and low humidity, to self-pollinate, and beautify Orison with its pink flowers.</p><br/><h1>TOURISM</h1><br/><p>Orison enjoys a steady stream of tourists to the Stanton system, drawn to Crusader for its scenic aspects and unique ecosystem. Visitors interested in the skies of Crusader can visit the Grande Observatory underneath the visitor's center, which provides views of Crusader's prismatic clouds. Storms deep in the atmosphere can be observed there, along with passing animals that live their lives in the air.</p><br/><p>One such animal, the stormwal, is another of Orison's main attractions. A colossal creature that can grow up to 100 meters long, the stormwal is a planktivore that subsists on the thousands of tiny plankton-like animals that float in the currents of the wind. Enthusiasts can board a Discovery Tour to visit the nearby Stormwal Sanctuary and observe these majestic fauna in their natural habitat.

We'll skip ahead.<br/><br/>CM I mean, I can give a, maybe I can answer a question that they didn't ask. Which is, is auto loading always going to work the way that it does now? Sure. We're gonna build on that. Right now, auto loading is built into the commodity trading experience in part because that was the quickest way that we could do it. I think we'll always want to have that because it's convenient in order to just make those decisions when you're doing trading. However, there are times when it would be convenient to auto load things that aren't necessarily part of a transaction or after a transaction. <br/><br/>JH: Like mission cargo can't be auto loaded.<br/><br/>CM: Mission cargo, but also items in general that you have. Maybe you want to load those into the ship. And so a full auto loading experience is a feature that we're currently looking at as far as making it to where you can just have whole sets of stuff. If you just don't want to touch the freight elevator, you just don't like it, that's fine. We're looking at having an experience for you to where you can say like, okay, I want this arrangement of stuff. And as long as it fits into the cargo grids on the ship, then it'll move them around. And now that we've made it to where the cargo grids support so many different items, that means that there's a lot more opportunity to make that work. Of course, there'll be a small fee associated with it, but it will, I think, support, it's kind of a bigger solution to, instead of just like solving it specifically for mission items, it's something that you can do more generally. And then also, we talked about small vehicles, ground vehicles, getting those into your ship. Well, that would be a solution, right? If you didn't want to drive it out yourself.<br/><br/>JH: Now, not just spawning a ground vehicle in the cargo, but spawning a ground vehicle in a cargo crate.

It's gone on a bit of an arc and I don't think that arc is completely finished. What's funny about that arc is we've kind of ended up where we started actually because in the original proposal for the item bank, it works like it does now actually, which is it's the personal inventory UI and really the item bank is more of an interaction point to trigger that UI. And the reason to understand why that makes sense is because to think about what you're doing at the item bank. What you're doing really is we're trying to make it easier to get things that make sense from like a FPS player perspective, right? So if you wanna get meta pins, you wanna get armor, a weapon, these kinds of smaller items, which are often equipment. We wanna make that intuitive and easy and quick, frictionless. The personal inventory UI makes sense for that because it has the paper doll view where you can pull things over and like kind of very more tangibly interact with the player and more quickly equip and un-equop, swap things out, etc. <br/><br/>However, the personal inventory UI, I think everyone that's played the game knows it's not perfect and there's things that we have long wanted to do about it. And in fact, for this release, it was one of the things that we hope that we could get to, but we didn't have the time to. That's still, we're still going to come back to making improvements to that UI. So for that reason, we had some internal discussion on iterating on it and looking at it. And after we had gotten the Freight Elevator Kiosk UI to a pretty good place, I think people saw before that we originally had this more 3D-based UI on the left-hand side of the Freight Elevator Kiosk, which we may come back to at some point with some rethinking. But when we went to the more like kind of straightforward like grid view and then added certain things like search and better filtering, that experience started to develop in a way that had some functionality advantages over the personal inventory UI. So we had some discussions internally and decided that we would try moving it over to use just the Freight Elevator Kiosk UI rather than the personal inventory UI. And there was trade-offs, of course. So like some of the like faster, tangible, easier kind of changes are gone, but you have other things like search and filtering that are better. And after giving it to y'all and collecting a lot of feedback and internally, we had to make a call. It was one of these things where there was very strong voices actually on like kind of both ends of it. So I think no matter what, some people, you know, it actually, I just went to a bar citizen in Seattle. It was funny, like I talked to people and it was like, someone would say, man, I'm so happy you made that change and that somebody else would be like, why don't you bring back the Freight Elevator Kiosk UI and the item vague. But I think the answer is gonna be, we're gonna probably keep it like it is now, but bring over some of the things from the Freight Elevator Kiosk UI like the search functionality to make that a better experience itself.

For us, Chris is our benchmark, Chris is the one at the top paying attention to everything, and he\u2019s got a trusted team driving that vision that allows us to achieve the goals that he set out at the beginning. Naturally, as systems come online \u2013 and this is with all game development \u2013 it inspires other ideas, and creativity. Which is one of the fun parts of developing new systems, that we\u2019re doing for Star Citizen. But how we\u2019re maintaining that is, we\u2019ve got our original idea for what Star Citizen is going to be, and Chris is still driving it, from the beginning, we\u2019ve all been clear on what it is we\u2019re trying to go for.

Have those previous experiences affected how you operate in the CIG environment in any way?", "answer": "[Special Episode with answers from Erin Roberts]Very much so I think probably the one, the biggest effect on me, was probably working on the Lego games. When I was working on them, I worked on the games for close to ten years. We had very tight production deadlines we had to get through.So we were basically delivering games every four to six months. Which means we had to be very tight in what we're doing. And the Lego games, that's quite easy to do because basically you have one set of core tech, you take your franchise whether it's Star Wars or something else, and you basically then you skin it and you put in one or two new features and then you get it out and you create the game. So it's pretty well. But what it did teach to do it to be very tight on getting everything in, schedule, JIRA up and so forth.On Star Citizen, there's nothing to compare to Star Citizen even games i've worked on in the past like Strike Commander, which you know we worked on for a few years and so forth. It was still just a flight simulator there's a lot of tech going on. But Star Citizen's not only building the tech up which we have to do, as well as the gameplay to support what we're doing, which is a massive deal in terms of, getting it from working. We actually spent a lot of time last year getting us to 2.0.But it's also just the scope of it all, and we're trying to build two games: Squadron 42 and Star Citizen. And we're trying to build a company. And we're trying to do all these things in one big go. So the basically, it's very hard to compare anything but I have. But I'll say with Star Citizen is by far the hardest thing i've ever done. It's also, I am actually really enjoying it obviously. But in terms of what you were saying, the experiences were, that I think we are, we are getting very tight on the, although we have so much to do, we are getting very tight on getting the scheduling down, what we need to do to get these things happening. So that's the biggest lesson I had from before.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 80", "source": "https://youtu.be/zvm1jW_Xp_8", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Hyper-X", "published_at_timestamp": 1459202407}, {"objectID": "373675560", "question": "You mentioned last week  that the current plan is to continue the development of FPS on the Crusader map and when the time is right, enable Star Marine with the FPS feature suite functionality implemented at that time. Could you give us your thoughts on the continued development of Arena Commander? Is the continuation of space flight development shifting to Crusader map from now on as well?", "answer": "I best way to think about it, because it does drive me crazy that people keep thinking that Star Marine is a separate game, Arena Commander is a separate game. They are just facets of the overall game, the overall game is essentially what you get when you're flying around Crusader in 2.0/2.1, that we're going to be building on from and that idea was going to be sort of seamless between flying a spaceship, running around on foot whether you're running or just talking to someone.It's all from first person, it's why we call it first person universe. Travels massive distances, millions of kilometers, arrive at your location, get out of your ship, walk around, all going to be seamless. From now on most of the featured development iteration is really focused on the 2.1 sort of Crusader, we're actually shifting it, it's going to be... Crusader's just a small part but really it's the Stanton system. You'll be seeing that in the next, not necessarily 2.2 but 2.3/2.4 onwards, it will be fleshed out to be Stanton and we'll have those distances in there and you'll be able to travel around areas, then eventually go down and land on some of the locations.That is where the core gameplay is really going to be fleshed out because that is the PU experience, you behave quite differently in let's say Arena Commander and you will behave differently in Star Marine then you would in the proper Persistent Universe. Flying around, going from location to location, fighting people because obviously you respawn easily in Arena Commander and you get your ship back. In the real world, or the Persistent Universe, it's not going to be so easy, you're not going to be back in the action quite as well and you got to get your replacement ship and all the rest of the things.So, the whole idea of Arena Commander and the idea of Star Marine was really to sort of test out all the mechanics before we had all these things and been able to in one place but they're all in one place now so really where we want to be doing the mechanics is in the final destination, which is what the Persistent Universe will be. Now that doesn't mean that Arena Commander and when we turn on the Star Marine game mode, those two won't get love because we do understand that it is kinda nice to go in there and just practice your combat skills and don't have to deal with anything else or worry about getting your insurance ship back, reconfiguring your weapons to the way you liked it, flying back.You'll respawn/come to in a medical bay on the last friendly planet you made and that may be quite a distance away from where you died. We understand, Arena Commander you want some fast action, you want to get in there, you want to hone your dogfighting skills, you want to practice that. That's what that's good for, it's the same for Star Marine. That's all really about honing the FPS skills, exactly the same skills you'll be using in the Persistent Universe.That's why when I said last week when we were talking about it, it's no difference, it's FPS is what it is. I think I've seen all this noise about, 'oh, they've just thrown all this stuff out'. No we haven't thrown this stuff out, it's just that we don't want to bring all of the pieces online until they're all sort of... like the animation is properly polished and there's a bunch of little edge cases that had to be dealt with. You know the paradigm in development is, it's fairly easy to get 80% of the way there, it's the last 20% that takes 80% of the time and I would say that a lot of the FPS stuff probably would fall into that category.We just want to make sure that it works smoothly, so grenades and throwing it and gadgets, some of the other stuff we showed before when we did some of the demos is all still in there we just have it disabled at the moment. We need to make sure that they're polished and fully working well with all the other systems because when you're in the overall set up, you're not just doing FPS. We need to make sure it all works and plays well together.It's complicated, it takes more time but it's all happening there. So, the idea is Star Marine and Arena Commander will be both your sort of practice modes and yes, you can have some competitive games, where you might want to test your mettle against someone who's the best fighter pilot, who's the best on ground shooter, that's kind of what they'll be good for. Really they're just practicing for you existing in the Persistent Universe cause that's really where you need to have your skills.So, we'll tweak things, improve some of the game modes, at some point the matchmaking needs to be significantly improved and we'll sort of make all that be better but that's a lower priority to us. Building the PU structure out is sort of important and to be honest with you is actually super cool and super fun, that is an experience you don't get anywhere else where as yes, maybe I can just go dogfight in a bunch of other space sims or maybe I can run a gun in a bunch of other FPS games, but you can't do what you can do now in 2.0/2.1 in any other game.That's what's kinda cool about it. That's where our focus is, like I said Arena Commander, Star Marine, there's is sort of game modes, games within games to help you practice. They will be there and they will supported, they're less important than delivering the main experience which is what you're going to get in the Persistent Universe.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 76", "source": "https://youtu.be/GOyEcb5jJfE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Shrike", "published_at_timestamp": 1454367842}, {"objectID": "1cced81c063b6b_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "We're still working out many of the plans for post-launch, but the current idea is that the Reliant (and similarly priced 'tier 2' ships) would be part of slightly more expensive packages.

It was originally thought of as the only way to save and logout in space. Many thought it was a balance between the single seaters.", "answer": "Elwin Bachiller: Right now, that's where it is still at. You go out into space, hop into your little bed, go to sleep and that's how you can kind of log off in space and it might save your state out there. It's something that we still have to prototype and test to see if it actually makes it in as a game mechanic.So... I guess the answer to that question is... Maybe?Lance Powell: What about things that you're working on right now like the component swap?EB: Yeah, so components... ultimately what we'll want to do is build our components... which will include beds and sinks and toilets and bathrooms and things like that - build it so that we can just use them on every ship, or as many ships as possible so we can reuse the assets and that bakes in the ability to potentially customize the interiors. Now, do not take me at my word on that because the smaller ships are all basically custom interiors. You will not be able to swap out an Aurora bed for a Mustang bed for example, it's not gonna happen... but it might be possible in the future. We're kind of trying to build our assets to make that a possibility later on.Now, the other components such as fuel tanks, ammo boxes, powerplants, ballasts - like we have... I don't even know how many... in the 10s of different types of components which are all completely swappable across all ships of the same class. So, there's a little bit of that going on and all of those components definitely have heavy gameplay implications. For example, if you have an ammobox on one side of your ship that is now adding mass to one side of your ship. The handling of your ship is going to take a hit as a result of that. The avionics will still compensate in order to make it as unnoticeable as possible but the moment you start using the weapon and the weapon starts drawing ammo from the box, you start losing mass which changes the handling of your ship and every component, depending upon its location on the ship will affect the mass at that location which then changes the rotation speed. It affects the physics in a major way.

It is something that we talked about with the Cutlass variants, immediately following Cutlass-gate, as you might remember. The idea of making modular ships is both-... well, it's more fun for the community, right? 'Cause you can kind of buy one variant but then go find, or collect, or otherwise purchase the component parts to make it into another variant, mix and match, and it kinda allows for a lot of custom options. So the Cutlasses are undergoing that treatment from Foundry 42 right now. When we talk about larger ships like the Constellation, it's funny 'cause, well, I don't know that we'd actually talked about that, but that kind of the system that we're wanting to move to for a lot of the, umm... I called them \"sub-capital but bigger than a single-seat fighter\" kind of a ship - where they'll have larger interior spaces with form and function - so that as long as all of them subscribe to a similar layout on the interior space, we should theoretically be able to swap out different functional areas. So like, say if you have a med-bay that is a certain size and has this number of sleeping pods, maybe that's exchangeable for a bounty hunter holding cell area with similarly shaped logic there.

The Hornet has gone through quite a lot of changes, it looks a lot better, it has moved to PBR, it has higher res textures, more geometry added to it, and the same is also happening to the 300i, it has had a significant upgrade.And I think that we will be sort of following the car model where we will be occasionally upgrading the ships and also upgrading their performance and changing around the stuff, because I think it would be very cool to make it like cars where models change out and you can have a collector's edition or something like 1965 corvette was a classic and I love touring around in it.So yeah, I think that's very much in the spirit, and it's definitely something we're doing, so great question Traveling Matt.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 27.

Which, for us the profit's all extra money we put towards the game, so we like to have some things that, if we even sell physical goods, there's a bit of a profit in it so we can make a bigger, better game.We try to avoid to do physical items that are basically break even, because that requires a lot of man power and a lot of thought and a lot of juggling, and also customer service headaches 'cause, you know, did you get your package, did it get through customs, all the rest of the stuff.We have staff that do just deal with that, and obviously that's stuff that we could be spending money working on the game instead. So I don't know, but we're all geeks, and we all like the idea of cool spaceships, so we're kind of partial to potentially may trying to make some.So we'll see what happens there, but no promises yet.", "title": "10 for the Chairman Episode 19.

You'll be able to turn a much tighter turn because you're gonna be g limited.So your flight control system will essentially keep you inside the limits of what your body can take. If you're going very fast, and you try to pull a tight turn over a very short period of time, you'll experience a huge amount of g's and you'll black out. We're modeling g-lock, and all that kind of stuff. So that will be a reason not to fly at max velocity.Other reasons will be use of fuel, because when you're at max velocity, it's just like a car, you're not gonna be as efficient, and then we have wear on components, and we do model wear and upkeep.So you'll actually see your ship get grime and dirt and age over time as you play. You can take it into a planet and get it scrubbed up, but it will never be pristine showroom quality until you buy a new one. So it will be like a real car, which will be kind of cool I think.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 11 (2014.03.10)", "source": "https://youtu.be/ItuiYF_lRGc", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Krel", "published_at_timestamp": 1394491510}, {"objectID": "373686090", "question": "In the early Wing Commander games when we lost a wingman there was a short funeral sequence. Will there be something similar when it happens during SQ42.", "answer": "Yes, absolutely there will be. That was one of the best parts of the original Wing Commander and we sort of took it with Wing 2 had it in Wing 3, I think we had it in Wing 4. So we'll definitely have the funeral sequence. We couldn't have a Squadron 42 without it.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 04 (2014.01.10)", "source": "https://youtu.be/FsWDLHVYNHI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Akodo", "published_at_timestamp": 1389377198}]
