Ships currently have a second layer, extra UV sets, to show the damage it has taken if any (so the top layer gets eroded when damaged, revealing a texture underneath that gives it the \"damaged\" look\"). Players (armour) don't have that right now, because it would cost additional resources that are unaffordable. So the first thing they're looking into instead is to be able to see the status or type of a character from a glance. As part of this they've been talking about different types of suits and clothing that Players would wear, and to potentially theme them to different jobs. This would result in changing the stats of armour to fit different types, rather than having a situation where everyone where's similar or different armour, with similar stats. To elaborate, armour adds different things to a Player's stats, such as damage resistances (and perhaps other things like weight to slow the Player down by a certain degree depending on the armour). But this works quite similar to how the ships work, with the power triangle idea (so moving a stat in one direction reduces a stat in another, such as increasing armour might also increase weight). Ultimately, it depends on the suit in question and how it's been set-up regarding these stats. What's nice about the system is that they mix and match stuff, so Players can set-up their own custom profile to a degree, such as having an Explorer Undersuit with a Heavy Armour Core, which will be a different set-up than someone who goes full Heavy Armoured Marine. Armours and Suits might therefore be rethemed to fit types, so an Explorer type will be themed towards Exploration, which will be reflected in gameplay (so perhaps better climate control for the suit, or better protection from hazardous environments) - which is important so that Players can actually feel a difference in the gameplay, but also changing the looks should help Players \"read\" the different Armour/Suits easier. Whilst this won't help gauge another Player's health/damage state, it will help gauge what that Player is doing, or what activities that Player is geared up for (so if you met someone and they said they were a miner, but they were geared up for combat, you might be suspicious). This is more about being able to determine another Player's overall capabilities based upon what they're wearing. On a related note, they're doing a tonne of work around Actor States right now. The Actor Status system isn't just health, but all kinds of things like hunger, thirst, knockdown resistances etc. So a Player should be able to tell to a degree what another Player's status is from looking at them, but only generally speaking, and anything more specific would require Scanning. There is dirt and wear that will affect it, but really that just shows that the items equipped have been used. They'd like to have ship-like damage on the characters, but it's a problem with the UV2 channel which needs to be used for other things on characters, so it's just about a data-set not existing for it.", "published_at_timestamp": 1558137330}, {"objectID": "dc8390ad9313f_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "We don't have any current plans to allow players to dramatically alter the topography of their land.

So it's really a full seamless blend or running around on foot, flying ships, interacting with characters on the ship your based on or on other locations.So I don't think there will be an option to not participate in FPS but do the other things in SQ42, it's kind of a holistic experience.

That's absolutely going to be part of the gameplay.It's a long term, obviously not happening in 2.0 cause there's some more basic gameplay like cargo hauling those kinds of things, bounty hunting, mercenary escort missions.

Those are the guys directing the project so they pave the way for how we are supposed to prioritise our features. So they decide \"Okay we have an upcoming release, what do we want to show?\" And then once they decide what we want to show we'll break those features down into critical priority, high priority and moderate priority. And what that really means is that a critical feature is something that is an absolute must-have for that release; a high priority feature is a nice-to-have, it's something that's not essential but it's something that we would like to have in the release; and then a moderate is a wishlist item, so it's something if we get to it \"great\" if not \"no sweat\".So for example, for the first Social Module release we had ArcCorp, the environment itself, it was a pretty critical, must-have feature. Without ArcCorp there you wouldn't have had an environment to run around in: so it had to be there. That's a critical feature. We also had emote text descriptions, it was like a high feature. We wanted everyone to know when you did your emotes what was happening as you did them so the text would show up in the chat box. So that was a nice to have. And then moderate would be the critical, er, moderate would be the chat ...Jason Hutchins: Opposite of critical!JR: Oh so critical! Moderate would be the chat, additional extraneous chat features like the ability to minimise windows, customise chat just a little bit and that didn't end up making it in.JH: Stuff that we want to do eventually but we don't have to do right this second for this release.JR: Exactly, and then those features that don't make it into that release they'll either waterfall into the next release, sometimes at higher priority, sometimes not at higher priority depending on what Tony and Chris want to focus on; or they'll go into a backlog for later review.JH: A little peak behind the curtain too, we're trying to standardise what we are doing on the Production side, as far as using the same kind of nomenclature for features that we do for bugs, so we have critical bugs; high priority bugs; and moderate bugs. If it is a critical bug we're not going to ship a patch with it.JR: No.JH: Just like if it is a critical feature, or how that relates to task, we're not going to ship the patch without that being done. Also there is a focus shift to try and prioritise features going forward that are needed for both Persistent Universe and Squadron 42 and Star Citizen as a whole.

We do that internally as developers too, so we're seeing the FPS module all throughout its development cycle, so from the very beginning concept to prototype, then to testing and play-testing. I mean, we're going over it in detail multiple times a day at illfonic. You actually get player fatigue, the same way that a player does with any game, so you see what its missing that'd complete the experience. So one of the first things I did when I got out there was to look at options, so do we want to ship in x amount of time, here are the things we can or can't do. We do three of those options, and in this case we've decided to go to the maximum amount of fidelity at the cost of time. It's going to be really cool, though, and lots of things happen in the middle that affect it too, like we're going from Fmod to Wwise audio middle-ware etc. In making that transition, we have to re-setup all the audio. Then we have to bring the FPS branch back into the main branch's system, which has since had changes like lighting stuff, and ragdoll physics etc. We also have a new item-port system to work in. We'll have all of these features integrated when we move into main branch, which'll mean a much cooler release which will also come with AC updated etc, but it does take more time.

We haven't thought about paying more to fast-track it, it's a bit to early to say what would work and what wouldn't.

Is it the same nature of bottlenecks as a more \"normal\" game development process, or are there unforeseen challenges due to the way SC is funded?", "answer": "Travis Day: So this is actually a pretty good question - \"what resource other than time is bottlenecking us\" - and I would say it's... to answer it in a certain way... it's the gestation period. So there's always that analogy in production of-... especially on things like engineering tasks, right? Where you have so many people working in the same area it becomes less and less efficient, or they can't work in the same area physically, at the same time, on the same code base. We're seeing this a lot in our large world conversion. There's ways that you can break it up, but there are definitely ways in which one guy has to go through it all the way and it's more efficient to do it that way, so you always ask the question, like, is it one of those things where if you, say, have a woman who's pregnant and she will give birth in nine months, if you add nine more women is she going to have a baby in one month? And the answer is no. So a lot of these things, very similar to normal game development, just take a certain amount of time for somebody to go through it and do.In the nature of how SC is being funded being different, it actually.. it interestingly doesn't impact us that much. I would say the openness and the iterative nature with the community impacts us much more. The funding itself, I mean we approach this like building a game, right? So the community aspect and the community involvement part has a lot bigger effect than how we're funded - even though that is through the community. It is nice though to not have visits from... you'd call them the \"corporate suits\" or whatever... but the publisher, or notes from the publisher, or especially notes from the licensee who is giving you information on how you should respect their property - cause it's our property! So that makes it a lot more fun.Darian Vorlick: And it's one of those things that... and you mentioned the pregnancy... where there's a misperception that if we're running out of time, just hire more programmers, hire more artists to make it go faster - to kind of give a real world example on your 9 women pregnant...TD: We're probably the worst two people to talk about pregnant-... anyway...[laughter]DV: I'm expecting! [pats tummy] ... But yeah, there are some things where throwing more people or more money at it is just not the answer. And that's something that I think every game studio comes to that crossroad at some point where, \"do we need to hire more people, or is it just a matter of making sure people remain focused on the task at hand to just streamline the efficiency a little more?\"TD: Yeah, I mean actually you even see that in the time, if you've been following the project for a long time, with the initial studio in Austin being very small. It's very common in game development that at the early stages, having a bunch of people with a bunch of ideas - you know, the \"too many cooks\" thing is not going to help. So you kind of start small and then you grow and then once you get, \"okay, this is our plan for 'X'\"... Now, with our plan for 'X' we can have four parallel teams working on 'X' in these, like, very discreet swim lanes - now we can expand four-fold on 'X'.

So, uhh, long-term we're actually doing some procedural research and investing some money in a small group of people to look at doing all that kind of stuff. But we've got our work cut out for us in just building out the systems that we have, building out locations you can land on, building out the characters, the story... cos we're essentially building this universe and sketching it out in a pretty detailed level, and it does have some procedural elements, where building out certain locations are partly procedural and partly designed, but it's still a huge, huge, huge amount of work. So being able to fly down on any one of the planets and fly over them, and do all the rest of the stuff, will be super cool, but right now we're not ready to be able to do that. It's again one of those goals - once the game is out there on version 1, then those will be all the things we'll be looking about how we can actually create a planet... you know in these cases to be able to do it at this level you have to be able to create a planet mostly procedurally.Transition from atmospheres and planets, that's actually the least of the difficulties, and there's a bunch of pretty easy... you know, go down, go through the atmosphere and then \"boof\" and then you're down on the planet. But creating a planet big enough that you can fly over that has lots of interest, feels like, operates holistically, you know the different cities communicate with each other, they have their own businesses... doing all that is a huge amount of work, mainly cos of the level of detail we're simulating the world at.So that will not be a v1.0 goal, but it will definitely be a longer-term thing we'll try to work towards, because I do agree it would be very, very cool!", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 28.

There may be a case on some bigger, definitely on repairs and modifications there will definitely be some timeline stuff.You'll land in the ship, and your ship's shot up, then you'll go and say \"I need it repaired\" and they'll say \"Ok, it will get repaired, come back in 5 hours,\" or a day, which, when I say 5 hours or a day, I mean game time, so you can go out and then you can walk around the environments, do some stuff, maybe buy and sell some stuff, talk to people, and then go back to your ship and be ready to fly again.So we'll probably do it on some of the bigger things. Some of the simpler things like weapon loadout changing and stuff like that, maybe that's instant or very short.But we talked about having repairs and modifications. Like you're in the shop, and you can sort of see sparks and stuff happening in the distance while they're working on it, and then when it's finished, you could maybe get a notification on your mobiGlas.That's kind of how we're doing it, but like anything else, we're gonna fall on the side of what we think ultimately makes the game fun, so we definitely wouldn't want to make it too long doing that kind of stuff.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 25.

Claw marks on the old Wing Commander. So maybe we could mark-up a little PDF from each one of the manufacturers done up as a Hornet manual or Aurora manual.I'm not promising that, but I may after this recording session, go out and have a discussion of how easy it would be to do that.But, outside of that, the general control functions across the ships will be more or less the same. So the interface and how you fly it with a joystick or a gamepad or a mouse or a keyboard will all be fairly consistent. It's just that some of the ships will have more functionality than other ships. So you just won't have as much on a more basic ship than on a more advanced ship.In general, the control functions operate more or less the same especially on the fighters.
