It emerged after the altrucia was introduced to Hyperion (Fora III) by geoengineers in an attempt to create shelterbelts against dust storms. While most of the trees didn\u2019t survive the environment, the ones that did adapted, giving rise to plants that seemed dead until closer observation. Its pollen is used to make the illegal drug altruciatoxin.<br/><h1>Description and Life Cycle</h1><br/><p>In contrast to the leafy, colorful altrucia, the revenant tree has coarse, spiny leaves and is dusty brown in color. Its thick, dense bark prevents collected moisture from evaporating in Hyperion\u2019s heat and high winds. Most of its nutrients come from the soil. Because its environment is covered by thick dust clouds for the majority of the year, it goes through long periods of dormancy followed by fast growth phases when exposed to sunlight and water.</p><br/><p>Following the brief wet season, the revenant enters its reproductive cycle, directing all of its stored energy towards producing flowers sturdy enough to withstand storm-force winds. The flowers open in the morning and evening. Wind currents pick up the pollen and distribute it to other plants. Once it has been fertilized, the revenant flower becomes a cone and produces seeds that too can be carried by the wind when they reach maturity.</p><br/><h1>Houseplant</h1><br/><p>The revenant thrives as a houseplant. Since it grows well under low-light, low-moisture conditions, it can be raised in places that receive little sunlight, such as sealed colonies or spacecraft. If it is over-fertilized and overwatered, its roots may rot or the bark may split and open the inside of the tree to potential infections. For these reasons, a revenant tree is best kept in an ecosphere set to mimic the conditions on Hyperion and prevent overzealous care. Inside the ecosphere, it will go through its full lifecycle. However, it will not successfully reproduce unless it is removed from the ecosphere and purposely exposed to another revenant. Well-tended revenant trees can live for a century or more.</p><br/><h1>Uses</h1><br/><p>The revenant is cultivated for its pollen which, though illegal under UEE law, can be chemically processed into a prohibited substance called altruciatoxin. Also known as dust, candy, or round off, altruciatoxin is powdered and can be absorbed through the mucus membranes. Those who wish to experience a reduced high may smoke it instead. It causes sensory enhancement, muscular relaxation, and lethargy in its users. Though uncommon, usage of the drug can induce a violent and rarely deadly allergic reaction, especially in those who are already sensitive to pollen.</p><br/><p>Wild revenants can be used as a source of water. While the insides of the tree will induce vomiting if eaten raw, if passed through a fine-meshed sieve, the bitter liquid is safely drinkable by Humans and can hydrate in an emergency. </p>", "title": "Galactapedia: Revenant Tree", "id": "0Oa5AMlQAw", "slug": "revenant-tree", "template": "PlantAnimal", "type": "galactapedia"}, {"objectID": "3299ed714b8fc_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Banu Friendship Museum", "answer": "The Banu Friendship Museum was established in 2838 on a former United Empire of Earth (UEE) Navy base around Davien IV to commemorate Humanity\u2019s long relationship with the Banu.

then from that we discuss what loadout it should have What weapons it should have What size components it should have And then the ship gets concepted So we're in control of that  And then when we go through like concept of phase and the visual art style The art starts to lead some of where the ship goes as well So we've got like the purpose of the ship But then the look of the ship It needs to feel a certain way to match its kind of visual appearance And then we've got like a really good kind of matrix of like Where our current ships are Both in terms of the flight, the combat power  As we learn more about the game as well And how we move all the ships As we learn the systems more and more And improve the core features of the game We change the balance So we're moving all the ships together Then we look at where that ship should fit And we don't just want every ship to be the new best ship in the game That does everything the best There's always choices And that can be manufacturer based choices That can be visual kind of choices on the ship And where you put the thrusters Where you put the wings And how they look So it's really a lot of different factors That come into this And it's where we put the weapons It's where we put the turret Well if a ship doesn't have a turret It's where we put it And that defines how good that turret system is on that particular ship  And then there's just We've got kind of core numbers of health for example So we've got a really good idea of where the current ships are So we go right, well we want the ships for here So it requires this But it depends how the ship's built So the different parts on the ship And how the damages propagate throughout the ship So we have to work with all these factors  So yeah, that's kind of how we balance And then obviously we put We do do some testing internally To make sure the ship kind of fits What we originally set out it to be And make sure it fits in that particular area But it's not I don't like to say  This ship's just better than the Vanguard You know for example I like to go Well it could beat the Vanguard in this situation If you did this If you did this particular thing  And that's the difficult balance I guess Hopefully that's a good enough answer<br/><br/>Jared: Good answer  Now how do you build I'm going to follow up Because you did so well with that How do you do that  Knowing new systems are coming down the pipe Like master modes and resource management and stuff How do you take that delicate calculus You just described  And do something for the game today  But also leaving yourself room for tomorrow<br/><br/>Richard: Yeah I mean that's That's one of the really difficult things About doing this is We've got to think about the game now We've got to think about the game We're going to have for the next release But then we've also got to think about You know kind of really long term as well So we kind of  We kind of do the current game I mean you know We kind of have a base understanding Of where the current game is And where the ships are And we try and do our best to maintain that But also include a little bit of Future proofing ourself really that We don't have to go back and redo Every single ship in every single release for example So we'll try and move certain ships That's why sometimes probably You know we do get questions About certain ship balance not quite fitting But that's probably why Because it is a work in progress game You know this is a game where We can't just retune a hundred and something ships Every single you know release It's just not possible to do But we do try and keep it as one unit that's moving  And then we look at You know we look at things like master modes And stuff like that So what we try and do is We try and have these things in the game Now for us And we will balance the game For the future as well And then when it comes to it We can turn those systems on You know for the players Which is what we've done with the experimental modes You know we've got the Gladius there Well we did have the Gladius there And basically what we did was We just turned it on with master modes on And the tuning was there So we're kind of moving the game towards that For the future like that  But it is a very fragile piece sometimes And it is quite challenging There's days where you're like Oh my god I've got to throw all the balance out I've done over the last five years at this company You know for these new features and stuff Because we've got so much coming in the game And so much is going to change  But it's also really exciting Because it's a constant challenge as well So sometimes", "source": "https://youtu.be/6FVxbM8oeVA", "title": "Star Citizen Live: Ask the Devs - Vehicle Gameplay",

I was big on pushing for the creation of Horus as a system that had a planet that was tidally-locked to the red dwarf so there was life around the solar terminator.FS: Right.CH: Yeah.FS: Very cool.CH: I thought that was pretty cool. I just like so many things. I like nebulae and galaxies. I like black holes. I like the cool diamond planets that we've been finding that are kind of related to the stellar cores that I was discussing earlier. Oh man, I like that there ... our solar system as far as we know is very different from almost all the solar systems that we've seen. I love that we are in the young childhood of the exoplanet discovery planet ... exoplanet discovery phase of NASA, like Kepler is doing such a great job thousands of exoplanets have been discovered through the persistent efforts of a very, very few people. It's just a really wonderful time. I can't believe that the first exoplanet was only confirmed in like 1995. That's absurd. That's such a short time ago.FS: Yeah, it was.CH: We have so much left to discover. It's wonderful.FS: Yeah. So that's fantastic.CH: That was a bit tangential but thank you for asking me that question. It was really fun.FS: Alright. No thank you for the answer.

For instance, a tool to balance the ships and weapons. If it doesn't exist yet, are you planning to do it and with what approach?", "answer": "Randy Vasquez: So, actually this is a good one like we talked about with John Pritchett before, the cool story. John's actually been working on something, goal based tuning so that way it helps the designers input information into like a database, like a spreadsheet or something. All right, this is what we want the ship to do, then the system will extrapolate everything... all the information, kind of make it work with IFCS and everything like that and also kind of help the big ships... the Idris, the Javelin, all those also kind of work into it.Mark Abent: Yes, that is huge because his system is physically based so you needed to have actual proper physics, bunch of params, so designers are like, 'what does this one do'...RV: Basically.MA: It's like John has it all in his head...RV: I know, it's scary.MA: He has all these valuables he knows of and it's like, I just want to do this thing so he's making a nice ingame tool to say, give me what you want and we'll output those values.RV: I remember sitting down with John and I was like, 'John, explain this to me' and he was like, 'Ok'. So, he explained it to me and I'm just like... jaw dropped, eyes glassed over and he was like, 'too much?', mhmm. I love talking to him, it's funny, I'm like, 'oh my god, all this stuff you're putting into this is crazy'. So, he's been in the UK for the past week or two, actually this is the second week he's been in the UK, and he's been working on the goal based tuning system before that... before he goes out there to train like Andrew Nicholson on how to basically tune it for balancing and everything like that.So, it's been good for him to be out there so he can just sit down with the guys and be like, 'all right, this is'... because tuning a ship used to take a week or two sometimes. Depending on how complicated things were and how thrusters were working, now they have it down to a few hours. So, it's like a really big notable difference in balancing the ships now.MA: That too and it's like, you hit different problems and because we've done it so many times, John knows which problems they're going to be so he's able to make these tools to help designers fix it and do it quickly. So, he's got it down to science.RV: Yeah I know, he's pretty good at just setting the designers up too and figuring out what they need. I remember on the like the first ship I was starting to work on, he was like, 'ok, let's get this thing flight ready'. I'm like, 'ok'. Then he was talking about all the math and algorithms and trying to get the thrusters set up and I was trying to do the balance on the thrusters and I was like, 'oh my god, so much stuff'.MA: He has a lot of hopeful things that just show the visual things.RV: Sometimes you want to just take a straw and suck the knowledge out.MA: His stuff is more, I guess, inengine debug screen stuff that outputs things but we do have other tools like DataForge or even the thing like Ariel's working on...RV: Yeah, DataForge is a big help actually cause it's going to start really cleaning up from doing like hand XML stuff and if anyone does like hand scripting, so that it's like, if you have a tool it makes it so much easier to read and cleaner so that you can see where the issues are.MA: No more editing raw XMLs.RV: Going to be so awesome when it's done.MA: We also have Ariel's tool, the item port editor, which helps immensely cause you can see on the screen in game, your character and the ships and you can move/remove stuff and you can see it right then and there, and errors like, 'hey this can't fit there cause the size is wrong'.EV: He just seriously got the previous stuff set up too this past week or so. So it's really good, like Sean Tracy, Mark McCall and the new guy, Linc... he's actually going to be working with that tool and stuff so they've been giving him a lot of feedback. He's been working side by side with them and all the tools are just... tools are awesome. People that can generate tools to be useful and stuff will just save time so we can develop more faster, better, a little better.MA: If we don't have tools you can always just be Calix and write your own Python GUI system to do heat balance and yes he did do that.RV: He did. He did.MA: He was like, 'hey look...'RV: I'm prototyping this.MA: Ok.RV: Ok, at least he's not flow graphing it.MA: He did.RV: I know but it's like...flow graph.MA: He flow graphed the entire system and then once he figured out how he wanted it, then he made the GUI so he could explain it better to other people.RV: Yeah, cause the flow graph looked like spaghetti half the time.MA: Yeah.RV: I remember one time when he'd first done like the little thing for the... when you're sitting in the cockpit and you can interact with things and then he like showed you guys the flow graph and you and Paul were like, 'how does that work?' and he was like, 'I don't know, it just works'.MA: He gets prototypes working great but they're prototypes.RV: Remember trying to get his grabby hands stuff working in one of my levels and I was trying to mess with some of the cargo and some of the salvage and yeah... no, I was like, 'Calix, I don't understand this'.MA: It's like, yeah that ain't going to work, it's a prototype.", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 11", "source": "https://youtu.be/Qhx_0AIniws", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "OverTurn", "published_at_timestamp": 1464039966}, {"objectID": "373674310", "question": "I was curious about some aspects of gameplay with multi-crewed ships. Will the pilot be able to \"shutdown/restart\" individual engines while in flight? For example, if one was piloting a Constellation on a long exploration trip would it be possible to shutdown two of the main engines. Allowing the Constellation to cruise on the remaining two engines to conserve fuel, and then if needed the pilot could restart two cold engines to engage in the flight?", "answer": "Calix Reneau: Yes. That's the entire point of multicrew, taking the flight game and splitting it among multiple people encouraging teamwork. A consequence of that is that not everyone has access to all of a ship's systems, and not everyone NEEDS access to all of a ship's systems. That way a player has a lot more granularity/ability in an individual ship system. For example, with shields and radar, those controls will have a lot more ability to dig into exact what they're doing when they don't have to worry about weapons/targeting/not crashing.Matthew Sherman: If your shields get shot up, or your weapons do, we're going to have to give you some way of managing that within the ship, and yeah turning those systems off/turning off different engines, rerouting power etc, that'll all be possible.", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 08", "source": "https://youtu.be/j02lrXo3fXA", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Squirrel", "published_at_timestamp": 1462234019}, {"objectID": "373674680", "question": "As more Citizens try to join Port Olisar, the instances fill up and there's no space for additional players. Will there be more slots in the instances around Crusader in the future?", "answer": "So I'm assuming that whether we're talking about the actual instance itself, in terms of now the fact that we have 24 players and whether there's space for the ships or whether we're going to get above 24 players.So the answer is, yes, long-term we're absolutely going to have more than 24 players in any single instance, we will also open up some of the other spokes on Port Olisar, and there are actually 64 sleeping habitations in Port Olisar and basically arranged between 4 groups of 16 and 4 spokes and we're going to do connections between the spokes and add things like some shops and stuff on Port Olisar and by the way, Port Olisar is sort of a template of a sort of way-space-station that you'd kind of stop off, trade or repair your ship and stuff like that in the longer-term Persistent Universe.So we'll be fleshing out that, giving more functionality, giving more life and we'll make it more functional and have more players and in the mean-time we are working on backend stuff to be able to have more players happening in any one instance and also have players seamlessly go between instances &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; so the idea I've mentioned before on 10 for the Chairman is to sort of have a mesh of servers in the cloud that are dealing with one continuous space, say, the Stanton system where Crusader is based and then the different servers manage a certain group of players and if someone, say, travels from Port Olisar to Port Kareah and we've got more than the limit that one server can happen, say, right now 24 we would kind of have servers looking after the area around Port Kareah and servers looking after the area around Port Olisar and a server looking after the area around Covalex and as you move between these, you'd be handed off to the server that would be authoritative in that area but that server would still tell the other servers what your position is and what your state was.So any one server has a snapshot of all the entities or all the players in the system, but just only simulating the ones they are responsibility for. And that's a technique that we'll be able to increase the player count of the server, the other thing is increasing the efficiency of the code on the server and how it can utilize multiple cores, cause I think I've pointed out before, currently we run 8 dedicated game servers on one actual physical server in the cloud.A physical server has 32 logical cores, so it's about 16 actual physical CPU cores, and each one of our game servers &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; DGS instances &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; runs 4 logical cores, so two physical cores, and so if you just decided now we're not going to run 8 instances on this physical server, we're just going to run instance, there are then, you'd be 8*24 so that's a fairly decent number, right? Almost 200 players, and that's without even scaling, better optimizations and performance and stuff.Right, so, we are working on it, it's all stuff that's happening &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; it's kind of a bit of a trade-off because you can kind of see that what we're releasing you, like 2.2 and 2.3, sometimes performance goes down, sometimes performance goes up, and a lot of the problem is that we sort of add some new features and we don't really see the impact of the load until it's actually out on the PTU or even out Live. Because we don't, within our internal test environment, even with 30-odd testers, it's not enough to stress it in the same manner as thousands of testers doing PTU or hundreds of thousands when it goes fully live.So we're constantly working on that. We're working on optimizing code but we're actually in the middle of a massive backend rewrite &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; completely changing the way the serialization works to a much more efficient, logical way. Which is the item port- the item 2.0 system we've talked about, which we've recently got going. It is a fundamental part of that, because we're restructuring some of the way that entities are set up &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; so we're changing it completely from the way it was done in the old CryEngine to be a very component-based setup, much more logical, and we're only really serializing data that we need to serialize rather than big globs of data and it's not nearly as, I guess, fixed as the old system was. Because the old system was really built for small, 16 player or 8 player, multiplayer games  &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; deathmatch, FPS shooter-style whereas we've got something that we need to be up for long times, hours or days of time have the server up and have hundreds of people on it.So our ability to scale has been much bigger, it's something we've been working on for quite a long time, and we're still working on it, we're getting close to having some fruits of it being born in the near future. So this is very much analogous to us using, when we did the zone system and moving to 64-bit math instead of 32-bit math. All those things sort of paid off &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; what allowed us to be able to do Crusader and the local physical grids and all the cool stuff that you've seen from 2.0 onwards and a lot of this other backend stuff we're working on is going to make the experience much better, much smoother for you and have a higher framerate on the server &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; one of the reasons why people see desync issues now, and maybe some precision issues is the actual server when it's under load is running at actually quite a low framerate, even compared to clients.You could be on a client running at 40 or 50 frames, yet the server is only running at 10 or 15 frames. Now the server running at 10 or 15 frames is simulating physics only at 10 or 15 frames, which means there are big steps between each frame, whereas on your local machine, you've got much smaller steps, so what can happen is, on the server, you could be here &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; which is something that happened in the EVA situation &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; and the next frame of what the server thinks you're doing is, like you're player is half-way in the wall of the ship &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; he's moving outside. But on your local client, you haven't &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; because you have all the fidelity whereas on the server, it goes, \"oh look, he's half way in the world, so I'll give him a big impulse to try get him out\" whereas the server isn't in the same position which basically catapults your EVA person &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; could potentially kill him from the damage and that was one of the things that was creating, say, the deaths that you would see in an EVA-transition going in and out.And partly that was because the server on the physics step was running at a much slower framerate than the client so we're working on things to make all that better, it's a work-in-progress, it will take a little while to get going but once it does, it will be better and there will be a lot more people in the instances and we'll be moving smoothly. So these are all things that the network team is working on &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; I wish we had more members of the network team, we have essentially about 4 engineers that work on the game server network side and then we have another 3 that working in the backend services side. But if any of you out there are network engineers and wanna work on a really ambitious game, let us know, because we've had open positions for this for quite a while.We're always looking for good people because the things that we need is networkers, there's a big need for us on the engineering side, AI is a big need and physics &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; if there's any physics geniuses out there but if you talk to anyone in the game business, those are all the areas that are it's genuinely hard to find people. We're moving along and it's going to be pretty cool when it's all said and done, cause it's basically building a system, I've talked about it before, that the next generation of how you build these online cloud-driven systems, so we can distribute it across many servers and process more than you would in traditional single-server setups.So anyway, probably a long answer for whether or not there will be spaces for more additional pilot players, but there you go.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 81", "source": "https://youtu.be/n6g-ECx-7xw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Torian", "published_at_timestamp": 1459807296}, {"objectID": "373675120", "question": "Aside from shopkeepers, quest-givers, and other NPCs considered essential in other games, are NPCs in a given area going to be generated randomly based on the current environment and the parameters set in the area?", "answer": "So what's going to happen is that we have a universe simulation that runs on a separate server. That's much more of a big picture simulation. Think of it kind of like  a Civilization game or something like that. Sort of a slower turn based game. That actually is simulating the universe, what all the NPCs are doing, on a macro basis. Who's trading with what? What's producing what? What goods are needed where? Where pirates are attacking? The sort of general outcomes of those results are all happening on the universe simulation and it's own process. Then that is getting trickled down to the local game servers that all the players (i.e. you guys), are attaching to and playing in. The snapshot of what's happening on the universe server is sort of carried across the game server.What would happen is, for instance, if you were down on a planet it would say, \"Okay, well this planet is a mining planet and, you know, so I'll generate and the population is this size; therefore, we'll probably populate the landing area with 'X' number of NPCs, 60% of them will be miners, and then we'll have some, law enforcement, and you know we'll have some service workers in the bars and stuff like that.\" It will all be generated by the data that's pulled down, or pushed down, from the universe server, so it will dynamically change.If a place becomes... turns on hard luck times or whatever and there starts to be unemployment or people start moving off world to go somewhere else to seek jobs, and the population is lowered, then you'll see less people in the landing area. Perhaps the mine shuts down so then you won't really see miners anymore. Maybe the criminal element will increase because there's nothing to be done in that area where you can be gainfully employed so people are turning to crime.So what's gonna happen is there's going to be a loose, fuzzy, connection to what's happening on the universe simulation with what you actually see when you're moving around personally in the game. It will change with what happens in the universe. Of course what happens in the universe is influenced by what players also do in the game as well. So the AI meta actions are all handled on the server and then the player actions are simulated in those local game instances. Like for instance, you guys connect to Crusader right now, and results from that will be pushed back up to the universe server and then that will effect things like pirate count and some stuff like that.If there's pirates preying on a cargo run between two planets, say they're AI pirates, then the company that's not getting the goods because the pirates keep attacking its shipments hires some bounty hunters (i.e. you the players), to go after the pirates in the area or take them out. You do and you go and kill the pirates that are there, the 20 pirates or whatever, then that gets pushed back up to the universe simulator and the universe simulator says, \"Okay, let me kill the 20 pirates.\" If that kills all the pirates on the universe simulator, when you go back and fly that area back on the local game server instance, no longer will pirates be a potential spawning encounter because there's no pirates in that area anymore whereas before there were.So that's kinda how the connection happens between the game and the universe simulation and I think that it should be pretty cool and be pretty dynamic. So you will definitely feel impact from overall... macro movements and player influence. You should sort of feel places change with time depending on what's happening in the universe, so it should be cool.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 78", "source": "https://youtu.be/ciCNkp20O7w", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Narcoman", "published_at_timestamp": 1457391427}, {"objectID": "373679630", "question": "Will players be able to play as privateers/corsairs/buccaneers, on the grey-but-still-legal side of the law and carrying letters of marque like Sirs Francis Drake and Henry Morgan?

So the British would be like \"Oh ok Sir Francis Drake, it's ok if you sink Spanish ships you can't sink English ships you can only sink Spanish ships\". So i'm not sure we have exactly the same situation here cause the UEC is, I don't think the UEC is going to be \"Well it's ok to sink ships from Terra but don't sink ships from Earth.\" So i'm not so sure about The Letters of Marque but there will definitely be cases where, as a freelancer you will be hired by various orgs, NPC orgs or UEE or whatever and you'll do sort of missions for these greater powers or organisations.It's a little bit like The Letters of Marque and I definitely think there's going to be gameplay that will allow you to be a privateer or a corsair buccaneer so maybe there's a grey area between Earth and I don't know the Xi'an Empire or something like that.

We're doing the demo, we're doing the play test and then someone comes up to me and they're like, 'you know, the characters are kinda cool and all but when I was doing the EVAing, my neck was kinda like, you know'...OA: And we're like, that is a design choice.FS: We're out there in space, and I was like, 'is that a problem?' Would that be a thing?' So actually, currently we got that fixed so actually it kinda has some black rubber that protects you. But you brought up a good point a week ago when you were talking about having a type of, you know, attachment or some kind of...OA: Right.FS: Bridge between the helmet and the suits that's kinda modular. That way you can take the suit helmets on and off and they actually do kinda cover...that was just one of those things that you don't really think about until you're in space and all of the sudden your neck is exposed... that's not right. That's gotta hurt.OA: Yeah, it's hard too because when you first design a character sometimes when we're doing the marines, they're going to be fighting indoors. So, we kinda designed them for a situation like that and then as design goes on they're like, 'you know what would be really great, now these guys are going to launch into space or now the hull's going to be breached'. So, as design throws things at us, that's when we start to come back and fact check our characters. Between like, now we know that all the marines pretty much or all the combat soldiers or essentially going to have to be EVA capable at some point, to some extent, or at least survive in...FS: That loops us back to the first question which is, that's when we go back into the vault... and we re-evaluate the concept, we figure out do we need to go back to concept stage and make some adjustments, can we make them on the fly, like Omar did with the jetpack for the GamesCom demo... is it a temporary solution, is it a permanent solution.So, we go back see what we can do and then all of the sudden we have the necks clamped and we have the jetpacks. Then we learn from it, so then that's the next iteration, is we say, okay now when we're doing the concept for the EVA jetpack that Jeremiah's working on, we know the way the thrusters need to be set up now. Which means they're going to take that into account so they're going to be even better than the last version.OA: Exactly.FS: As we're fleshing this out, because we are in pre-production, we are still learning how the game mechanics are going to work. So, that's just a very organic iterative process.OA: Right. I think it's difficult too because one thing is just that, so concept would have to know that all these marines would have to be EVA capable yet they don't know when they're drawing it that it does, because you don't know it until it's built and it's in game. Then you see, that ok, this is a problem but that's something that needs to be designed. Once that happens, then we can go back to concept and say, 'All collars, there needs to be some sorta collar or connecting point'. Then they'll concept it, when we get to the game... the guy who's modeling the character, he needs to know here's where the geometry goes, here's where it connects. The concept is now built off this one point...FS: Yeah exactly.OA: But there needs to be a whole bunch of things to occur for us to notice and to develop it.FS: You need the suit to support it so it snaps in, you need the helmet to support it, then you need all the modular pieces of the suit to support it. So, it's a thing...OA: Yeah, especially ones like modular, flying through space. It gets...FS: Why do we have to do space, you just have to support everything. Just the way it is.OA: Space and land and sea...FS: [laugh]OA: I'm not saying that sea though, I'm not announcing...FS: You just did that.OA: No submarines.FS: No sea. No planets of water, please... actually that would be pretty easy.OA: That was a good question though.FS: Do Waterworld with Kevin Costner.OA: Really? We're going to do Waterworld?FS: No.OA: Announcing two thousand and... just kidding.FS: Not true. That would be awesome. Some modders out there do that.

We were having difficulty recently with things with very high reflectance, they're harder to minimize the amount of aliasing. So, you get a lot of alien issues with super reflective materials.FS: You said alien issues.OA: Aliasing issues.FS: But it's appropriate. It's Star Citizen.OA: We have tons of alien issues. But yeah, that kind of tech, when we were doing it, so like... a little small pieces on a guy, it'll either, you'll see him far away and it'll start sizzling, or what if we make it more like a painted, like a military metal, it's not going to alias, and is that really piece of chrome, is that really adding to it? Probably not. But with a ship..FS: The shinier it gets, the worse it looks in the engine, sometimes, without proper, with the aliasing that we have in real time, it's kind of difficult. I have a trivia question. We know what the most reflective material is. What is the least reflective type of surface or object in real life?OA: Are you asking...FS: I'm asking you. Do you guys know this question?OA: The least reflective material? I'd assume a black hole would be the leastFS: A black hole? It's a thing, you can hold it in your hand.OA: You can hold it in your hand...FS: If you're bad, you get it...OA: CoalFS: That's right.OA: O...kay. Interesting.FS: I don't know if that's true or not, but I'm pretty sure it is. I think it is. It is in the game.OA: Coal is the last reflective?FS: Pretty sure. Yeah, no, it is.OA: If you're wrong, they're just going to make fun of you. The're going to be 'it's actually this super high-tech polyurethane that doens't reflect'FS: No.OA: It absorbs all light.FS: In our documentation it says it is. That I wrote.OA: Okay. Great. I hope it's right! But a fully chrome ship? I don't know... I meanFS: Like Ryan Church's ship in Cosmos?OA: I don't know. As a designer, I wouldn't think that was cool, but...FS: Did you just say Ryan Church's ship is ugly? It's awesome.OA: No, I'm not saying his ship isn't cool, don't blame me! I'm playing like GTA or something, and they have that chrome option, and...FS: You have an email in your inbox right now.OA: Oh, jeeze, I'm fired.FS: Is this live?OA: Yeah, but, we could, it'd be a sizzly ship...FS: I wouldn't do it.OA: I wouldn't do it either. Just for... I guess. You could. But it wouldn't be the best.

We're going to have all of the... all of the mass that you bring into your ship is going to affect your center of mass. Even further than fuel and ore and all of the cargo stuff that you'll have, because your ballistics and your ballistic ammo... all of this stuff adds up to affect your flight performance, your missiles, and you will not be flying the same at the end of a battle as you are at the beginning. IFCS does a lot to try and make up for that, so it doesn't just become an instant slugfest. The basic notion is that there would be really poor handling, because even without IFCS compensating for it, fairly slight changes in center of mass have had pretty big effects on handling. It is very noticeable any time our center of mass is wrong... as you probably actually experienced. That happened to the Mustang and the 300 series and we definitely heard about that. So, yeah it will be taken into account and we will be providing tools to overcome it and as you take damage or make silly choices, because I'm always in favour of accommodating the silly choice, that will inhibit your ability to do things.", "published_at_timestamp": 1433800772, "question": "With everything going to a math-based system like the damage modeling and thruster input can we expect the same when it comes to ore and fuel as far as volumetric handling?", "source": "https://youtu.be/TLE_cqaY1iI", "title": "10 for the Designers: Episode 04 (2015.06.08)", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "GeraldEvans", "time": "8m48s"}, {"objectID": "373682780", "question": "If you run out of ammo or lose your weapon for any reason, would it be possible to use bits of debris as a melee weapon, i.e. splintered box pieces or broken beams, or a severed arm or leg from our enemy or friends?", "answer": "Travis Day: Some guy dies, you take his leg, beat your enemy with it?Ricky Jutley: Something like that. I believe name I don't know did that as a fatality in Mortal Kombat 4, so...Yeah, maybe some reference to that. Good game.We could do something like that, but I think just having an item that you could just pick up around the level, or any kind of item that the players are able to interact with may be difficult to maintain, because pretty much any part of the geometry of the world would be rippable, and I just think the player holding many different items or anything they can grab would be difficult to do.TD: Yeah, it would be a difficult thing to do. A lot of people saw the system with grabby hands and they thought, oh, you can just pick up anything and use it as a weapon, but once you start using those things in the Universe, and using them to react especially with other players, especially in a fatal way, it becomes much harder to maintain, much harder to test and balance. So, maybe that's something we could do in the future, probably not in the near term.RJ: We'll probably have like, one prop that's a dead guy on the floor, and that's the one prop that you can rip arms and legs offTD: Just for you, just for you.RJ: Good question.", "title": "10 For the Producers Episode 07", "source": "https://youtu.be/_4Ml0-EedyU", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Gravymonkey35", "published_at_timestamp": 1432581761}, {"objectID": "161884f65bbff4_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The only limitations will be those introduced by equipment sizing; the Gemini can mount larger guns, shields and engines which can't transfer back to the standard model.

Will we need a Space Traffic Controller authorization to land with a specific circuit? How will it be enforced (prohibited to land on a planet if we didn't comply or space pilot license revoked)?

You'll still be able to look around, walk around your ship... but it will bring you into your landing spot on the pad, and then once you get there, you get out. So you will not be able to sort of just bully and barge your way into a planet uninvited basically. Whether a spaceport can be closed due to a lot of traffic, I don't know. The bigger planets, probably not, because we can instance obviously, so a lot of people will be coming and going. And I think there will be a certain amount of enforcing if you try to get to close to a planet - whether you'll sort of burn up in the atmosphere, or the local police will shoot you to say you got too close.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 37 (2014.09.15)", "source": "https://youtu.be/HJnqq7DX68A", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Qanniqtuq", "published_at_timestamp": 1410816374}, {"objectID": "373683220", "question": "My guild mates and I were wondering if the shield on the ships are a physical barrier, or could you possibly as an example, fly a small fighter insider a larger ships shields to put direct fire onto its hull effectively bypassing the shields?", "answer": "That's a good question. So the way the shields work on all our ships is, the shields are actually separate collision geometry that is further out from the actual collision geometry that defines where you would hit the actual hull of the ship. And the concept is that the shields are really meant to absorb energy, so if I'm firing an energy bolt, it'll take that and dissipate it round the shields, and ballistic weapons actually penetrate through shields, but they do have some of their energy sapped away. So therefore if you've got really strong shields you can reduce the kinetic energy on the hit of the shield. They're not really built to prevent or save you from hitting an asteroid, or a head-to-head collision with another ship, because the idea is the shields will always stop things at a certain kinetic velocity or energy or whatever.So it definitely would be a case I would think, that you could fly a ship through - assuming the AA of the ship aren't firing at you - through a bigger ship's shields and maybe be on the inside of it, and shoot. So once you're inside that shield proxy, obviously your bullets won't get stopped by the shield proxy - they'll only get stopped by the hull proxy. So yes, it is possible to, as long as the shields have enough room between them and the hull, to do what is suggested by Acebravo.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 31 (2014.07.28)", "source": "https://youtu.be/QWWhhg56IoM", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Acebravo", "published_at_timestamp": 1406584832}, {"objectID": "373683590", "question": "What kind of peripheral support can we expect to see in the first iteration of the Dogfighting Module?Specifically, are there plans to integrate TrackIR into the first version?", "answer": "So TrackIR probably will not be on the first release of the Dogfighting Module, but Oculus Rift may be.But that is sort of dependent on CryTek because they're doing some work to fix the lag issues we have. We have an implementation and we're using it, but it's a bit too laggy to be useful. If they fix those implementations, then there will be a certain level of Oculus Rift, but that would be a later focus.Right now we just want to get the Dogfighting v1 out so everyone can use it.
