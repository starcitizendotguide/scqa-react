[{"objectID": "bo1xJPgMNL-yela-stanton-2c", "answer": "<h1>YELA (STANTON 2C)</h1><br/><p>Yela is the outermost natural satellite of Crusader (Stanton II), and is orbited by a ring of asteroids. A thin crust of water-ice on the moon's surface is said to represent the cool demeanor of Yela, the oldest sibling in the Human children's story A Gift for Baba, after whom the moon was named. Crusader Industries security came under fire during a Senate hearing in SEY 2949 for failing to curtail criminal activity in the outpost colloquially known as Jumptown, located inside one of Yela's craters. </p><br/><h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1><br/><p>Due to its thin oxygen atmosphere and distance from the system's sun, the surface of Yela is very cold, with average temperatures ranging between -55 \u00b0C and -10 \u00b0C. The large water ice sheets that sprawl across the plains and mountains feed the water cycle via sublimation. There are no bodies of liquid water on Yela's surface, nor is there any rainfall, but snow showers, fog, and windstorms can arise when the weather conditions are correct.</p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>Discovered by navjumper Toshi Aaron alongside the rest of the Stanton system in 2851, Yela was briefly the sole property of the United Empire of Earth (UEE). During this time, the UEE Navy began to construct a base in the skies of Stanton II. It lightly mined the moons for resources, but largely left them alone. </p><br/><p>In 2865, driven by a financial crisis, the UEE sold all the planets and moons in the system to various corporations, including Crusader Industries, who purchased the parent planet along with Yela and its sister moons. After refitting the Navy's platforms on the newly-renamed planet Crusader for its own use, the company established multiple mining facilities and security outposts across Yela, Cellin (Stanton 2a), and Daymar (Stanton 2b), and offered some of the land for lease.</p><br/><p>In spite of the inhospitable environment, some Humans have made Yela their home. Wilma Ivery built the first permanent homestead in 2907, where she lived until her death in 2935 from natural causes. In 2909, the first Human was born on Yela when Albert and Nora Triolo were forced to make an emergency landing to give birth to their daughter, Erma Triolo. Outlaw group Nine Tails began using abandoned Navy facilities as bases in 2946, leading to an increase in patrols from Crusader Security.</p><br/><h1>CULTURE</h1><br/><p>Unregulated ground-vehicle racing is a popular pastime among residents of and visitors to Yela. Lakedra Walsh organized and won the first recorded ground-vehicle race on the moon in 2912. The site of this race was made into a permanent racetrack, and was named Lakedra's Lap in her honor. Many of the racing sites take advantage of Yela's terrain, and include large boulders and rocks. In 2917, amateur racer Ethan Halton died in Nakamura Valley from injuries sustained during a crash while making a tight turn on one such track.", "id": "bo1xJPgMNL", "question": "What is Yela (Stanton 2c)?", "slug": "yela-stanton-2c", "template": "PlanetMoonSpaceStationPlatform", "title": "Galactapedia: Yela (Stanton 2c)", "type": "galactapedia", "published_at": "2024-10-25", "published_at_timestamp": 1729823822}, {"objectID": "bBzvN8LL4m-vagabond-system", "answer": "The Vagabond system (designated VS-07 by the United Empire of Earth (UEE)) is a Vanduul-controlled planetary system that shares no publicly-known jump points with any other systems.

You would venture round, you would go to the castle and kill the evil demon and everyone else was going to the same castle, killing the same evil demon and it didn't feel like it was a real world as much.So one of the big goals with Star Citizen was to try, and we're still obviously working pretty hard on this 'cause we're not there yet but to build a world that's more emergent, more dynamic and feels like it's got persistent places, locations, characters and you felt like you could be part of the fabric of it and your actions potentially could have some impact on how the world, or the story universe unfolds during your playtime and I felt like i'm not really seeing the bigger online games being able to do that.There's elements, EvE actually on its side actually has some really nice stuff in terms of allowing the players themselves to generate a lot of the drama and therefore the content for the game and that definitely is partly an inspiration that happens in Star Citizen just in terms of making it player centric. So not necessarily of all the EvE mechanics but I do think it's really good to have your playerbase generate a lot of potential action and drama and missions. You can even see it right now in 2.1 if you're flying around even though we don't have that much stuff going on and there's some basic missions, players themselves are almost creating missions out of nothing. \"Oh look i'm stuck out here at Port Kareah can someone come and rescue me and take me back to Port Olisar?\". That kind of stuff is great because the actual actions of the players cause other, can cause other things or other players to respond to them in certain ways or do certain things.So very much the focus of the structure of the Star Citizen Persistent Universe is how to push that, how to get people to play together and do things together or how they could be in potential opposition or in opposition to NPC's and their actions will cause reactions. I think doing that will create a much more dynamic universe and something I think that we won't be overwhelmed with trying to provide content for.We can never keep up building new scripted content to keep up with the demand of how quickly people can play through the content. I think that's the lesson you'll see if you look at World of Warcraft. The new expansion comes out everyone re-ups and now they're back up to ten million people playing it, they blast through all the content and bam it's back down to seven million or six million people playing it. You see that as a pattern in the more, the older school MMO's. I don't think you really see as much of a pattern in EvE which is a bit more dynamic. That definitely is one of the fundamental ideas in goals.In terms of play style I definitely like you to earn the rewards you want in the game. So if you think of Demon Souls, i'm going to use this as an example. That's a pretty unforgiving game but when you actually achieve something you really feel like you achieved something because it was hard to get there and you risked a lot when you got there. I think that's another longer term goal that I want to make sure is for Star Citizen you don't feel like everything's just given to you and everything's easy. You feel like if you're going out to earn some money on a dangerous mission you can earn some really good money but also you're really risking a lot when you do that. I think that combination of that really works well with this reactive sandbox design . To some extent DayZ had a bit of that where you died, you died, you lost everything. So people really were,  It's the emergent player behaviour that came from that was fairly interesting. I'm not sure it would necessarily is going to be anywhere close to as harsh as that but it definitely highlighted the fact that, the advantages you can get from permadeath in terms of people feeling invested in what they worked for.So all those things have bubbled together into what I want to do with Star Citizen and I also want to make sure  the world feels alive. Which is why we have this ninety-ten rule of AI NPC's to players is yes I want you to play with your friends, I want you to engage or interact with other players but we need a living universe you can't be one hundred percent dependant on other players to provide that. so having ninety percent of your population be AI means that as you move around this universe there are traders going about their trade runs no matter what, pirates doing pirates no matter what, mercenaries protecting people or escort missions, or bounty hunters going after people. Miners mining, explorers exploring all this is happening like it would in the real world.No matter what the playerbase itself is doing. The player base can influence what say these NPC groups do but you feel like you're in a live world and the NPC's will react to you and depending on what you do in the same way that maybe the players will and I think putting all that together hopefully will create a dynamic universe that will just feel more alive and more real a lot of the past online games. We'll see we're not quite there. I'm pretty encouraged by just the feeling of running around in 2.0 and 2.1 and seeing what players are doing and seeing where it is when we've got such a basic barebones in there.So I know with all these extra things we're going to layer it in with the detail and fidelity we're going to do it's going to be an experience  like no other one. I hope anyway! That's goal it feels actually pretty good. We've got a lot of things to do obviously along the way and to make things like the user experience more friendly and welcoming to the new player but also make sure keep the challenge and depth that the more experienced players and so these are all things i've talked about before and that we're working on and that was a very long answer for this question but it was a pretty open ended question!", "published_at": "2016-02-01", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 76", "source": "https://youtu.be/GOyEcb5jJfE", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Sansight", "published_at_timestamp": 1454367842}, {"objectID": "373682920", "answer": "Eric Kieron Davis: So we've kind of touched on this a little bit on the other sections but this is something that we're actually thinking about. Quite a bit actually. Customisation is a big part of a good Persistant Universe. I don't think really as we get more things online and we get more clothing styles going, I don't know if there's been a determination for more or less based on gender.Forrest Stephan: It's just going to be the same. All about equal. Equality.  The same amount of female clothesEKD: Well then how about aliens? Any of that equality?FS: That's another fine question. Sure of course I mean.EKD: All equal. The thing about all that stuff you know exactly eye shape and all those things based on characters you're going to get and things like thatFS: That's something that's still in the RnD phase is how to customise characters in regards to the actual hair, eyes, face, body shape. Currently what we're doing is we do have multiple hair styles that you're going to be able to start swapping through. We have a shader that actually allows you to change the eye colour dynamically.So instead of us having a texture maps and it's a lot of labour for the eye colour. Currently we made nine different eye colours that are all shader driven. That you can cycle through even though it's not coming online in the very near future it will be. Then it also allows us to create even more with that. Too much effort other than making sure that we officially are on it.EKD: Totally.

Basically we'd picked that and there was a few others, like Terra and a couple of other ones.I think maybe when we were first doing it, we thought Stanton would be a good system because it has quite a few different planets you can go visit. They all have their own different identities and there will be quite a lot to do even if you just had gameplay in just one system. We could have the Stanton system detailed out to the level of fidelity we want to do, run around and that would absolutely be equivalent to most games, if not more that most games, out there.

Most systems will have lots of opportunities for mineral mining, like asteroid fields, and many such fields won't even be marked on maps.So there will be a whole Explorer/Prospector Career path where you're going around flying around in empty space looking for asteroid fields, and then scanning them to see if they've got minerals, and then maybe laying a claim to a certain area to file that in the UEE at the 'Office of Mineral Rights' (or whatever we're calling it in the UE Empire).Right now, as Tony and I talk about it, we're gonna have it so that the fields don't regenerate, but longer term, we may do it because we don't wanna drive everyone out of the center systems once it's mined out.

I mean, I think that-Will Weissbaum: I was gonna say \"maybe\" ... [chuckles]DH: Yeah, I mean the thing is, it's important to remember, as long as it's not-... there's a weird thing with humor - I've always looked at it as, it's great to have funny people in it because you can have funny people in a serious environment. Hudson from Aliens is always my classic go-to example - like, he's a funny character who's in a very serious situation and he takes the seriousness of the situation seriously, but he reacts to it in a funny way because he has a dynamic personality. But yeah, I think you need that, you know. I was actually talking with Chris about this last week. He was like, \"if you have too much-... if it's too monotone and too dark, and angry, and violent the entire time, it gets overwhelming and it feels flat. You need this levity to kind of punctuate the darkness.\" And you know, that's one of the great things about Firefly too - that's a show that can get very dark and get really violent, and part of it is because you have that warmth of the comedy to counterbalance it, so when it gets dark it feels really dark and really bleak, 'cause you have these big personalities who are scared.WW: Yeah. And I think I try not to - when I'm writing a lighter, funnier moment - not to have the characters poke holes in the world, or make fun of the world, but rather have the humor come from a place with inside the story, and evolve out of that. 'Cause you know, it can be an easy joke sometimes - one of the more obvious ones would be, \"isn't it stupid that we're doing this,\" \"isn't it stupid that I have to go get this box,\" but then you're just kind of shooting yourself in the foot rather than trying to build up to something.But yeah, one of your wingmen will just have a horn that he honks as you're flying around!DH: Heheh, yeah... he's got really big shoes...WW: Actually I kinda really like that... like a Harpo as a wingman...DH: Like, \"cover my six! meep meep meep!\" ... \"I got your back! meep!\"WW: \"Oh no!

In fact it's less so much your helmet, that's more a display, but the equipment you're carrying dictates what you see in your HUD, much the same way that the equipment you have on board your spaceship will dictate what you can see there as well. The model we're driving towards is you plug different systems in (armour/smart weapons etc). Currently in AC everyone has the same HUD, but in 1.0 (or shortly afterwards) the different ships will have different HUDs, like the Aurora will have a more simple/basic HUD than a more sophisticated combat ship. Auroras might be able to track just one target while the Hornet might track 4. But you can upgrade your radar package etc etc to augment that. Longer term it'll have everything to do with your upgrades that you apply to your ship, but it'll apply to FPS as well.

I mean essentially if your ship is damaged, you'll bring it down to the repair shop on a planet, and then it will cost so much money to repair it.I think we discussed to a certain level that there potentially would be a case where you could take a loan out to fix things or do stuff on your ship if you don't have enough money for it, and then at some point you wouldn't be able to get any more, and if you still don't pay that off, people come after you to get it from you. Then at that point, you may not be able to fly your ship, but perhaps you can take a job being a pilot for someone else, or doing some mundane job for someone else to earn enough money to go and fix you ship, which is kind of what you would do in the real world.So that's our thinking as far as that goes.", "published_at": "2014-06-30", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 27.

I would say that in general, it depends on the kind of ships, but it's always good probably to have, if you can, store it and have more than one ship. Because the ships are very role specific, so if you want to be trading, that's a very different ship than you will need to be flying than if you want to be a mercenary and just doing dogfighting. Because there isn't really a ship that's the jack of all trades that does everything.Yes, there are some ships that you can take cargo and dogfight on, but if you want to really haul cargo, then you'd probably want to be flying things like the Freelancer or the Starfarer, and obviously they aren't necessarily the best dogfighting ships out there. But if you want to trade it in, say you were upgrading to a bigger cargo ship or a better dogfighter, then yeah, the game will allow you to trade it in just like you would normally now if you were getting a car.And we are going to have second hand ships that will probably be in the universe, in our Persistent Universe, on some of the planets, we already have the equivalent of a used car dealership in some places, and that would be a place to get ships that would be second hand, used, worn down a bit, maybe not quite as pristine or efficient as what you'd buy on a new show room floor, in game just like in the real world.And I would assume that some that get traded in get put down to scrap metal because there's only gonna be so much inventory we want to keep out in the persistent universe.", "published_at": "2014-05-05", "title": "10 for the Chairman Episode 19.

'Cause I've had some people say \"I want to know more about how the game's getting made,\" and that's cool, because we want to tell you about how the game's getting made, but we actually are very deliberately spoon feeding out the world and creating the universe with our fiction.Like we have an update on Tuesday, we have an update on Thursday, we're actually using it as an in-fiction way of revealing things, ideas, concepts, and intentions that we want to have in the universe, and also in some cases player mechanics.So we've had pieces where we talk about the trucker show, then we talk about the mechanics, or piracy. So the idea of some of the pieces is to, in an in-fiction way, highlight what we think some of the game mechanics are.So I would say that it's probably a good idea to read those, even if you feel like it's a lot of text.Anyway, back onto the point.David: Yeah, one of the things we talked about was having elections basically. The senators that you're reading about now have to run for office again. So we would write up these characters for them to run against, do ads, say what is their belief platform, and all those sorts of things, then let the players vote for who they want to have in office.That would be a fun way for the community to throw us a curve ball, 'cause if we write up a character who, internally, we say is going to become a despot if they elect him, and you guys elect him, we have to accommodate for it.Chris: Like live storytelling, right, so one of our goals is that, once the game is live, we want a lot of the player actions to shape how it goes.We've got a general, big, overall plan, which is inspired by the decline and fall of the Roman empire, but there's a lot of directions it can go inside that large framework that we want to have player-fed. So this is a great example where you have the citizens vote on a senator, and then if they vote for a particularly aggressive, militant, senator--David: Right, or isolationist or something else.Chris: It would effect how we would start to update the content after that. And there's other things we're gonna do.So if there's a battle involving two big groups of players, we're essentially gonna have, think of it as a game master who plays a reporter role. We're actually gonna have some people who's jobs are, when the Persistent Universe is live, to go around recording stuff, then we collect news around the universe and if you go into a bar, they'll be playing it:\"Off in the Vega sector, the Terran Federation got into a brawl with the Goonwrathi,\"and there's a report. So hopefully if you're playing the game, you'll feel like your actions actually start to become part of lore. It's all part of the whole idea of \"Death of a Spaceman\" where you've actually got a timeline, our spaceships themselves get wear and tear, the characters get wear and tear, time passes, things change in politics, players effect it.That's all part of the spirit of how we think the universe itself will be, a really fun, cool place. And we're kind of excited because, I mean this is a ways away, 'cause we've obviously got a lot of other things to do before we get to this final state where the full game is all fully done, but we're pretty excited about getting to that point and just seeing what happens. Already just what we see evolve on the forums, on the web, is more than we would have guessed. The Alliances, the groups, and all that kind of stuff.David: Right, well it will be kind of fun 'cause for the average player, it blurs the line and makes it difficult to discern what of what is generated by CIG and what we generated by other players.Chris: Yeah, I think it will be great. It's almost like we will be editorial for player generated content. Which in some ways is also what we're doing with The Next Great Starship. That is gonna be user generated content that is editorialized. We say we think this is good enough to go in the game, we help guide it. I think that will be hopefully a lot of fun when we get to do that, but until then, we've still got a bunch of other things to do.", "published_at": "2014-03-10", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 11 (2014.03.10)", "source": "https://youtu.be/ItuiYF_lRGc", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Idolo", "time": "1m25s", "published_at_timestamp": 1394491510}, {"objectID": "373686160", "question": "I was wondering whether the Dogfighting Module will be released with a finalized flight model.
