They totally dig the community they're just not fans of being on camera. So I asked one of our tech directors, Mr Carsten Wenzel, and he actually wrote me up some stuff so I'm going to sit here and actually read this so if I'm not looking at the camera I am reading it from paper. So his response ...\"We're actively looking to adopt the new graphics APIs. As you know DX12 and Vulcan differ quite significantly from previous API designs such as DX11 and OpenGL 4.5. They try to map very closely to current graphics hardware architecture, as well as provide applications more low level control of video memory. In order to take advantage, full advantage of them we started a massive refactor of the renderer and 3D engine in order more efficiently prepare and submit items to be drawn, well beyond the scope of the massively instanced rendering optimisation done by us.\"\"Think of a departure from a monolithic render thread to more lightweight jobs that prepare individual render passes in parallel via the job system. The hope is this will allow us more flexibility in terms of draw calls in a lot of areas without complicated runtime merging of materials and meshes, or tedious offline optimisation passes on the content creation side, for example, such as character attachments.\"\"This refactor will lay the foundation for all future rendering and graphics work. On top of that we'll be reworking the shader system and resource management to better map those new APIs and take advantage of new features exposed by the new APIs and shader languages. Especially memory management is going to be a fairly complex matter and far more trivial but crucial in order to get the best performance. Don't underestimate the support work of video drivers do on DX11 and OpenGL.\"\"Additionally we'll embrace asynchronous compute, taking advantage of the heterogeneous multi-GPU set ups. On-board plus discrete GPU is another possibility that might yield extra gains. That is instead of alternate frame rendering, each GPU works on different tasks for a given frame. This need some initial research first though to see how it can work and if the performance gains are actually worth the effort that they put into it.\"\"In summary, we agree that adopting these API's is going to be essential moving forward but at the same time we want to take our time to get stuff done properly so you'll actually see a benefit over DX11, visually and in terms of performance.\"So answer yes we're absolutely concerned with future-proofing. I wanted to be able to read that and although I probably messed up pronunciation a little bit. The guys that are working on stuff here they know their stuff. We want to set this up in the right way that we know it going to be able to milk every thing we can. That we get the best performance. That we can support the best hardware and so on.

Because of how the seats are broken down with everything.KT: Well sure. When we get the NPCs to work, you'll actually give them contracts and so you're telling them what to do with the ship. So if the command is I'm transferring my cargo to this ship that is owned by me and I want you to take it to our hanger or base or wherever and sell it, that is something is planned to happen and so you don't need to babysit all of the standard activities that a ship that you own can handle so long as your NPCs that can handle all the stations on that ship. So I think they will be a lot of fun becauseRV: It'll be risky thoughKT: Sure, but you know with that, it lets you give responsibilities for the stuff that you need to get done but may not want to sit down on the ship itself, awaiting its function to go do, so if it's a lesser task and I have a ship that can do that, why not let me do that?RV:I'd love to have a fleet of ships but at the same time do I want to bring a whole fleet out? If I get attacked, I can only do so much, it's a risk and reward.KT: Right and that's the decision you make and so I think that's where the fun comes because you figure out what works best for you and what you want the NPC's to handle, and with experience as time goes on I think people will figure out what works optimally for them.RV: So let's get like 10 hornets then and just have my one ship and I have 10  hornet escorts and a guy comes in and he's not going to mess with me.KT: Alright well I might wait for you outside your hanger and as soon as you seen your ship out and take everything you got, So that will be fun.", "published_at_timestamp": 1444686758, "question": "With many citizens owning multiple ships, I'm curious if it would be possible to staff 'spare' ships entirely by NPCs?

Or is the ship size for escorts limited so only little ships like the Herald, Hornet and so on can be used for escorts?

And is one of the many aims of this policy of setting a real world price in UEC to combat gold farmer induced inflation?", "answer": "Obviously inflation and deflation is a threat to most economies we are on our side because I mentioned the nine to ten player to AI ratio so ninety percent of the universe is AI that obviously us as the game masters have an influence over. They trade, they go about their daily lives, they earn money, do all these things so it's actually a pretty good tool to make sure that if a player finds an exploit and does all this other stuff it won't totally create a new economy because ninety percent of the commerce is happening in the AI world and we have control over that so if we see something spinning out of control on the player side we could potentially counter it with the AI side. That's one of the ideas that not to be too beholden to say price fixing or any kind of machinations that  players could get together and do. They will have the ability to affect to some form of the economy in a more localised fashion but since there are only ten percent of players overall in the universe they won't have the ability to affect the economy in a more overbearing or global basis. As far as real world price and UEC we're not doing a subscription fee so where we think we'll be earning money long term to pay for servers and adding new content besides new people joining and buying their game package is for the people that love the game but they just don't have thirty hours a week to be flying around doing stuff but they want to get that cool ship or that cool weapon so they'll be able to buy some UEC and that will get him there. That falls to the whole time versus money argument. So it's not so much to combat gold farmers and more one of the ways we'll be supporting the game once it's live. We will definitely be putting some things in there to make it difficult for a bunch of gold farmers to go and sell people UEC it's almost impossible to fully stop stuff cause people can build up an account and then just transfer the account and sell it, but you won't just be able to wire people money with no cost and no checks and stuff like that. So we'll see how it goes it's still early days and i'm sure there will be plenty of things we haven't realised that we'll have to adjust but that's part of the point of getting you guys in early.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 68", "source": "https://youtu.be/FkjfyVDhzNs", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Capstone", "published_at_timestamp": 1443477905}, {"objectID": "373681730", "question": "Hi Chris, Multi-crew is most appealing part of Star Citizen game play for me. A somewhat obscure game called Artemis has done a great job of this by granting each member of the ships crew an interesting and involving role and at the same time making them very reliant on the input from their shipmates. How does Star Citizen plan to implement multi-crew in a compelling way?", "answer": "Well I think that the answer is pretty much the same way. We are looking at various different stations and seats around the multi-crew ships. We will show off some of it in a limited fashion at Gamescom. But you are going to have your helm, your sort of radar scanning, your engineering section, obviously people in things like turrets to protect and we are going to have specific gameplay that's there so when you are working with your other shipmates manning the ship whether it's tracking things or protecting the ship or fixing things or balancing shields at the whole shield station we sort of have for the multi-crew. So essentially if you and your friends are working together, we will allow you to do a lot more to control the things with a lot more fidelity. If you are flying a ship by yourself then doing things like adjusting your power or adjusting your shields while aiming while flying while adjusting the throttle &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; it's a lot of stuff to do at once so if that gets distributed between different crew members on a multi-crew ship you will be able to do those things more effectively. So we are definitely building it that way. There will be short term chat but long term we're looking for VoIP between the different players, so you can be talking to your friends.  In the short term I'm pretty sure everyone will be using TeamSpeak and stuff like that. But yeah if you have seen those starship simulators, there are a few of them out there, we will have similar gameplay although it will be real time and at much higher fidelity and it will be pretty cool.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 62", "source": "https://youtu.be/zt4r3ksHXng", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Scout", "published_at_timestamp": 1438639238}, {"objectID": "211906d900f4a_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The Starliner would function both in atmosphere and space equally.

Potentially in a bigger ship we might let you go up to say medium armour as there's more room to move around etc, not 100%. But the rule is essentially light or below to be piloting the small fighter ships, and then if there are bigger ships we might see medium armour or heavy, titan armour I doubt you'd be able to sit down and pilot ships in it. In terms of how long it takes to put all the armour on? Well we haven't decided yet, but it certainly wouldn't take as long as it might take to ACTUALLY strap on that much armour, we might just have an animation where you'd kinda do {this} and suddenly you'd be in.

I don't think we were really planning on that. You know, \"to rent of buy these devices for the Persistent Universe,\" I think we would probably have most of the racetracks be sort of preset and predetermined in the universe. I could see, with the systems we have, we could probably have the little holo-projectors and you could EVA and place them around an environment, but the problem is that wouldn't really have persistence the way that a proper racetrack would, because you'd be in an instance and as soon as you left it, it wouldn't happen.

A repair BAY. And off in the distance you'll see either little robots, or maybe some ground crew moving around doing sparking and welding. And long-term we'd kind of like to try and get a little bit more of that ambient animation in.

Thanks!", "answer": "Well we actually have an exploration kind of science ship, so we'll definitely be able to do ship optimization, over clocking, all the rest of the stuff.I think there'll be some level of explorer, artifact hunting/searching stuff which we haven't fully fleshed out yet, but we've got this whole salvage and exploration mechanic, we've got certain ships specifically for it, we're gonna have some sort of space hulks and some ancient ruins, and space wrecks from long ago space civilizations.So there'll be some cool stuff that you'll be able to get some equipment and you'll be able to take that and maybe take it somewhere else and essentially get it built into some special weapon or special item that will give you some abilities or powers that you may not have with the standard off-the-shelf stuff, so I think there'll be that level of stuff.I don't know exactly the mechanics of it 'cause we're still at early stages of working it out, but we definitely want to have that sort of varied feeling, so there's a whole profession where you could just go exploring and looking for artifacts and maybe occasionally there'll be one or two of them that'll be useful and they'll be used for something else or at least you could sell them. So there will be some level of analysis, we'll see. As far as lifeforms go, I don't know, there's the... The fiction in our world is that finding or interacting with new lifeforms is kind of regulated, so you're not really going to be able to discover them.We're gonna have a fun commercial up and coming, not the Freelancer one, but the one after it which kind of plays with this idea, but I don't know so much about really discovering new lifeforms.Although we have discussed that, when we introduce one or two of the new alien races that we're discussing, we would actually let a player make the first encounter. We'll build it all up, but we won't announce it. We would open up an area of space, and one of the first players that would discover that jump point and go through it would actually encounter this alien race for the first time.But that's not something that will be possible for all the players, it would just be possible for one player, or if we have a second one, another player, and that wouldn't be very frequent. But that would be super cool were you actually the person who made the encounter, actually a real player and he gets immortalized in the Galactipedia and in our in-fiction news casts.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 22.
