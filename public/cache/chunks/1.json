To get there, our plan is to gradually increase player count per shard and constantly improve the backend and client tech to support more and more players.<br/><br/>It's not just technology changes that are required to get to this goal - new game design and game mechanics are needed too. Without mechanics to prevent every single player going to the same location, a large mega shard will be very hard to achieve, especially on the client. For example, there could be a mechanic to temporarily close jump points to crowded locations, or create new layers for certain locations.<br/><br/>While the backend is designed to scale horizontally, the game client runs on one single machine and is limited to a definite number of CPU/GPU cores as well as memory.<br/><br/>Only once we overcome these hurdles, and accomplish one mega-shard per region, will we be able to take on the final boss: Merging regional shards into one global mega shard.<br/><br/>This comes with its own set of issues, as locality plays a big role in the player experience. For example, latency between services within the same datacenter is much lower than latency between services that are hosted in two regionally-separated datacenters.

The Reliant is going to be the ship that's going to be coming up in the hangar next which is my favourite small ship and the Reliant is just so cool. Concepted by David Hoppins and it was passed over to Elwin and Dan Kamentsky and the ship team here to flesh out that ship and they just did an awesome job and it's so cool looking, it's a super... the way that it flies and like the cockpit turns and it's just going to be super cool and I can't wait to get that in the hangar and even more that's just going to be so like, I'm gonna want to fly it as soon as I see it in the hangar and just bust through the hangar doors and I'm going to have to stare at it for awhile, but I can't wait to fly that thing.Then next up I think is probably going to be, and we're talking more down the line, we're not talking tomorrow, we're talking down the line, will be the Caterpillar which is also a super awesome ship and it's one of the first ships that's going to be from an art direction standpoint, is a little different because it's built very... it's chunky, but it's kind of used parts, it has like elements of it that are almost like painted on top paint and they're just welding metal on top of wiring and stuff and it's not just perfectly encased and built, its kind of been welded together and just taken parts that they had and built on it. So it has this very cool industrial kind of...Cherie Heiberg: Rad.FS: Look, right? And it's just super cool looking. Things are exposed and it's just kind of heavy and you're like I couldn't even lift one of these panels off the wall, it's too heavy, it's not just made out of that slick material and so it is just cool looking. I've seen lots of shots of what that looks like inside, in the game already and so that's super cool.CH: I haven't seen those, why haven't you shown me?FS: Then we'll take a look at this afterwards, sorry about that.CH: [laughs]FS: Further down the road, even further, further is going to be the Herald. That will be Later this year and I think that's okay to say, it's a safe bet. Later down this year and that's being worked on also in Austin by Josh. So that's going to be... I'm excited about that ship as well because that's definitely a little different, it's kind of a little more interesting looking, it has little satalite things that pop out so Josh Coons is no doubt making that thing amazing.

Will we just have to hope to shoot their engines off and not destroy their ship or can we look forward to some sort of tractor-beam technology?", "answer": "As I sort of discussed a little bit of this when we were talking about Quantum Drive and we're thinking about several things like, the whole ability to interdict is something that we're working on, all the ins and outs and edge cases of it. We do not want people to be able to jump away during combat.First of all, they're going to have to be able to get far enough away from whoever they're fighting to have enough separation to spin up the Quantum Drive, they can't have anything that's blocking them inside. We've talked about certain things like the power drain needed to actually do the jump may drop your shields or whatever else it would make you vulnerable, if there's other people around trying to take you out.We're also talking about when you come out of Quantum Drive, let's say you get interdicted, you can't just instantly go to cruise. Your engines will have to cool down, there will be a moment of vulnerability where if you're getting interdicted you'll have to survive for awhile before you can spin up to cruise to try and get away. Then get far enough then maybe you can Quantum Drive again, that's kind of the idea.So, one of the idea of the interdiction is that you deploy a kind of, whatever you want to call it, a gravity well generator which can be something that your ship deploys or you could deploy it...  kind of think of it as putting a mine out there or something or a hook to catch fish going by. Definitely there is going to be plenty of ways to stop people from jumping away, the gameplay you see right now in the mini PU, will not be the actual final gameplay.We're working on the systems, like everything we've got a massive list of things to do and it's really just comes down to priorities because we could have double the amount of game programmers and they'd probably still be saying, 'We don't have enough people'.

How will that work so people and their friends always get into the same instance to work as a team?", "answer": "Right so I touched a little bit of the top of this Ten for the Chairman talking about the fact we are working on getting more and more people into an individual instance or really what it's more about is getting more people into an individual game server.So right now if you play in Crusader on 2.2 they'll be twenty four players that could be in that now that's one game server instance. We actually have that, there's eight of those I believe, yep, the thirty two core server we're running on and we have eight game server instances on that one thirty core server each using four cores. Now the real goal would be not to have eight on that, it would be rather to have one game server on that one thirty two core machine. So then if we have eight people now and you add eight times twenty four, you're getting a much larger number of people around me almost at two hundred people at that point and that would be on one server. That's without us doing more and more optimisations, so that's what we're moving towards.Then on the client side, even though the server could maybe deal with more entities because it doesn't have to render, it doesn't have to move all the memory around from it. It just has deal with the background simulation and updating stuff. The clients may not be able to but then the clients would make sure what's around you, what you can see is what it's drawing and updating and being told from by the server. Then on top of that we're planning to have seamless server transitions and basically mesh the servers together. So instead of 'I'm in Stanton System and I'm on one server or i'm on a second server or a third server in Stanton System'.That's not the way Stanton's going to work. It's going to be very dynamic and we'll actually have, say you start with one server and people fly around it can be anywhere in Stanton just like what you can do right now in Crusader, but then as you go beyond the cap say, just for simplicity's sake, say we can run fifty people on a server right?So thirty people, forty people they're all running around Stanton doing their stuff no problem, AI's are doing their stuff. But now a whole new bunch of people come in and we move from thirty people to sixty people. Well ok that's more than we can fit on one server so at that point we will always have one probably server ticking over ready and you keep one as a buffer. So we'll say \"Ok we've got more than we can fit on one server\". So we migrate players to whichever server is appropriate and we just arbitrarily go \"Ok well there's a clump of players over here so this server will take care of them. There's a clump over here and this server will take care of them\". Both these servers have full global view of the whole star system, these servers also talk to each other as well as the clients.The server essentially responsible for say simulating the entities that its authoritative of. But it will also tell the other server if the other server needs to know what the entity that this server did with. So basically that's what edge case is. So it's like 'ok i'm updating these people but there's one guy over here that's coming towards you and you've got a guy over here'. So this server's saying \"Oh this is where this guy is\". So this server knows and has a copy of him in his memory space and vice versa so you can just basically resolve overlaps between server control areas. So that's kind of the aim. The idea is as more and more people come in you spin up more and more servers and they all mesh together so you can ultimately have hundreds if not thousands of people essentially all in the same instance.Then your real limitation is more about the client and what the client can render and see on its side. That's kind of the plan which is a more dynamic and actually a more advanced than I think ultimately better solution than what we talked before which was much more instance on top of each other and you can only ever see thirty other people or fifty other people or whatever it would be. I think that it's going to be good, so that's what we're working towards. There will probably be some cases where there will just be too many people. I can see in a landing area where there's maybe a thousand people hanging around the landing area. We just won't be able to have a thousand people. A hundred people will get together or five hundred say \"Let's go to the courtyard\". Well on a client you just can't render five hundred people. It just won't happen. So what we'll probably do  besides having aggressive LOD's at some point, you just cull out people beyond a certain area. But they'll all be tagged and known there as you move around as client people will come in and out of your visibility basically. Your sphere of visibility. I think it will seem pretty seamless.On top of that getting down to your friends which is one of the key parts of this question. We will know who are your acquaintances, who you've tagged as your person of interest, who you play, who is on your friends list, stuff like that. So if you're making decisions of who you can see, at some point if there's too many people in the client will think \"I just can't render this many people I have to choose some entities or people to not see\". It would not be the people you as a player have tagged as your friends or that you're interested in. So they would get preference in terms of the algorithm that determines who you see or who is culled out and who isn't culled out. I think it's going to be pretty cool.So you should be able to hang out and work with your friends. I think the only issues we're going to get, which will happen 'cause we have some pretty massive organisation, there is no way we can possibly have one of those massive thousand people in a space battle setups. But I do think we will probably able to get like quite a few hundred people doing that which will be pretty cool. But i'm sure you guys will figure out ways to break it but you know that's what it is. I think it will be a pretty cool experience.I am actually pretty excited by the tech that we're working for this, it's not going to happen overnight, it's going to take a lot of time because we're building something that's really, we're right on the cutting edge of this kind of stuff, there's a few other projects that are doing similar stuff, using the cloud architecture to dynamically scale and process much more on bigger denser worlds that you could do on a single server or single client which is what we're doing, but I think it's the future and I think it's going to be pretty cool.", "published_at": "2016-02-29", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 77", "source": "https://youtu.be/DFkTG9YungQ", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Killarious Maximillion", "time": "17m55s", "published_at_timestamp": 1456786477}, {"objectID": "9185cea607d07_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "Yes, the Sabre comes with a jump drive standard.", "published_at": "2015-10-16", "published_at_timestamp": 1444946400, "question": "Does it come with a jump drive?\t", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/15014-Q-A-Aegis-Sabre", "title": "Q&A: Aegis Sabre", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "40e19876703f6_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "No!

Will access to fuel be something organizations fight over in order to reach the most remote and valuable reaches of space?", "answer": "So on the fuel side, definitely the plan is fuel in terms of boost, in terms of your maneuvering jets - that is a finite thing that you have, that you have to either stock up, or you could could get a scoop and go into a gas giant and process into fuel. Haven't 100% decided whether there is another level of just general propellant fuel for your normal engines, and if you don't have that then, perhaps you can just drift at, you know, whatever, 10% of your, 5% of your top velocity. And that would just be based on, I dunno, small hydrogen atoms you can pick up that are very sparsely spread around space, or something like that. But the idea would really be that there should be some resource management in terms of fuel. So there definitely will be on sort of the overdrive, whatever you want to call it, the \"nitrous\" that we currently use for boost, which I think is a good gameplay mechanic because you want to make sure that you manage that in your dogfight and don't blow through it all. But there may also sort of general, overall fuel tanks for jumps - you know, so you have to have a certain amount of fuel to run your jump engine, and if you don't you'd have to go and collect it or harvest it from a gas giant - and generally travelling at warp speeds and normal speeds. And then if you were out of all the fuel, I don't think we would have you run completely out of gas, but you would probably inch along or maybe you have to do a distress call or something like that.But that's kind of currently where our thoughts are on that, but we haven't refined anything really beyond the base concept of the boost fuel. I mean we can have multiple styles of fuel - that's the whole pipe system we have, because we can determine any kind of resource and have it go between any kind of pipe, and have tanks to hold it. So the system already supports all that, so it's just whether we want to bifurcate the boost fuel from the general engine fuel, and do you wanna have a wrap drive fuel versus a normal engine fuel? So we haven't fully decided that, but that's all stuff that we're working on, and will be part of like, what we think is fun and challenging when you're flying around, and what would give good resource management, and you know... you should have advantages, right? You have a big exploration ship, drop tanks, and then you should be able to go further, so it probably will factor in.", "published_at": "2014-10-13", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 41 (2014.10.13)", "source": "https://youtu.be/4GflyTrFtTo", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Beer4TheBeerGod", "published_at_timestamp": 1413243710}, {"objectID": "373678870", "question": "Does this mean black boxes left over from PVP can be used to blackmail said PVPers? By capturing the Black Box of a pirate's victim can I then use that BB against the pirate?

And that distress beacon, in a regulated system there'd probably be, like, relays, and then the relays - they'll get broadcasted around, so it sort of is a report of the attack. And there will be some very expensive and hard to use-and-get equipment that will allow, you know, someone that's trying to do a heist, or a pirate to maybe potentially block a broadcast, but it won't be particularly easy to do and it will be something that we'd want, if someone's trying to do a heist - you know, like knocking out the equivalent of an armored truck or something - then they would have to maybe try and blanket out the local relays, and so they won't get the UEE after them.But I'm not so sure we're going to have a \"black box\" so to speak, because it's more like a distress beacon that gets sent out, and then either it gets picked up by the relays, or it gets somehow intercepted and blocked. So I guess you can't really do the blackmail. A black box is kind of an interesting idea, but right now that's not in the development plans.", "published_at": "2014-09-15", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 37 (2014.09.15)", "source": "https://youtu.be/HJnqq7DX68A", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Grimzod", "published_at_timestamp": 1410816374}, {"objectID": "373679310", "question": "Will players who focus on racing be able to achieve some sort of sponsorship with other in-fiction companies and be able to fly those names similar to what NASCAR racers do today?", "answer": "Well, I definitely want players to be able to focus on things like racing or doing other stuff. So we're gonna definitely have a whole racing series that will happen and exist in fiction, where there will be qualifiers a championship, and the people who are the best racers will be sort of covered, and lauded, and win prizes just like they do in the real world. So we're gonna do that. The idea of sponsorship is pretty cool - we've actually been kicking around the idea of sponsorship for some of the ships, so maybe we can sort of weave that into the fiction, because again that's another thing that makes it seem more real.But at the very least you certainly will be able to compete and, you know, have fame against all the other players that are in the Star Citizen universe, and be covered on the news report as being \"the Murray Cup champion of 2945\" and all the rest of the stuff. And perhaps we'll do some fun stuff like sponsorship deals.", "published_at": "2014-08-11", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 33 (2014.08.11)", "source": "https://youtu.be/XBVkhXGX8iI", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "The Arcfade", "published_at_timestamp": 1407796258}, {"objectID": "373683270", "question": "I was wondering what kind of landing zones there will be in Star Citizen? Will it just be mainly cities and space stations? Or will we be able to also land in some desolate areas, towns in the middle of nowhere, or unique areas?", "answer": "There will definitely be a fair number of cities and space stations, but we're gonna also have some areas that you land that aren't necessarily a big city. Potentially you can go a planet and there's nothing on it but there's, you know, an ancient ruin site, and that would be a landing area by itself. You could explore around that and it would have some ancient ruins and maybe you'd go down into some catacombs. There'll be occasionally out in space, a deserted alien ship, or a derelict wreck, or something that you could potentially explore, and longer-term we're sort of talking about more explorer mechanic stuff. So not short-term, but the longer-term -so this isn't gonna be v1.0 - but one of our long-term procedural goals is to be able to generate areas on new planets that maybe, once someone has found a jump point and going to a new system, then there would be areas that we would spawn that would allow people that are more explorer-inclined to go down and actually explore, and find and discover some stuff. And try not to be, sort of... you know, try and have some interest, and some cool stuff down there.So that's our sort of longer-term plan. So yeah, our goal is to try and create a variety of different landing environments, so it feels like there's a big, huge galaxy out there that you're exploring. Obviously we can't flesh it out to that level of detail that we're doing on our ships on every single centimeter, but if we have enough different locations that you go to that have different enough flavors, I think it will really give you this sense of a big, living, open universe.", "published_at": "2014-07-21", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 30.

There are a couple ways to get citizenship.One, you can buy your way in, which is like the old Roman way where a lot of people would buy their way to Roman citizenship, and that would just require you making a lot of money, being a trader, whatever, and then you can buy your way into being a citizen.Then the other way to become a citizen would be to perform jobs or missions that increase your civic or citizen status. If you've done enough of that, sort of public service stuff, taking jobs for the UEE, all that kind of stuff, that will add to points where at a certain level you're granted citizenship.So there are other ways to do it outside of Squadron 42.", "published_at": "2014-06-02", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 23.

Will they be present in the game or will there be something else?", "answer": "Chris Roberts: The goal of the game is to have you be able buy everything in the game with in-game credits. There\u2019s no\u2026the design of the game doesn\u2019t have things you can only purchase with real money. It\u2019s also not to make it that you have to have purchased in-game credits with real money because the game is sort of blocking you till you spend a certain amount. So the concept we have for it \u2013 and I don\u2019t know whether it will work out but we will see \u2013 is that once you bought the game you should be able to play it forever for free if you want.<br/><br/>Of course, if you don\u2019t have the time to play it and want to do something else, we can allow you to buy some credits with real money but we\u2019re going to sort of cap that on a monthly basis. There might be some people that back this game that don\u2019t have 20 hours a week to dedicate like a student would, right? They may have a few hours per weekend and they may have family and jobs but you know, they may want to fly fancy spaceships and not want to spend the time earning the credits to buy it. They\u2019ll buy some credits and fly a spaceship that way. So basically, you have to pay with either time or money but paying with time is not a punishment because that\u2019s actually where the fun is. The whole point of the game is running around and making money.<br/><br/>I think that\u2019s a good enough balance and I hate games which force you to buy stuff and I don\u2019t want to buy. I don\u2019t really want that in this game and between that and bringing new people in the fold, hopefully we\u2019ll generate enough money to maintain servers  and add new content to the game.", "published_at": "2014-02-05", "title": "Star Citizen Interview: Chris Roberts On Building A Space Simulator For The Ages", "source": "https://gamingbolt.com/star-citizen-interview-chris-roberts-on-building-a-space-simulator-for-the-ages", "type": "article", "user": "Ravi Sinha", "published_at_timestamp": 1391558400}, {"objectID": "26bae606e8258_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "I just wanted to ask if some of the larger ships will have sub roles such as engineers that will need to maintain sub systems? or individual gunners manning posts, etc?
