It can be earned through the completion of an upper or full secondary UEE-certified education program or through passing a group of subject tests issued by the UEE government. All civilians in the UEE must earn their Equivalency in order to pursue post-secondary education, enter the armed services, or earn full Citizenship. </p><br/><h1>OVERVIEW</h1><br/><p>As outlined by the Common Laws, all people born in the UEE have the right to an education. Between ages 13 to 14, the majority of students in the UEE begin their secondary education at public schools overseen by teachers employed by a planet's Governors Council. Classroom size and teaching style vary from planet to planet, but all students are required to complete a standardized exam that has been standardized according to UEE educational requirements. Most students are awarded their Equivalency between ages 17 and 18.    </p><br/><p>People in the UEE who don't have access to planet or colony-provided secondary education are able to complete their secondary education programs through the same educational programs that are provided to public school students via Glas or computer system. Rural students often complete their education through Spectrum-guided learning programs. Without a teacher to set the pace, provide lectures, or to address questions, self-guided students are free to achieve Equivalency whenever they have completed their program. </p><br/><p>Private and military academies also offer courses in secondary education. The teacher- to- student ratio in these academies is generally smaller than that of public schools, and the education is more personalized. However, these courses are not government provided. All students must pay tuition, either out of pocket or through grants and scholarships. </p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>During the Human Colonial Expansion Era (2380 - 2530), secondary education was required by law for all children born within the United Nations of Earth (UNE). As more planets were discovered and colonized, the law became difficult to enforce. Children born to the first settlers of early colony worlds who could not be sent back to more developed parts of the UNE for their education were homeschooled, if they were schooled at all. To address this gap in education, in 2464 the UNE released a standardized set of computer-based learning modules called the Educational Equivalency Curriculum (EEC). These modules replaced in-person education on worlds where teachers and schools were not yet available. Those who successfully completed the program were awarded an Educational Equivalency Degree (EED), or Equivalency, which certified that the holder had completed all secondary-level education requirements under UNE law.</p><br/><p>The Equivalency was intended to be a temporary replacement for in-person education until colony worlds established stable local governments. However, as intersystem expansion continued, more and more Humans completed their secondary education via EEC. When the Common Laws were established in 2526, the United Planets of Earth (UPE) designated the EEC as the standardized secondary education curriculum. The provision of a formalized education and offering Equivalency exams became the responsibility of all local governments. </p><br/><p>During the Messer Era (2546 - 2792), the EEC was edited multiple times to indoctrinate the populace into pro-Messer ideology. Xenology and sociology modules were increasingly seeded with anti-alien, pro-Human thought. The history module was especially edited; key events in Ivar Messer's rise to power were presented as the plans of aliens seeking to destabilize the government. Events directly perpetrated by the Messers or their agents that could not be blamed on aliens, such as military action against Human-led protests, were not taught at all. </p><br/><p>Following the fall of Linton Messer XI in 2792, all EEC modules were recalled by the new government and were completely revised. Secondary school was suspended until a new version of the EEC with a detailed history on the Messer Era was released in 2794. </p><br/><p>The EEC is updated and revised once every ten years.

We do integrate a lot of feedback that we get from experts in various fields, but at the same time because it's a science-fiction world there is a certain amount of suspension of belief involved. For example, the Vanguard is a swing-wing spacecraft, in terms of aerodynamics, it doesn't matter if it's a swing-wing or not, but we gave it a purpose anyway, because it looks cool and we wanted to have it in-game. Same thing with a torpedo, traditionally it's a projectile launched underwater, so it might retain its fins in space, but they don't really do anything. So while expert critique does factor into our decisions, we have to make it fun, and if a really realistic sim gets in the way of that, I'd rather go with the fun route.Travis Day: Yeah, it's the same with what was pointed out on the retaliator, based of his feedback on the original behring marksman, that the torpedos look a lot like Mark 48's, and don't have any thrusters on them for attitude adjustment, so we should probably add thrusters on them. The other hard thing about the internet is that a lot of our forum community ARE armaments experts or engineers, but it is also the internet.

The idea is that they would be on trade or consumption. So, if you land down on a planet you have to pay a landing fee and then if you buy or sell stuff then you will have to pay a sales tax or value-added tax. So, basically there will be things taxed on buying and selling and essentially landing is a kind of a tax or a fee.Then, organizations themselves will be able to have certain taxation or tithing. You could dictate: \"To be part of the guild, you have to contribute 10% of your income to us.\" or \"You have to contribute 1000 UEC a month.\" That will be settable on the organization side. Basically for belonging to the organization or for the things the organizations provides, you have to pay them. I guess it's kind of the same as being part of a country &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; that's why you pay your taxes so you have various things like armed forces and roads and stuff like that.That's kind of the idea.

That said, you don't want to make it like real life where you have to use the toilet, or eat 3 square meals a day or whatever. I was in favour of the light immersion factor which is something like, say, if you didn't shower for a week, someone might make a face at you due to the smell or look, and thus might be -1 to your reputation/conversation with that person. Sleeping is what we're using as a save mechanic too, but perhaps occasionally if you rest in the PU or eat it might affect your stamina or something. I do think things like drinking too much alcohol should make your vision blurry, but perhaps if you never ate anything ever you might get weaker. It should be fun, but just a light RPG immersion factor, like you could walk up to the Constellation dinner table and press a button, have a meal appear and your character might have a little bit of a bonus from eating it. It shouldn't feel like you have to do it all the time like a chore, but that it'd be good to do every now again.

Can you please explain the process of bug-tracking and solving in detail? What's the average time frame from reporting to solving bugs. How many people are involved in the bug solving process, etc? Can you explain the systematics of QA to avoid bugs in the first place?", "answer": "Darian Vorlick: You kind of asked the right two people about that! How it works is, we have our QA testers, whether they're testing in game or we get bugs reported from you in the community, the bugs are then recorded within our own bug tracking software. From there the producers take a look at which developers have the bandwidth and what the nature of the bug is. So if it's going to be, for example a HUD or UI bug then chances are it would go to Zane. So we have producers look at everybody's task loads and assign those bugs out to each individual person, and we try to get rough estimates of how long each one would take to resolve from those developers. And that kind of helps us build our work load for particular week, or even month.Travis Day: Yeah, no, it's gonna be kind of a bad answer to this question 'cause it's contextual, at least in regards to the part of \"how long does it take to fix something?\", right? So, a very important part of the bug process is, especially when we're in the finalling process right now, is triaging, right? So we get in issues reported by QA, and maybe something's really important to one guy, but it's not important for the product overall - so he marks it as \"critical\", we lower it to \"moderate\" or \"trivial\" in JIRA. (JIRA is the bug tracking software that we use). And essentially something, depending on the priority and how long it's going to take to fix, really informs the speed at which we're going to fix it. So for example in AC 1.0 we're focusing very heavily on these new ships that we're introducing that you'll see very soon (or have already seen depending on the air date of this episode), and what's cool about is a lot of the kind of more legacy ship issues, or things that we know we're going to go back and rework later, we're not going to end up spending time on them. So it's about prioritization and managing people's work loads against the milestones and releases that they have coming up. So to answer the length question, it might take five minutes to fix a bug bug it might not get fixed for a week, depending on somebody else's priorities, right?DV: Especially if we have something that's blocking us releasing the build, so you know, if you've got into a ship and the client crashes, even if that was a five minute fix, obviously that's going to be a higher priority than something like a gun's appearing slightly off. So it's just constant managing of priorities - what can we push back to the next build, or next version, or next update, given a limited time frame? Like right now we're so close to the 1.0 release, that we have to look at what bugs are not going to be important enough to push back.TD: Yeah, and if you want to impress your friends with, like, certain vernacular, that may or may not be commonly known... \"WNF\" - \"will not fix\", means if you get a bug and you look at it and you go, \"meh, not high enough priority to fix for this release - WNF. Kick it off to the next version.\" If you get something that's tough to reproduce and you can see somebody spending sixteen hours on it because it's like, \"oh, we had eight players, and 20% of the time when I think I was kinda doing this it maybe crashed\" ... \"CNR, low priority,\" so \"can not reproduce, low priority.

But the idea is as the ships get built and put in the engine, we'll make them available in the hangar, and then you can fly them. When they're available in the hangar, you should be able to pledge for it and put it in your own hangar, and then once we have all the damage states and the LoDs, you'll be able to fight with them in the Dogfight Module.I would say that they'll probably be available before the game is finished, definitely.

These date ranges are dynamic according to the challenges presented to us at that time, and we actively maintain that to keep you up to date.</li></ul><ul><li>The <a href=\"https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/15842-Letter-From-The-Chairman-The-Road-Ahead\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/15842-Letter-From-The-Chairman-The-Road-Ahead\" target=\"_blank\">scope of 3.0 is not insignificant</a></a>, as Chris discussed in <a href=\"https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link//15842-Letter-From-The-Chairman-The-Road-Ahead\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link//15842-Letter-From-The-Chairman-The-Road-Ahead\" target=\"_blank\">https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link//15842-Letter-From-The-Chairman-The-Road-Ahead</a></a>. It introduces a level of tech and infrastructure that\u2019s an order of magnitude larger and more complex than all of our previous versions combined. There are thousands of new assets, millions of entities to manage, new UI, new features, multiple new backend services, etc. all being introduced in 3.0.</li></ul><ul><li>Integrating all of this has revealed to be MUCH more of a bug fixing project than anticipated, which obviously reshapes those estimates and changes those dates. Hammering in a level of polish that we\u2019ve not aimed for before requires an additional adjustment of dates.</li></ul><ul><li>There\u2019s certainly no malice behind it, and anyone who makes that claim is providing an uninformed opinion. Ask any project manager or developer who worked on sophisticated software or has been involved on a complex project with lots of dependencies and moving parts. They'll gladly share how challenging a task of estimates can be.</li></ul><ul><li>The heroic efforts of those creating and maintaining the Production Schedule should be commended. They represent our efforts to keep up with this complex and ever evolving ecosystem, and work tirelessly to keep you up to date through regular sweat and tears (and I think I saw blood once). It\u2019s its own massive behemoth of a project, and they do it each week for you. :blush:</li></ul><p>It's just not in our DNA to hold updates and content back. We simply don\u2019t do that. When it\u2019s ready for primetime, it\u2019s out the door for you to enjoy. </p><br/><p>It\u2019s also important to consider that what 3.0 meant a year ago is a shadow of what 3.0 means today. Back then, Planetary Tech would have offered a fraction of the freedom that it does in 3.0, and most of the numerous infrastructure updates going into it now did not exist. [WL: Edited previous sentence for clarity] Roughly speaking, the approach was that we\u2019d be able to deliver four roughly built, predetermined, pre-scripted, landing zones. The reality is that those would have been rather limited, and ultimately, somewhat of a variation of what Area 18 ArcCorp is today in terms of features and functionality. </p><br/><p>Today, 3.0 is about delivering an entirely explorable solar system with the backend services to make it dynamic. It\u2019s about giving us the city and planet building tools to create for you the rest of the universe in an intelligent, scalable, efficient, and compelling manner. It\u2019s about the first step in giving you the tools to create player outposts and communities. It\u2019s about the streaming tech to allow you to take off from one moon, fly across the system, and land on an entirely different moon, the driving a freaking sweet buggy out of the back of your ship to race around the entire planet... all without a loading screen. It\u2019s about giving you the ability to buy what\u2019s on the web inside kiosks. It\u2019s about usable turret gameplay, and Items 2.0 so you can customize your own ship with new components. It\u2019s about picking objects and cargo so you can haul commodities across space as a trader and merchant. It\u2019s about gutting a singleplayer engine to support thousands of players. It\u2019s about infrastructure that we needed to develop because there are no off-the-shelf solutions for building an immersive experience like no other. </p><br/><p>And that\u2019s just part of what's in 3.0!</p><br/><p>The entire company is working feverishly to get you 3.0. Our goal is to provide you with the most amazing gaming experience ever. We\u2019ve learned that we can deliver something better than the original 3.0, something bigger, something pretty groundbreaking, something magnificent. </p><br/><p>That doesn\u2019t always keep to a schedule, but we think it\u2019s ok to take the time to do it right. :blush:</p><br/><p>Happy Sunday everyone,</p><p>Will \"Soulcrusher\" Leverett</p><p>Director of Player Relations</p>", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/3/thread/production-schedule-and-3-0", "published_at_timestamp": 1526128179, "title": "Production Schedule and 3.0", "type": "post"}]
