It consists of one mesoplanet, two terrestrial planets, one gas giant, one asteroid belt, and a G-type main sequence star. It was discovered in 2402 and colonized only seven years later, owing to the presence of two planets that needed only minimal terraformation to be habitable. Selene (Vega III) is recognized by the UEE, holding one seat in the Senate. Aremis (Vega II) was recognized by the UEE on 10 November 2945, in the aftermath of the Battle of Vega II. </p><br/><p>As one of the UEE systems bordering Vanduul territory, Vega is under heavy patrol by the UEE military. </p><br/><h1>PLANETARY SYSTEM</h1><br/><p>The system's star, Vega, is a G-Type main sequence star roughly 6.6 billion years old and about 80% the size of Sol. The closest planetary body to it is the mesoplanet Vega I, a hot and desolate rock with a silicate crust. Aremis (Vega II) and Selene (Vega III) are rocky planets terraformed to support Human life. An asteroid belt with an active mining population sits between Selene and Vega IV, a reddish-brown gas giant orbited by refineries. </p><br/><h1>DISCOVERY</h1><br/><p>Vega was discovered during the Human Colonial Expansion Era (2380 - 2530), thanks to the United Nations of Earth (UNE) Eastern Expansion Program. On 02 June 2402, surveyor Barbara Nagasaki found an anomaly in the Oberon system that suggested the presence of a jump point. After conferring with her son Marcus and her sister Vicki, who had accompanied her on this mission, the family decided to bring their ship closer to the anomaly to scan for its signature. Moments after they launched the scan, they accidentally triggered the jump, and the ship was pulled into interspace. Thanks to Marcus' experience in navigation and Vicki's quick piloting reflexes, they regained control of the ship and safely guided it to a new planetary system. Once the Nagasakis completed a survey of the new system, they safely traveled through the jump point a second time, journeyed to Earth (Sol III), and reported their findings to the UNEEEP.</p><br/><h1>HISTORY</h1><br/><p>Located in the green band, the planets Vega II and Vega III were lightly terraformed and opened for settlement in 2409. The population rapidly increased after 2412, when Alaine Viktus found the Virgil-Vega jump point in the Vega system. This discovery kicked off Project Far Star (2412 - 2681), a program that provided funding to navjumpers and terraforming companies in an effort to expand the borders of the UNE outward from the Virgil system. As expansion continued, Vega became a crossroads between such systems as Orion, Tiber, Bremen, and Terra. Vega II was largely settled by the military, while Vega III rose as a center for commerce and culture, receiving its recognition from the UEE Senate as Selene in 2573. It seemed that the Vega system was well on its way to becoming one of the most influential in the UEE.</p><br/><p>In 2712, however, its fortunes shifted. The Orion system, only three jumps away from Vega, was suddenly and unexpectedly lost to the Vanduul. Population growth stalled. Sprawling construction projects built ahead of a projected population increase were abandoned, and the economy entered a recession. In 2736 and 2737, Selene's situation became even more dire when the Vanduul wrenched the Tiber and Virgil systems from the grasp of the UEE, putting Vega directly on the border of Vanduul territory. Refugees from Virgil chose to resettle on Vega II instead of Selene, due to its strong military presence. Experts believed that Vega would be the Vanduul's next target. Once one of the fastest-growing systems in the UEE, Vega's population growth entered the negatives.</p><br/><p>In the mid 2800s, Vega II broke this pattern. Initially drawn by the cheap and available real estate, people from outside the system began to purchase homes and settle there. Then, in 2884, the Vanduul invaded the Caliban system instead of moving on Vega as had been predicted. The prevailing sense of danger in the system eased, especially on Vega II, under the direct protection of the military. By the early 2940s, it became more populous and prosperous than Selene, and the planet made a bid for Senate recognition. </p><br/><p>The feared Vanduul invasion finally arrived in 2945, when a large Clan accompanied by a rarely-sighted Kingship entered the system and launched a direct attack on Vega II. The UEE Navy's 2nd Fleet, commanded by Admiral Ernst Bishop, had been tracking scouts of this Clan and was in the area when the attack was launched. After a lengthy battle, the vastly outnumbered UEEN forces managed to destroy the Kingship and drive the Vanduul out of the system. The effects on Vega II were devastating; entire cities were wiped out and the death toll was in the millions. </p><br/><p>In the aftermath of the attack, Imperator Costigan and the UEE Senate officially recognized Vega II as Aremis and Edward Aemile as its first senator. Buildings damaged in the Battle of Vega II have since been restored or replaced. </p><br/><h1>CULTURE</h1><br/><p>Vega is known throughout the UEE for its food. Selene's low cost of living and available land supports an urban farming movement in most of the planet's cities. In Titus, the planet's most populous city, there is a rising number of farm-to-table restaurants supported by city-grown fruits and vegetables. The nature of the food served changes depending on the time of year and what can be grown in each locale. On Aremis, the food culture is centered around molecular gastronomy. Elaborate meals based on experimental techniques are commonplace in New Corvo. </p><br/><p>Because it is located on the border of Vanduul territory, the threat of Vanduul invasion never fully leaves the consciousness of the people of Vega. Absurdist art, reflective of existential dread and the folly of war, is popular on Selene. There is also an artistic movement towards returning to nature. Bizarre pieces that express irrationality and degradation of form can be found in local galleries as easily as a sculpture made entirely from reclaimed or organic materials. Aremis, home to many descendants of refugees from Orion, Tiber, Caliban, and Virgil, offers a contrasting picture; the art there is decadent, sensuous, and experimental.

So we will do that level of it and gravity will have some effect on flight, on atmospheric flight and all that kind of stuff as well.You can actually even now if you fly in the game and go onto some of the landing pads, the landing pads themselves have artificial gravity in a certain volume around them and in that case the actual flight model compensates for it, so the thrusters and everything produce additional thrust to negate the gravity so it does actually affect the flight model and we were anticipating all these when we get down and do stuff closer to planets and there's atmosphere and all the rest of the stuff then there'll be even more of that.", "published_at": "2015-12-14", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 72", "source": "https://youtu.be/oiXlK8UtLhg", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Irathi", "published_at_timestamp": 1450133932}, {"objectID": "128635adb73b7d_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "No.", "published_at": "2015-11-26", "published_at_timestamp": 1448492400, "question": "Does the Warlock have any remaining cargo room?

We do integrate a lot of feedback that we get from experts in various fields, but at the same time because it's a science-fiction world there is a certain amount of suspension of belief involved. For example, the Vanguard is a swing-wing spacecraft, in terms of aerodynamics, it doesn't matter if it's a swing-wing or not, but we gave it a purpose anyway, because it looks cool and we wanted to have it in-game. Same thing with a torpedo, traditionally it's a projectile launched underwater, so it might retain its fins in space, but they don't really do anything. So while expert critique does factor into our decisions, we have to make it fun, and if a really realistic sim gets in the way of that, I'd rather go with the fun route.Travis Day: Yeah, it's the same with what was pointed out on the retaliator, based of his feedback on the original behring marksman, that the torpedos look a lot like Mark 48's, and don't have any thrusters on them for attitude adjustment, so we should probably add thrusters on them.

The idea is that they would be on trade or consumption. So, if you land down on a planet you have to pay a landing fee and then if you buy or sell stuff then you will have to pay a sales tax or value-added tax. So, basically there will be things taxed on buying and selling and essentially landing is a kind of a tax or a fee.Then, organizations themselves will be able to have certain taxation or tithing. You could dictate: \"To be part of the guild, you have to contribute 10% of your income to us.\" or \"You have to contribute 1000 UEC a month.\" That will be settable on the organization side. Basically for belonging to the organization or for the things the organizations provides, you have to pay them. I guess it's kind of the same as being part of a country &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; that's why you pay your taxes so you have various things like armed forces and roads and stuff like that.That's kind of the idea.

That said, you don't want to make it like real life where you have to use the toilet, or eat 3 square meals a day or whatever. I was in favour of the light immersion factor which is something like, say, if you didn't shower for a week, someone might make a face at you due to the smell or look, and thus might be -1 to your reputation/conversation with that person. Sleeping is what we're using as a save mechanic too, but perhaps occasionally if you rest in the PU or eat it might affect your stamina or something. I do think things like drinking too much alcohol should make your vision blurry, but perhaps if you never ate anything ever you might get weaker. It should be fun, but just a light RPG immersion factor, like you could walk up to the Constellation dinner table and press a button, have a meal appear and your character might have a little bit of a bonus from eating it.

Can you please explain the process of bug-tracking and solving in detail? What's the average time frame from reporting to solving bugs. How many people are involved in the bug solving process, etc? Can you explain the systematics of QA to avoid bugs in the first place?", "answer": "Darian Vorlick: You kind of asked the right two people about that! How it works is, we have our QA testers, whether they're testing in game or we get bugs reported from you in the community, the bugs are then recorded within our own bug tracking software. From there the producers take a look at which developers have the bandwidth and what the nature of the bug is. So if it's going to be, for example a HUD or UI bug then chances are it would go to Zane. So we have producers look at everybody's task loads and assign those bugs out to each individual person, and we try to get rough estimates of how long each one would take to resolve from those developers. And that kind of helps us build our work load for particular week, or even month.Travis Day: Yeah, no, it's gonna be kind of a bad answer to this question 'cause it's contextual, at least in regards to the part of \"how long does it take to fix something?\", right? So, a very important part of the bug process is, especially when we're in the finalling process right now, is triaging, right? So we get in issues reported by QA, and maybe something's really important to one guy, but it's not important for the product overall - so he marks it as \"critical\", we lower it to \"moderate\" or \"trivial\" in JIRA. (JIRA is the bug tracking software that we use). And essentially something, depending on the priority and how long it's going to take to fix, really informs the speed at which we're going to fix it. So for example in AC 1.0 we're focusing very heavily on these new ships that we're introducing that you'll see very soon (or have already seen depending on the air date of this episode), and what's cool about is a lot of the kind of more legacy ship issues, or things that we know we're going to go back and rework later, we're not going to end up spending time on them. So it's about prioritization and managing people's work loads against the milestones and releases that they have coming up. So to answer the length question, it might take five minutes to fix a bug bug it might not get fixed for a week, depending on somebody else's priorities, right?DV: Especially if we have something that's blocking us releasing the build, so you know, if you've got into a ship and the client crashes, even if that was a five minute fix, obviously that's going to be a higher priority than something like a gun's appearing slightly off. So it's just constant managing of priorities - what can we push back to the next build, or next version, or next update, given a limited time frame? Like right now we're so close to the 1.0 release, that we have to look at what bugs are not going to be important enough to push back.TD: Yeah, and if you want to impress your friends with, like, certain vernacular, that may or may not be commonly known... \"WNF\" - \"will not fix\", means if you get a bug and you look at it and you go, \"meh, not high enough priority to fix for this release - WNF. Kick it off to the next version.\" If you get something that's tough to reproduce and you can see somebody spending sixteen hours on it because it's like, \"oh, we had eight players, and 20% of the time when I think I was kinda doing this it maybe crashed\" ... \"CNR, low priority,\" so \"can not reproduce, low priority.
