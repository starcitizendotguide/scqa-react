Rather than using heat to alter the nutrient bioavailability of ingredients as is traditionally done by Humans, Xi\u2019an utilize aging and fermentation. Xi\u2019an cannot digest the majority of fresh fare and are intolerant of hot or cold meals. Level of aging, type of fermentation, strength of flavor, and texture are the most important aspects of Xi\u2019an food preparation. Humans consider Xi\u2019an food to be harshly flavored.</p><br/><h1>History</h1><br/><p>The first indications of cultivated Xi\u2019an cuisine arose when Xi\u2019an established permanent homesteads. Before this time, they traveled in nomadic family groups, scouring the landscape for sustenance while protecting one another from predators. The hot, humid environment of their homeworld was conducive to rapid decay of potential food sources. Food with rich microbiomes such as carrion and rotted leaves made up the bulk of the early Xi\u2019an diet. Predators kept them on the move. It wasn\u2019t until agriculture and animal husbandry were discovered that families were able to create long-term settlements fortified against natural predators, allowing them time and space to experiment with meal preparation techniques.</p><br/><p>Major characteristics of contemporary Xi\u2019an cuisine soon emerged. Bacteria, molds, yeasts, and spices that enhanced food with intense textural sensations and robust flavors were sought after and cultivated. Aged eggs collected from abandoned <em>s.\u0101oth</em> nests became so popular that the lizard was domesticated. Meat harvested from animals allowed to die of natural causes became famous among prosperous families for being more tender and flavorful than meat from slaughtered animals; this attitude persists among Xi\u2019an chefs today. Meat that was heavily spiced, left to age in the sun until soft and pungent, and served alongside strips of the leafy vegetable<em> nga.u\u2019ii\u2019y\u0113l</em> became a favorite dish.</p><br/><p>The discovery of fermentation revolutionized the Xi\u2019an diet. Plants they couldn\u2019t previously digest, such as grain <em>pai'pun</em> and legume <em>pai\u2019lio</em>, became staples of their new diet. Vessels used for fermentation doubled as long-term food stores, allowing families to stockpile their resources and expand beyond homesteads into state-like powers called Houses. Demand for spice and other food additives opened trade routes between distant locations. As Houses continued to grow, so did the Xi\u2019an palate.</p><br/><h1>Flavor and Texture</h1><br/><p>Every Xi\u2019an dish is constructed to balance texture with intensity of flavor. 13 favorable tastes, 13 favorable textures, and 13 unfavorable qualities were identified by members of House Uai\u2019i in their treatise <em>Three Leaves of Flavor</em>. These were compiled into a text and sold to traders en route to other Houses. The treatise was hugely influential to Xi\u2019an cuisine as an art. Even today, the ideal <em>y.iy\u2019atin\u2019tang</em> (multitextured) meal described in the treatise remains the end goal for Xi\u2019an chefs.</p><br/><h1>Fermentation and Aging</h1><br/><p>Fermentation is the foundation of the Xi\u2019an diet. Ingredients are typically cut into large pieces, then seasoned and placed inside a <em>tyixa\u2019yetui</em> (fermentation vessel). The vessel is then placed inside the <em>nyuntui</em> (fermentation chamber), a temperature-controlled room with deeply grooved walls inoculated with colonies of yeast, mold, and bacteria. These <em>tya e Yii\u2019ua</em> (House strains), unique to each House and closely guarded, are cultivated over generations. At first, the vessels are left open to invite the strains into the process. The vessels are then sealed, usually for months, before being opened again, cut into bite-sized pieces, placed on large dishes, and served alongside other meals, most often at room temperature (30 C).</p><br/><p>Food that isn\u2019t fermented is aged via air-curing, sun-ripening, drying, controlled rot, the addition of micro-organisms, or other methods. If a dish has been prepared well, a Xi\u2019an might say that it is \u201cproperly rotted.\u201d A bland dish might be described as \u201clacking rot.\u201d This applies to beverages as well. One popular drink, <em>chui.y\u2019o\u2019sui</em>, is made from the aged blood of various animals and mixed with complimentary vinegars. Even purified water would be considered unpalatable to Xi\u2019an; on Xi\u2019an worlds, drinking water is enhanced with minerals and various micro-organisms for health and flavor.</p><br/><h1>Condiments</h1><br/><p>Xi\u2019an eat only a few times per week. Shared meals are considered a big family affair. Even Xi\u2019an who are traveling alone will choose to share tables with strangers at restaurants. At the center of a communal table filled with various dishes one can always find a <em>thauil</em> (condiments platter) loaded with seasonings and dressings that will impart various favorable flavors on one\u2019s food, such as <em>ki.s\u2019a</em> (ammoniac; chemical; bitter), <em>ngi\u2019pi</em> (itching; buzzing; pain), or <em>p.\u016bnt.a</em> (alcoholic, warming). Xi\u2019an do not experience intoxication from consuming alcohol, and some more forward-leaning Xi\u2019an restaurateurs on Oya III have added Human-influenced alcoholic seasonings to their menus.</p><br/><h1>Modern Trends</h1><br/><p>Since the thawing of tensions between the United Empire of Earth and the Xi\u2019an Empire (SaoXy'an), Xi\u2019an have begun to explore Human styles of cooking. Dishes such as shiokara, blue cheeses, and lutefisk have been unreservedly embraced by Xi\u2019an chefs. Cold-brewed pu-erh tea has made waves due to its similarity to <em>hai\u2019pe</em>, a beverage steeped in sunlight from the leaves of a tropical pine tree. The beverage rotik is similarly popular among adventurously-minded Xi\u2019an. This is especially notable because <em>nginguichui</em> (milky; creamy; like animal milk) has been considered an unfavorable food quality for hundreds of <em>millennia</em>. However, hot and cold food, also ill-regarded in the Xi\u2019an tradition, seems unlikely to catch on.", "title": "Galactapedia: Xi'an Cuisine", "id": "V3qvm96LeA", "slug": "xian-cuisine", "template": "ImageCaptionOnly", "type": "galactapedia"}, {"objectID": "54b37541f7ebd_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The Kiel system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) with six planets, an asteroid belt, and an F-type main sequence star.

Imagine you start rolling and then halfway through that you start pitching and then halfway through that you start yawing.

On a technical point of view, I mean.", "answer": "Brian Chambers: Uncharted 4 looks awesome. I think it was the day or so after it came out, we grabbed it and had it here at the studio and I told the team \"hey, let's go in the kitchen and talk to Chris about it and so on\". When I say kitchen, we had a couch in there with a console, so we all went in there and were playing it. They did an awesome job, it looks good, it plays nice.Generally in console development and I can just say this from experience: the games look nicer the longer the console exists. You understand how to use the hardware better, you understand how to go around or through or above or under the limitations that the hardware gives you. You find new tips and new tricks on how to put things together, manage memory/stream things, so on and so on and so on.So as you can see, if you look historically, even PS2 and so on, late generation PS2 games looked awesome comparatively, right? And it's just because people got more mature on how they can use the hardware. With that said there's still a ceiling, there's still a ceiling on that hardware on what's possible. You have technical limitations. If you're applying the same learning and then same logic to a piece of hardware that has a higher ceiling, in theory you would be able to produce more or do things better or do things more fluid. It doesn't necessarily mean that it would look better which is clearly what you're after right?Uncharted 4 looked great and it was based on a certain hardware and we had harder hardware, could you draw more characters on screen? Could you put a little more love into the atmospherics? Could you have more on hair, cloth animations, just all those as examples right?So yeah I think the team over there did an awesome job pulling it off, it looks amazing, yet that doesn't point directly that Star Citizen could run. As far as, \"hey would you consider it in the future?\" It's not really a point to think about right now or put energy on because the teams fully focused on delivering Star Citizen and Squadron 42 on PC like we promised to the community, to the backers, to the fans and so on, so that's really where all of our energy is.", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 13", "source": "https://youtu.be/hp5AlLytcn0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Kaji Arkale", "published_at_timestamp": 1465251642}, {"objectID": "373673980", "question": "Since working on the Star Citizen project, what would you say has been your or the most innovative contribution that has impacted the game so far.", "answer": "Gaige Hallman: Good question.Eric Kieron Davis: Very polite.

Because I've been given a lot more responsibility to start taking my own direction I think, and trying to improve things that don't actually exist yet.So within the past month I've been working on clothing system on 2.4. While all the code guys handle the implementation of it I've been working on the 3D aspect and making sure the art fits together and works well within the game.

My question is, have you been in discussion with former colleagues from your Origin or wider afield and has this influenced your thinking on your development strategy for SC? I ask because one of the truly enjoyable aspects of some of their games have been around player economy and socialization (thinking SWG particularly).", "answer": "Well yeah, no, absolutely! So when I started this I ... obviously Ultima Online's one of the original grandaddy's of MMOs. It was ... started development when I was at Origin and I know a lot of the people that led it: obviously Richard Garriott, Lord British; Star Long; and quite a few other folk too. Had a fair amount of discussions in the early days. A long time ago subscribed to Star Wars Galaxy, and World of Warcraft, and all the rest of them.Yeah a lot of that kind of shaped what I want to do with Star ... it's essentially I look at what other things do and I go \"Oh, I like that bit\" or \"I don't like this bit\" or \"I really would like this kind of experience\". That's usually why I make games: I see something that I would like a certain way and there isn't a game out there that delivers that experience so I go and make it. Which is really how Star Citizen came about because I felt like the technology was ready to build this immersive world that I've always wanted to adventure around in.And I have to say that the social aspects, which I think you are asking about here, is one of the things that's really compelling. And even in what you can see right now, in the early stages of the SC Alpha, where really you can't ... we don't actually have that many systems of gameplay to support the social aspects, but people are just doing it anyway.So someone get's stranded out at a location and they'll go into the chat and say \"Hey come rescue me\". We haven't ... we don't have any ... we are to have support where you'll have a rescue beacon, and it show up on a map, and you can pay people to pick you up, and stuff like that. But right now it's all completely informal, emergent behaviour that everyone that's playing is doing. So people are rescuing other people. Or people are getting together and crewing up ships and going off and getting involved in encounters and adventures. It's really cool.So we actually have a big focus of the world and system we're building. We're building play for people that want to play solo, definitely, right which is that old Privateer model. But there's a huge focus on how we build gameplay that is that \"group of friends experience\". Where you and your buddies are flying a Constellation or you're out there interacting with other players, like someone needs help: they need to be refuelled, or rearmed, or saved out in space.All these kind of things we are building systems to do that. We have a pretty exciting next stage communications platform that will unify what we are doing on the web and also what will happening in the game. It's still ... it's in the early stages and we're working on it so it's not going to debut right now, but I definitely think that's going to be pretty cool. Where you'll be able to organise your groups and chat groups and friends and organisations. And be not in the game or in the game and have full presence in the chat. So not the very rudimentary, basic one we have in the game now. We're going to basically unify it ... well the platform.So you could arrange on these chat setups for, and your groups arrange groups, and say \"Hey let's get together for a game. Let's go adventuring together tonight at Xpm or whatever\", and later on you go in the game and it's already set up. You set it up offline, maybe on your PC or maybe on one of your mobile. But it's all the same kind of chat so you could even have someone playing a game and could see, say on your whatever, your Android or iPhone, and you could be chatting with some people playing a game in the same chat thing. It's all ... and you'll see where they are in the star system. So we're going to have a pretty cool ... there's a lot of focus anyway ... the upshot is that we're focusing a lot on social aspects, getting people together ...I mean I'm definitely always impressed every time we have an event because all these people say \"Hi, this is my new best friend and I only met him through Star Citizen!\" And it really ... yes we're a computer game that everyone sits in front of a computer and interacts, but you're meeting real people on the other end. So we're thinking about how we can get people to work together, coordinate together to achieve things. As well as just have the \"lone wolf\" gameplay. And then of course we have the bigger organisation \"meta\" gameplay as well planned in there.So I'm thinking when all of it's in, which obviously takes time because it's wildly ambitious, it will be ... I think, socially, probably our goal is to be something that people would look at and say \"That is how you implement social engagement in your game\" and I think if you look at what we do with the web side of things, and how we do it on the Community side, that you can definitely see that that's our objective.And those were some of the big take aways I thought were really cool: the emergent behaviour and the social aspects that came out of Ultima Online. You see some of those in EVE but also World of Warcraft: I mean there's vast amounts of people that made friends, got together in World of Warcraft that would never have met otherwise. Which is totally cool.So yes! We'll look all of those and use it to inform what we're going forward and doing.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 84", "source": "https://youtu.be/MMlaecTbKjo", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Vapor O'ura", "published_at_timestamp": 1461622118}, {"objectID": "373674790", "question": "For SQ42, just how much interaction will we have, if any, with our wingmen or crew before battle scenes, or on the deck?

We're really working hard on proper interaction. Not just verbal but facial the way people look at you, the way they respond to you, the way you talk to them will reflect the way they talk to back to you. Also just having a system where the people have actual jobs on a ship and jobs are wherever they are.So if they're a mechanic you can find them working on the ships at certain time, and then they'll walk to the mess hall, and they'll have food, and if you walk up to them they'll look up and they'll even look at you, and you can ask them a question and they'll respond or they may be busy. It's all these things. I know we actually invested a lot of time and a lot of the tech in the AI side and you probably heard the word subsumption used. Which is basically our system for making our characters come alive. And the way you talk to them and treat them is also the way they'll respond to you. Whether it's socially on the ship or whether it's out there in flight and so forth. So when you're out there there will be a lot of back and forth and you are, the idea is we really want you to build relationships with your wingmen and the crew around you in the game.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 80", "source": "https://youtu.be/zvm1jW_Xp_8", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Jaricho Wren", "published_at_timestamp": 1459202407}, {"objectID": "373675230", "question": "What type of work is being done to increase the server population capacity? Should we expect to see 24 or 32 player instances in the near future?", "answer": "The answer to that is absolutely and I think if you've been watching some of the chatter on the recent PTU and releases and what's going to be in 2.2 it is going to be 24 players. So we've been working hard on optimising the areas so we can scale I think I mentioned before, the biggest issue we have is just the overhead that the ships have because they're very complicated they have multiple items that have all this functionality, they need to talk to each other over the network, they're attached to ships. So a ship isn't just one entity, in the case of a Hornet it can be fifty or sixty in the case of a bigger ship it's a lot more than fifty or sixtySo they're very heavy processing wise in the server in terms of just simulation and network traffic. So in general that's more of the limiting factor which we've been working on. So we're refactoring a lot of things to make it much more smart about when it has to update, and all the other things. And that ties into the work we've done in the past on this other system. We've been doing a whatever you want to call it; a network LOD and an update LOD that scopes depending on whether you can see things, how far away they are, whether they're acting, whether it's another player, whether it's relevant to you.So hopefully all that stuff, helps increase the load that we can do and we're doing things, we're pushing more and more into multiple cores and multi-threading to be able to do more physics processing at the same time as we're doing more entity updates in the simulation. Part of the result of that is moving to more players in Crusader and we'll continue and we're expecting to continue to push that over time to get more and more.We're actually working on some backend server mesh tech that will allow us to mesh a lot more players, in essentially what would be kind of sort of the same instance. But that's a little further along but I think it's exciting so I think we'll be able to deliver probably more players than we were originally thinking in concurrent areas. I think actually there's a question later about that.

So you guys are aware most of the ships now have the local physics grid within them which is a sparse grid that has just local physics world informations so it's a little island, sitting inside a bigger island, sitting inside a bigger island of physics.Steve Bender: Islands in the stream, that is what we are.ST: Well said! So basically what's happening when this happens. So it's only going to happen when you do a pass between the local physics grid and the world grid and going back and forth between them is basically a really tricky for us to deal with. Because it's not only dealing with the play that's going back and forth in-between sending forces in-between. Even trickier is that the bounds for that local physics grid actually exists on the asset.So on the ship itself we built it into the weapon &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; actually ship script so what's usually happening here and is usually one of two things. It's either the code has been a little bit messed up in terms of when you are passing between these things, dealing with transferring all the character attachments and everything and if all of that isn't transferred over you're going to fall through. The other times this happens is when the asset itself has gotten broken in some sort of way or even worse that one piece of that asset hasn't streamed in yet. So that's a big, big problem.Sometimes we will get the mesh in and the local physics grid information does come in. Usually that's what you're seeing in a lot of the PU releases, a lot of the PTU releases we ended up in this situation with a couple of ships. So the way you can kind of tell what's going on is, if happens with every single ships that's probably the code. But if it happens with just one ship well it's probably just the asset itself.These are just normal teething pains when you are trying to work on a physics system like this. Just because there's so many interdependencies and complexity to passing all that data in and out, in and out, in and out. It gets really crazy when there's three levels of nesting of something like that. You've got an Idris, which has a Connie, which has a Merlin. It can get pretty crazy! So just dealing with every single situation with that, it's pretty normal teething pains. So I would say the future plans to make it a little more reliable is just to fix the bugs with it really.

But you'll also have open space travel so you'll be able to fly anywhere in any direction. We're actually adding additional flight modes which I've talked about before, but in the multi-crew release there's going to be Precision which is the low speed flying for landing, taking off, maneuvering, close quarter ships or structures; then there's SCM, space combat maneuvering, which is what everyone knows from AC which is low speed space combat velocity range and you can do pretty drastic maneuvers and not have you pulling too many G's; then we have Cruise which is between SCM and Quantum and Cruise is going a lot faster but then you can't turn very fast and if you did you would be sliding quite a bit but that's really for getting to place quickly when you don't want to jump drive or maybe you don't have a nav point for that; and the beyond that there would be Quantum drive.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 68", "source": "https://youtu.be/FkjfyVDhzNs", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "BloodProof", "published_at_timestamp": 1443477905}, {"objectID": "373681710", "question": "Will there be floating debris fields of scrap metal for salvagers &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; akin to asteroid fields, will salvage opportunities only be spun up after particular battles, or both?

So those are all sort of specific and focused gameplay that we want to do for the salvaging. We think it will be pretty cool for the Reclaimer. Will there be a salvage deep dive document in the future? Well I don't know, we will have to ask Tony that. So the salvage is sort of Tony's plate.  If you've read his stuff or heard him talk, he doesn't know how to do anything but a deep dive. So there very well could be a document on salvage in the future. We generally want to have a design overview of the main roles and game features that you can do in the game. I would say yep in the future, can't promise it will be in the next month or two but that's definitely something we would want to do.

Rather than a mouse control where you'd aim within a grid, the hat would be more of a radial system. I actually got it working, but not in a reasonable time for release.

Since then we've been looking at alternatives, like the look ahead mode, hooking up look-mode to those controls etc.Dan Tracey: Really the basic implementation of that is trivial, hooking those controls up, but it's something that we'd need to provide customisation for etc etc, so really the question is when will the producers have enough time to schedule something like this for the designers/coders etc to tackle.

It's sort of the way things work in real life. You know, if I've got a Colt 45 and I'm shooting at an M1 Abrams, I'm probably not gonna do much damage - and the same sort of thing will be true in Star Citizen. So, depending on... we haven't really implemented armor in Arena Commander yet, but that's one of the things that's sort of stubbed in and will be there... but armor will obviously affect... I mean, we have hull damage but we don't have sort of levels of armor beyond it. So, that will have some impact, and obviously we have the nuance of ballistic weapons versus energy weapons, and obviously in our world they have different setups, so like ballistic weapons aren't really stopped particularly well by shields - so they tend to go through shields - but armor is really built to sort of deflect or stop ballistic weapons. Whereas energy weapons are deflected and absorbed by shields, but armor isn't so good against them. And also there would be the size, and the scope, and the power of the weapon. So if you have like I said, a hand gun, and you're trying to shoot a hornet with it, you'll probably be a lot less successful than firing a Bulldog repeater.Umm, so, I would say \"yes\" to that answer!", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 36 (2014.09.08)", "source": "https://youtu.be/a7GBgc4GxAQ", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Vaster Holtex", "published_at_timestamp": 1410213823, "time": "20m22s"}, {"objectID": "373683330", "question": "As the Aurora can dock in space with a Constellation, can the Constellation jump to another system with an Aurora or two docked and take them with it, allowing non-jump equipped Auroras to be transported to another system?", "answer": "That's a pretty inventive idea. Definitely thinking outside of the box! But I would say no. So, we don't let you, when you're docked to another ship, we do not let you fly, and definitely don't let you go into a jump point or something like that. Basically what happens is you have to move your two ships close together and then you bring them in and dock, and when you're docked you'll sort of hang in space and you can transfer between the ships. But you're not really able to be performing space flight or space maneuvering.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 30.

We have something that we call \"Nanny Mode\" internally here, I think we'll call it G-Safe or something, where the flight control system will ensure that when you start to pull to many g's, it will back off on your velocity, so your turn rate will still be high, but your actual rate of speed will slow down so you don't pull to many g's.Then we've got a couple of the other modes which we have. Com-stab which we talked which is control stabilization, which is a little like traction control in space.They're all there, so it's up to you as a racer. If you put the safety modes on, you won't be able to push the edges as much, so I would expect that the harder core racers would really push the edge, maybe turn com-stab off and the g-safe off, then really push it and try to ride the edge of not quite blacking out, and also sliding around things.Like if you ever see a real professional racer on a road course, they're always using drift and everything as they're coming around turns. We're definitely gonna have that in out racing in space, and you can see that we did a video update a couple of weeks ago that showed some of the different modes and the drift, so I think that will actually be quite fun for racing, and make it cool.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 23.

[Already announced as pushed back]", "answer": "Chris Roberts: This upcoming module is being pushed back because I want to have the proper back-end system so originally when I was first speaking about this modular approach. But to do this I knew I\u2019d need to use the existing CryEngine net code because proper back-end is a big engineering job and we\u2019ve been working on it for quite a while. So I thought that would be alright but the further we got, the bigger audience we got, we\u2019ve thought we\u2019ve got 200,000 people now who are eligible for the alpha.<br/><br/>Just supporting that online requires the net code that\u2019s not built for that sort of volume of people would require  a lot of work and we\u2019d have to do a lot of maintenance. Of course this work will never be used in the final game, so that sort of deal is like a bad, bad use of resourcing and so I\u2019d rather delay this so I could polish it a little bit and we can get a proper back end with the systems and instance servers and all the rest of the stuff working. Then we\u2019ll be able to test the game in a proper set-up and hopefully that will help reduce the\u2026down the road but also it\u2019s going to allow better activity between the modules.<br/><br/>The way it\u2019s going to work and should work is that in the back end multiplayer, you\u2019re allowed to chat with your friends and the organization and say \u201chey, let\u2019s go\u201d.  To do all that, really requires a proper back end and the systems, so it\u2019s definitely worth doing rather  that than putting out something tacky out first or the other option which is to do a single player shoots some ships down but that doesn\u2019t seem very appealing to me. I\u2019m more interested in testing the game with all the pilots flying around.", "title": "Star Citizen Interview: Chris Roberts On Building A Space Simulator For The Ages", "source": "https://gamingbolt.com/star-citizen-interview-chris-roberts-on-building-a-space-simulator-for-the-ages", "type": "article", "user": "Ravi Sinha", "published_at_timestamp": 1391558400}]
