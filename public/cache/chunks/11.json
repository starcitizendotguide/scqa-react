I'll try to cover the major points but apologies if you feel I have left out something important.<br/><br/><b>When will the servers be stable? At the end of beta. Why not before? Because we need to finish making the rest of the game first.</b><br/><br/>When a game is being worked on as a closed alpha the focus is on feature and content development. Stability and bug fixing take a back seat and only issues that would hinder further development are addressed. This may sound an unprofessional way of doing things but the idea behind it is to try out ideas as quickly and cheaply as possible. That allows the developers to find out which parts of the game's design work and which need revisiting. There is no point spending time bug fixing a feature that may change or even be completely pulled from the game at any time. Development will continue with the game in this semi-broken state at least until all features and content have been locked down. The game then enters the beta phase of development where bug fixing, optimisation, balance and polish are at the forefront. Ideally no feature work happens during beta but there's almost always some last minute changes pushed in.<br/><br/>SC of course is open development, so while the focus in alpha is still on trying out different ideas, we need the game to be stable and functional enough for backers to test it and give their feedback. The key word there is \"enough\" which of course does not mean perfect. It is important that we strike the right balance between bug fixing and further development: too much bug fixing and development slows, too little and we don't get enough feedback or the bugs hinder further development.<br/><br/><b>Has CIG got the right balance between bug fixing and development?</b><br/><br/>The problem with determining whether a build is stable \"enough\" is that we can only look at how stability affects the playerbase as a whole, i.e. the average. There will therefore be some lucky backers who experience far fewer crashes or other problems than average while there will be some poor souls for whom the build appears a bug-ridden crash fest. Ask the lucky players if we have the balance right and they might say, no the game is stable enough and we need to focus more on expanding the game. Ask the unlucky ones and they might still say no but want us to stop working on new features until all the current bugs are fixed. Very few people are going to say yes.<br/><br/>As a rule of thumb, before releasing a patch to Live, we try to make sure it is at least as stable as the previous Live release. Some patches may be more or less stable for particular play styles than previous ones but, overall, stability should get better from patch to patch. Of course sometimes things don't work out how we'd like and average stability will end up not as good as it was on the previous version.<br/><br/><b>Why aren't we fixing the server crashes causing 30000 disconnection errors?</b><br/><br/>We are. It only seems like we aren't because, regardless of the cause, all server crashes result in clients getting the same 30000 disconnect. This disconnect happens because once the server has crashed the clients suddenly stop receiving network traffic from it. They then wait for 30 seconds to see if traffic will resume (incase the server was stuck on a temporary stall or there was a short network outage) before giving up, returning to the front end menus and showing the disconnection error. During these 30 seconds clients will see doors fail to open as well as AI, terminals and other entities become non-responsive. Backers sometimes mistake these symptoms as a sign that the server is about to crash, and you might see in-game chat saying a server crash is incoming, but the truth is that the server is already dead. It is an ex-server. It has ceased to be. If we hadn't nailed it to its perch it would be pushing up the daisies. (In-game chat only continues to work because that is handled by a different server.)<br/><br/>When a new patch is being prepared on PTU, new builds are available for download almost daily. Once DevOps in ATX has pushed the new build up to the servers and made it available for download they then monitor the build for the first few hours, often working late to do so, looking for anything to indicate a problem that needs dealing with immediately. For the next few hours people play the game, uploading their crash reports, submitting to the Issue Council, responding to feedback forums, etc. Server crashes are all automatically recorded to a database. When the EU studios wake up, Technical QA look through the uploaded client crashes and recorded server crashes and make an initial assessment of which are the worst offenders, based on how often they happen and how soon after joining a game. Server crashes almost always go to the top of the pile, purely because they affect more people than individual client crashes. Jiras get created and passed on to Production. Production do three things here: first they send the crash Jiras to the Leads for triage, second they confirm priorities and which crashes QA should try to reproduce or otherwise assist with, third they flag any particularly bad crashes with Directors for priority calls incase additional people need to be reassigned to try and ensure a speedy resolution. Meanwhile the Leads triage the crashes making sure they go to the right Programmers on the right teams. Then the Programmers investigate the bugs, often working with QA to find as much info on the bug as possible. Most of the time Programmers can commit a fix the same day but sometimes it might take a day or two longer. In rare cases it can take a couple of weeks to track down the problem and come up with a fix. In very rare cases the bug is a symptom of some deeper flaw that will require restructuring some system to work a different way, can't be done in time or without significant risk for the current patch, and needs to be added to a backlog to be scheduled for a future release. As ATX comes online Community and DevOps publish their reports on the previous build from information gathered over the past day. Production kicks a build with all the latest fixes and meet with QA, Community and DevOps to make an assessment on whether the new build is likely to be better than the last or whether additional fixes are needed first. Production pass their recommendation onto the Executives who make a go/no-go decision on the trying to push the new build to PTU that day. If yes ATX QA and DevOps start working their way through a pre-release checklist that takes several hours to complete. When LA comes online EU Programmers may hand over any issues that were specifically for LA teams or that EU teams were working on but are unresolved and would benefit from continued investigation after EU has finished for the day. When ATX have completed the pre-release checklist, and if the build has passed, the cycle starts again.<br/><br/><b>If we are fixing the crashes why do 30000 disconnections keep happening?</b><br/><br/>Between every quarterly release we change a lot of code. Some of it completely new and some of it merely modifications to existing code. Each change we make has a chance that it may contain bugs. We're only human and all make mistakes from time to time so each quarter there is the potential for having added a lot of new bugs. There are processes in place to reduce the chances of that happening but some always slip through. Once a bug is discovered it needs fixing. Sometimes a fix doesn't work. Sometimes it only fixes the crash in some cases but not all. Sometimes the fix itself has a bug in it that can cause other problems. One of the things we see quite a lot is that once a frequent crash is fixed one or more other crashes will start appearing more often. That happens because the crash that was just fixed was blocking the other crashes from occuring as much as they otherwise would have. As mentioned above there are also crashes that can't be fixed immediately and need to wait until there is more time to fix them properly or until some other planned work is completed. Eventually though the majority of the most frequent crashes get fixed. What we are then left with are the really rare crashes, the ones that only occur once every month and we don't yet have enough information to fix or reproduce them. One of these rare bugs isn't going to make much difference on its own but a hundred such bugs would be enough for at least three server crashes a day.<br/><br/><b>If we can't make the servers stable why don't we provide some kind of recovery?</b><br/><br/>It has been suggested that providing some kind of cargo insurance could prevent players losing large sums of aUEC when their server crashes mid cargo run. I believe this has been considered but the potential for it to be abused as an exploit is clear. Until that problem is solved cargo insurance is unlikely to appear in-game.<br/><br/>Another suggestion is to add some kind of server crash recovery. The idea here is that when a server crashes, all the clients would be kicked back to the menus with a 30000 as they are now but would then be given the option to join a newly spun-up server that has restored the state of the original from persistence. This is actually something we're hoping to do but it requires more work to be done on SOCS and full persistence before it can happen so is still a long way off.<br/><br/>There have also been other suggestions such as clients or servers saving out the game's state in local files but these aren't secure or it would be a temporary solution and a waste of work to implement and maintain that could be spent working on the proper solution instead.<br/><br/>For now the best option is for us to continue to fix crashes as we find them and hope that servers are stable enough for most players to be able to test the game.", "question": "Server issues 30k", "user": "SeiraWolf", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/50259/thread/server-issues-30k/3034939", "title": "Ask The Devs", "type": "spectrum", "published_at_timestamp": 1589760000}, {"objectID": "1383549080", "question": "Will they go back to releasing design documents, and if not, why?", "answer": "Todd doesn't think so - they've changed the way that they develop things and are also at a different stage in development. A lot of the time when they're talking about features like Law, or features that they're currently working on, they have an internal document of what they want to achieve, which Todd would call almost like a one-pager, which has the very high level beats of what they think they can hit for Tier Zero, and what they need to hit for Tier Zero. The previous documents used to go through Tier Zero to Tier Four, so there were a lot of things that would happen when they get to Tier Zero and release it, and then it would change, thus making Tiers One through Four completely moot. Todd's more than happy to talk about what they're working on, and how they're moving forwards, and sharing those design ideas with the community, but he doesn't think that the deep-dive documents are worth putting out any more. Chad adds a more programmer perspective, saying that the sync-up between programmers and design would often reveal technical considerations that hadn't been fully considered until they started implementing the design, as well as more design questions that hadn't already been answered by the document. So now it's \"more Feature Teams\" and programming is working closer with Design, allowing them to be more agile with said design to the benefit of all, which is to say that the programming side gets an earlier view into the design process to give feedback, and design has a better source of information in terms of what's possible and what's reasonable within a certain amount of time. This reduces expectations on the programmers too who would previously be looking at the potential Tier Four implementation and seeing that they've got to hit that long-term goal that they're not confident that they'll do anyway, which might then affect how the programmer does the implementation. As such, switching to this more agile method has felt like a good set of changes. Jared adds that the design documents worked against agile development, and worked against one of the biggest benefits of Star Citizen, which is having the Live Game Environment where they can put out iterative things, see how they work, and get feedback. He uses an example of the Proximity Assist that will come in 3.7, as an iterative improvement to the Hover Mode that was released previously in 3.6. So their more agile development allows them to adjust between their implementation of Tiers, to create a better system that wouldn't necessarily be possible with the long documents because they would either lock them into something that would deny them the feedback of the community, or be what was the case for most of them, which was that they became wildly inaccurate.", "title": "Star Citizen Live: All About Development", "source": "https://youtu.be/wENuiIcPK10", "transcript": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/d1e27o/a_summary_of_star_citizen_live_all_about/", "type": "youtube", "time": "43m07s", "published_at_timestamp": 1567797154}, {"objectID": "1352581790", "question": "Is there anything you can tell us about the future of MobiGlas?", "answer": "It's kinda similar to what they're doing with the ship MFDs.

We currently have Client-Side Object Container Streaming (CSOCS), where if a cup moves away from a ship, the cup streams out for the client which helps to improve the client's FPS, but is still on the Server. The next evolution of this tech is SSOCS, where if no-one's near the cup, the Server doesn't need to know about it (so the cup is streamed-out for the Server just as it was for the client, boosting the server's performance). The problem with SSOCS is that, if it's a ship that was damaged that's going to be streamed-out, it needs to be brought back to the Server with the same damage it had before, which is where the next evolution of persistence is (where things like damage states persist regardless of whether the entity is streamed-in or out). There are a lot of teams working on it, to get both the engine and persistence working, and to do that they will have to change how and when persistence is stored. With the current persistence model, if a Player owns a cup then the cup has persistent info because it's bound to the Player, but an AI is not bound to a Player but to the Server. This is where global persistence comes in, where the cup is saving its persistent state (damage, health, who's inside it) to the Server's version of persistence info. This will allow for things to be streamed-out on each dedicated server, to unroll an entity and then bring it back. Further out, we'll see stuff like Server Meshing where maybe the cup is owned by a different Server, so then the persistence info of the cup has to be stored to the global universe, rather than to a particular Server - this is much further away, so right now we're just looking at SSOCS and Server Persistence. Just like with CSOCS, this will change a tremendous amount of game code, and most engineers are focusing on this development. As the tech becomes available, game coders (like Mark Abent) will have to change the system to expect that the cup is no longer (potentially) on the Server, so they need to figure out what needs to be saved in the general persistence so that it \"comes back\" as it was before it was streamed-out. The Ping System is a good example of what gets heavily affected by this. Right now with Ping, you can ping out and find things outside of the radar, but if the cup could be seen by a Player and it's streamed-out by both the Client and the Server, and the Player pings out and is expected to know that there's something there, the Player won't get that info (because it's streamed-out and there's nothing to communicate that it would be there). So now the coders have to change the Ping code to run a \"service\" - code that can read the persistent data - so that the Ping could as the service if there's anything within the area that's being pinged, and then the service checks to persistent entities that are streamed-out and what info is attached to them, so that it can be relayed back to the Player, who could then fly to that point of interest and find that a ship, which was there but was streamed-out, has now been streamed back in. Sean Tracy adds: SSOCS will have a dramatic effect on performance. Last quarter they hit a serious limit for content they can load on a Server, to the point where it's really hard for even the Devs to run their Servers locally, just because of the amount of RAM they need. So there's no more content they can shove in; they need SSOCS. And work on SSOCS doesn't stop work on Features, instead tasks are periodically fed to Devs, although SSOCS does take precedent over any Feature by far, because of how badly it's holding them back. A lot of the problems with performance, both Client and Server, is just too much stuff being held in memory, which SSOCS will help with. Also, the Persistence Team has laid out a calendar of when they want to get certain things in, which isn't a direct \"on this day this\" but more just a \"we're here on the schedule\" and \"when we get to this point we'll have to talk to these people to do these things\", and then when that's done they move forward on the schedule. Having done CSOCS already, it's helped them to know exactly what's going to happen with SSOCS so that they could plan pretty rigidly, to the point where SSOCS is more like game construction than game development.", "published_at_timestamp": 1558137330}, {"objectID": "1725ba1ed1c837_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The ARGO SRV can Quantum Travel while towing.

It's split into two parts - upstream and downstream.<br/><br/>First to clarify what an actor is - in the current game that is any humanoid actor (either controlled by an actual human player or by AI) running around in the verse. It does not effect ship or weapon networking, they're different enough that they use different systems (though they do all have some common elements/strategies).<br/><br/>Upstream refers to the communication from the local client up to the server:<br/><br/><ol><li>Currently the actor movement is client authoritative - this means that when you press the 'W' button locally your client moves you forward and then sends the new position up to the server, which then replicates it to all other remote clients. This has a number of issues, not least it being a nightmare for anti-cheat as well as it having an effect on perceived lag (most notably, if someone else has a poor connection you see them teleporting about a bunch).</li><li>We are moving actor movement (and indeed their entire state) to being fully server authoritative - when you press the 'W' button locally that is bundled up in an \"action\" and sent off to a component called the Actor Action Handler. This component replicates this action up to the server and it is processed on both - the local client and the server will move you forward (hopefully the same amount, there's a whole lot of code to make sure it does) and the position from the server is then replicated to all clients, with remote clients accepting it (same as before) and the local client validating against it (too much divergence and they are moved to where the server thinks they are...or rather were, since by the time it's got back down he's likely moved on, we reset and then rerun the inputs since the frame we were reset to).</li><li>There are a bunch of new complexities with all of this - we have to do our best to not miss any actions, we have to take into account the time it takes the actions to get up to the server, we have to appropriately deal with any divergence between client and server and we have to have methods of mitigating lag.</li><li>The most obvious user facing improvements to this will be improved validation and slightly improved experience when facing players on a poor connection. For the validation, since the server is fully authoritative and can tell us exactly when something has diverged we can better cope with that - the previous method was very susceptible to poor server framerate or network latency, manifesting most obviously with the mobiGlas flicking open and closed rapidly, or ladders being a bit clingy (those changes have already made it back into the main branch actually, expect them in 3.5). For playing with/against players with a poor connection you will see them teleport around less, though on their own clients they will rubber-band more as the server corrects them.</li><li>For the most part, think of this as a change that has some minor improvements but is mainly just a precursor to the next part.</li></ol>Downstream refers to the communication from the server to all remote clients:<br/><br/><ol><li>Currently to smooth out actor movement on remote clients we artificially inject a 250ms delay into all their movement processing - being able to see a quarter of a second into the future allows the various movement and animation systems to give a better visual result, and having that buffer mitigates the problem of lag spikes.</li><li>For us, this is not really a sustainable solution. Everything being 250ms out contributes to the game feeling laggy and is an overwhelming factor in the \"movement and shot delays\" you mention.</li><li>The plan is to reduce this rewind amount significantly to something sensible (hopefully around ~2 frames instead of 15), with improved dead reckoning and state processing helping to cover over the visual impact of this.</li><li>Another factor of this will be remote client patching that is already implemented but needs some tweaks (and bugfixing...) before going fully live. This means, for example, when I kill someone on my client I can temporarily take control of that remote actor to immediately play a hit/death reaction. Since you tend to be looking directly at someone when you kill them any latency on them playing the reaction is very noticeable, so removing the need for the hit to go up to the server and then come back down reduces the perceived lag significantly. Obviously, if the server disagrees with you (you didn't actually hit/kill them) then it will be undone on your client, though this should only happen in cases of extreme lag or cheating.</li></ol><br/><br/>We have been planning and working on this rework for quite some time, and have confidence that it should improve things significantly.", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/50259/thread/different-tick-rates-in-different-places-with-serv/1930029", "user": "elec", "title": "Ask The Devs", "type": "spectrum", "published_at_timestamp": 1550103643}, {"objectID": "1a02caeef1729a_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The Apollo's medical bay can hold more people than a non-medical focused ship (outside some of the capital ships mentioned above) and its modularity allows it to heal in ways the vast majority of ships can't.", "published_at_timestamp": 1533679200, "question": "What's the advantage of the Apollo in comparison to a medical bay you can find on ships like the Carrack?", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/16705-Q-A-RSI-Apollo", "title": "Q&A: RSI Apollo", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "96ad2c008faa9_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The Prospector has its 128 SCU capacity spread across its multiple saddlebag containers, but cannot hold the full 128 SCU at a single time and must detach these containers to keep collecting material.

We showed some ecosystems in what was \u2026 we called the \u201cHomestead Demo\u201d but it had rocky, mountainous areas; open desert plains ... we\u2019re planning to have a lot more ecosystems and variety than we showed in Homestead. The concept is that they would have their different challenges in terms of longer term weather, even wildlife or resources that would be there.<br /><br />So it\u2019s pretty exciting and we\u2019re building the toolset to allow the artists and the designers to have fun and \u2026 You watch Star Wars and you go \u201cOkay, yeah, it\u2019s Hoth. It\u2019s the ice-snow planet. And Endor\u2019s the forest moon or whatever. And we\u2019re definitely going to have different planets, moons even, that would have those sort of different feels. And in some ways maybe have more of a variety of ecosystems because obviously Star Wars tends to be very like \u201cHere\u2019s the snow planet. Here\u2019s the forest planet.\u201d And I think that would be cool.<br /><br />And I think longer term we\u2019re hoping to make it so there\u2019ll be gameplay and challenges related to the actual ecosystems themselves. And we could even see a point where you could crash land on a planet, and you have to get a distress beacon out, and you\u2019ve got to survive for a little bit of time before someone comes and rescues you. And so you got to maybe hunt some wildlife or find some water to drink or find some special type of mineral that you need to do to repair your ship.<br /><br />Tony Zurovec (TZ): Yeah, but that\u2019s the important thing, which is that the environmental variability is not just cosmetic: it directly benefits the types of gameplay that we\u2019ll be able to have the players engage in. Everything from reduced visibility from snowstorms, sleet, fog, etc.; impaired navigational capability from sources of radiation: all of these different types of mechanics come together and allow us to present new and different challenges.<br /><br />We can force the player out of their ship to actually walk or drive across the surface of the planet because there\u2019s something that throwing off too much interference so their ship, in close proximity to the planet, can\u2019t actually navigate how it normally would. And a variety of things like that.<br /><br />So all of this variation on the planet is not only going to present you with a lot of just visually different looking scenarios and stuff, but it\u2019s going to greatly increase the types of gameplay that we can put out there.<br /><br />Todd Papy (TP): From a player\u2019s standpoint I think of this as \u201cnatural gating\u201d or \u2026 versus traditional MMOs or something like that where \u201cOh, you\u2019re not level eighteen you can\u2019t go there.\u201d Like this is our natural way to gate players of \u201cOh, you don\u2019t have the right equipment to go into the extreme cold or extreme heat or radiation or something like that.\u201d  So it\u2019s a way for us mess \u2026 to take tools away from players that they might be used to, whether that be the radars or affects the way sensors work in their ships, or even like the flight.<br /><br />CR: And I would say that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re doing all this systemic approach, right? So, in terms of you as, say a character or a human being in the role that you are playing, like you need to breathe oxygen. So if there isn\u2019t an compatible atmosphere you would need to have an environmental suit. Or perhaps you\u2019re in a place that has too much radiation: you need to have some shield from that. Or there\u2019s really bad wind storms so \u2026 sand storms ... so during that you\u2019d have to find shelter.<br /><br />So we\u2019re trying to make it systemic so that when we build the environments it just works. As opposed to we just program specific actions based on you being in this area but not with the right equipment. The equipment allows you to survive the environments. Essentially. And so you should \u2026 if you\u2019re going to explore you should probably ...<br /><br />TP: Have the explorer suit!<br /><br />CR: Have the explorer suit, have the land vehicle: all the things that let you get down close because, like Tony said, there may be case which was what we were showing or hinting in the Homestead Demo was that ...  the idea is there\u2019ll be areas you\u2019ll not be able to fly your spaceship to so you may have to get out on foot or get out and use a ground vehicle. Or sometimes you\u2019d have to land and take shelter. So there\u2019s all these great sci-fi where you see the approach, like Aliens, and they\u2019re going down to Hadley's Hope and they go through the buffet of the atmosphere.<br /><br />So we\u2019re all going to try to get all those aspects in there and really give detail to the different locations. So even though we may not have a billion procedurally generated moons or planets, we\u2019ll have a huge \u2026 we\u2019ll have a very large amount of actual planets and moons that have a really well constructed set of environments and ecosystems that should be challenging and interesting to explore.<br /><br />TZ: That\u2019s the part that\u2019s most interesting to me which is unlike, even more so than in space, we\u2019ll have the capability at the local scale to be able to change the environment such that, yeah, scanning is more difficult, or force you out of your ship, or finding an area - planets are enormously large things and so since we\u2019re not going to basically just have the magical button that you can push and all of a sudden things are revealed to you - it\u2019s like if you\u2019re talking about things hidden in plain sight then just the sheer size of these things. And then once you start to add in forests and mountain ranges and snowstorms and fog and rain \u2026<br /><br />CR: Well you think how long it\u2019s taken us to explore Earth, and there\u2019s probably some areas \u2026<br /><br />TZ: They\u2019re still finding pockets of oil and everything \u2026<br /><br />CR: Right.<br /><br />TZ: \u2026 else.

With a single skeleton per sex is there a way to project a large, strong, character as well as a smaller, less physical type?", "answer": "Omar Aweidah: Yeah. I mean... That's an interesting question. Let me think of a way to respond to that. Okay, so you have two characters, they're two different heights, they have a series and sets of animations right? We make a character super big and be able to make him buff and huge, we have to say, \"Okay what's the benefit of that?\" Well you get to have a little bit more variety, but now this character is going to start clipping through his seat that we had in something else or his holster might have to be pushed out or something like that and then there's some art considerations and time considerations. So, do we want to have bigger characters? Yeah, Of course, but then if we start to do much larger characters, what is the downfall and what's the benefit and do they outweigh each other?So what we're doing right now is we're getting a lot of this portrayal through different clothings and armour times. Like the heavy armour, I'm sure you guys have seen the concept, maybe if it is out or isn't out I'm sorry, I apologize, but it's huge and massive and that's a good way to symbolize your presence. You want to be like really skinny and frail and maybe a quicker character and you want to be able to zip around in combat, you might be someone who wears the light armour with maybe a higher end jetpack right? There's ways where you'll be able to customize your character, now talking about scaling up the rig and all that kind of stuff, it creates a lot of difficulties. So we decided that maybe providing you with better animations would the best thing to do rather than providing you with less quality of animations, but more variation because then they have to be universal and work together universally.Once we find, once we start getting more into the game and seeing how the players work and seeing some of these ships and all this kind of stuff and maybe we're like \"Well if we do this, we might not have to do that\" and then all of a sudden there's this new way by using these bones to expand our characters now that CryEngine can take more bones then maybe that's the best way to expand characters and we're like, \"Okay, perfect, this will solve our problems\". So really it's just time, so right now we kind of want to nail down what we have right now and get that tech looking good and I guarantee you there'll be a large amount of variety and personalization into your characters, but on their most basic physical skeletal level, that's not really the priority right now. I think there'll be enough variation as it is, but down the line I think when it becomes an issue, than we'll of course and address and respond to that issue.Adam Wieser: Yup, sounds good.OA: Sounds good.AW: Good answer.OA: I hope so.AW: So we'll go onto the next one.OA: I don't know what I was saying.

I've noticed in the 2.0 demo that within a few seconds of the pilot taking controls that the ship was airborne and flying off.", "answer": "Well I mean you'll get into the ship, you'll sort of turn it on and you'll get the HUD booted up and then after thrusters have spooled up you should be able to fly it. Longer term we're actually working on the stuff that will be a bit more involved. So having an interactable cockpit where not just having the screen interact with but turn switches off and on and so more old school ships you may have to click stuff off and on and some more modern ones maybe just touchscreens or holograms.We'll probably make some of that more involved later on; so there's some new stuff that's coming with our usability and item refactor that will allow us to sort of look around the cockpit and I think you've seen a preview of what we're doing with the interactive screens but that will all extend to also: \"Oh look here's a switch I can turn a switch.\" So interact with buttons and everything in cockpits. So you get in and turn your powerplant on and turn your HUD on and those kind of things. We will probably add some of that.We don't want to go too crazy on it because we want to make this game accessible. We're already fairly... I know some people think we're a very simple game but if you compare us to say even the past Wing Commanders, I've done the Privateers, we've got a lot more knobs and dials you turn, modes you switch between and I mean just moving between the flight modes that's already four flight modes where in Wing Commander there's just one flight mode.So we're adding this extra complexity for when you get into the game you can really get the most out of it but we also need the kind of basic \"Oh I'll get in my basic starter ship, it's an automatic, I don't need to tweak anything and I can just easily fly and take off\" and then as you get more into it and you want to sort of get better performance or more control then you would go into a more manual state. So that's kind of like the analogy between having a car that's automatic and a car that's manual. Right now our startup sequences will be short to allow you to get into the action but longer term we will make it more involved for the bigger ships and make it generally cool.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 70", "source": "https://youtu.be/ezrghcBRcSk", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Dreada", "published_at_timestamp": 1447716094}, {"objectID": "373680570", "question": "As a producer you get to see an in-depth look of the game and how the people work on the different systems.

What would yours be?Eric Kieron Davis: Oh, man, I was thinking about this a lot. Well, if you watch the \"Get to Know the Dev\" or whatever it was ...DV: \"Meet the Dev\"EKD: ... I talked about my background is animation, so I actually got out of college thinking I was going to be an animator.DV: [holding up a bottle] Is this yours or mine?EKD: It's yours. So I spent a lot of time learning the craft of animation, getting a degree in acting, just all the things you need for a good solid performance of a character, and so that was actually the path I was going in. So for me what I would love to do, or what I would have loved to have done, what I would dig into (probably too much) is the animation side: performance and characters and just conveying a story, because I love telling stories.DV: So this is your leading role as a Senior Producer?EKD: Pfft!DV: You've been cast as Senior Producer, and this is your script?EKD: Yeah and I'm going to act someone out. So that would be me. What about you?DV: Probably the lore or writing aspect. Given that I've got a background in publishing and writing I would love to be a project managers or just oversee how the writing develops. Creating that kind of mythos is incredibly interesting for me. I have a deep seated love for traditional printed media. There's something romantically classy about holding a book in your hand and knowing that this is something that you had a hand in putting together. But I actually like what I'm doing here: being able to interact with developers on design and engineering, it's different from anything else I've ever done.

So one of the things we are constantly looking at is ways we can reward people for subscribing because it obviously helps us create all this community content. I do think one of the differences between SC and say other crowd funded games or other games in general is we are able to be much more open with our development and share a lot more. That takes quite a lot of work, a lot of effort is actually spent on various video shows, we did behind the scenes information that we share, jump-point magazine and all the rest. I do think it helps for everyone interested in it to take the journey along with us. I don't think we would have been where we are without that involvement without the community and that involvement is really made possible by the funds subscribers kick in because that is what we use to fund a lot of the community like the video department and all the stuff that we do for that is all completely funded by subscribers the pledges that come in outside of that are really all used for development of the game and really the community interaction is in the hands by what happens with the subscriptions so we really appreciate anyone that subscribes they're doing a great service not just for other subscribers but for everybody on the project and even people that aren't even backing the project because a vast amount of information gets disseminated every week and it's largely because of the support of the subscribers. So yes we want to do more to keep you going and coming back  because you make a big difference and so we're looking at doing things and talking about doing a sort of monthly live stream for subs and we're also talking about doing more, I don't know kind of fun flairy things so we've kind of done some subscriber flair but just do some sort of elements or the way that you can fly a glaive if you're a subscriber for a certain amount of time. Not a glaive, a sycthe but those are all things that we're looking at. Those are all things that we're looking at doing to make the subscribing experience more rewarding without disadvantaging anyone on a game basis cause one of the things we said we didn't want to make was subscribers a better class of citizen inside the game itself. But I think it's fine if they get some cool flair they get access to behind the scenes content before everyone else because they are paying for us to have the time to do all that content and at the end of the day it;s better for everyone anyway so we will trying to figure out things to make you guys feel special and thank you for what you do for us.

Will we be able to throw a few NPC into our multicrew ships when Arena Commander 2.0 goes live, or is that something that will come in the future?", "answer": "So, that will definitely come in the future . In Tony's outline of what we've been doing on the social/persistent universe, he outline's when we're going to bring AI into the Planetside environments with Subsumption which is a sort of a higher level AI system that we have that runs the daily lives of the AI and allows them to get up in the morning, go to their job, go get lunch somewhere, go back to their job, go home, go to sleep, etc. So, Subsumption and a few other basic AI things need to be finished off so we can have it run universally around the place so it can work inside zones, inside ships flying. So, that's not going to be for the very first release of multicrew but it will hopefully be a few releases after that. We'll definitely have AI going about their daily lives in the universe or in the multicrew test large world map, hopefully not too far after multicrew. We'll definitely have AI that you will encounter even with the release of multicrew so there will be PVE opportunities as well as PVP opportunities in this big soundbox map we're going to give you guys. There will be a lot to do but having actual specific crew that can work on your ship will not be part of that initial release, that will be a longer term thing.

It is so different from a Designer. I'm enjoying it, it's completely different. I'm really loving, I like the communication aspect of it.Vincent Sinatra: Yeah. Yeah you're really good at communicating. Really good at communicating. I got an inbox full of your communication.RV: So I love that and I love facilitation. So basically making sure the team is taken care of. going to everybody making sure they got everything they need \"Hey what's up what do you guys need?\"VS: Backrubs. Regular backrubs, come to Randy.RV: Nice to know my numbers you may have saw on the bathroom wall thanks.VS: That could be a good and a bad thing.RV: So i'm really enjoying that but what I want to improve on though. I really want to get the ships pushed out. In a better timetable, I know we're, we push ships out and we're letting you guys know when ships are hitting. And each ship is its own little special snowflake. So it's been hard to nail that down because each ship has its own mechanics, each ship has its own features.VS: Then there's those features that's tied to each of the ships. That need to be pushed out stuff like that. Like you said the shields and armour balance that Callix and everybody has been working really hard on.RV: Callix just finished that audit for the shields.VS: Just finished that whole audit for the shields.RV: And you had to do all the testing too.VS: Yea I had to all the tests. Trying to get all those out would be really good and help give us more a final picture of what the game's going to be like, eventually. With each ship that comes down it's alright but that's just a small piece of the greater puzzle.RV: And that's the thing. The audit you just worked on is part of something bigger too because we're doing, we're redoing doing some of the shields and how they work. Just cause it's going to help optimise the game overall.VS: And how lasers affect the shields, how ballistics affect the shields.RV: All that stuff is just being taken into consideration. So the design's changing a little bit. And it's changing for the better and it's changing to make sure that players are given the proper feedback they need. As well as it has all the functionality necessary things it has to have. Shields are just crazy integral to the whole thing I think as a game. Especially for dog fighting.VS: Especially for dog fighting. Well I mean it's hard to balance the ships against each other when that system isn't fully fleshed out just yet.RV: Where you around still when they had the Constellation and the Hornet bug?VS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was one of the ones, the Hornet and the Constellation were using the exact same shields.RV: That was crazy.VS: That was a fun one.RV: There's so many things with shields.

But they would all be NPCs 'cause we don't really want to have unauthorized PvP on planets, 'cause that wouldn't be that much fun for a lot of people. But we're gonna make it richer for people.In this particular example right now, I would say probably not. Because if it's a matter of paying attention to cargo or some other person gets on a ship unseen and goes onto another ship, I don't think we're gonna get to that level of fidelity at the beginning. But it's a pretty cool goal We're still debating the mechanics when we're on planet side.Like if you want to follow another person or you want to, like say you make a person of interest, how exactly is that gonna work? Can you follow them leaving from the bar and follow them over to the landing pad as they get into their ship, or do you just get a notification saying that they're about ready to leave for space and you'd better get to your ship to leave.So we're still going through a little bit of that, those mechanics and deign stuff, but we definitely want to make the environment, the first person stuff, cool.Like there's a whole environment of people going about and doing stuff. You can get into encounters. You can get into a fist fight in a bar and stuff like that, which would be pretty cool.I don't know about sneaking aboard a Bengal carrier, but I will keep it in the back of my mind.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 25.

Most games have some kind of tutorial element either incorporated into the first few missions or as an out of game option.What do you plan for Star Citizen in this regard?", "answer": "Well, good question. You're going to have it very soon, The Dogfighting Module is essentially that.It's the first iteration of Arena Commander, which is the in-fiction gamesimulation software that all pilots can use to practice, to train themselves. You don't have to be fighting against other players, you can be fighting against AI, or just flying around to learn the controls. And ultimately you could do some e-sports with it, have a competition.So really Arena Commander's in there to do a lot of the practicing, but in Squadron 42, we're also setting up a way to break you in on the ships, show you how to use them, in the first few missions.Basically, under the fictional context, you've mustered onto the ship, it's your first couple of missions out as a pilot on the front lines, and you're flying a slightly different ship than you may have trained on, so your wing leader's saying \"this is what you do in the Hornet.\"But we didn't really want to do really boring tutorial missions in Squadron 42, because that always feels like busy work. We'd rather get you in there and get you into the action pretty quickly. Which was very much what Wing Commander did. I think in the very first mission of Wing Commander, you fought some Kilwrathi. Not very tough ones, but right on your first mission.", "title": "10 for the Chairman Episode 17 .

So the multi-crew ships won't be in the very first release of the dogfighting. That will be a later release, mainly because there's a whole extra level of network complexity with multiple people running around the ship, and we've got to simulate the physics separately.That's all stuff that's in development, we're working on it right now, but it won't be ready for prime time by the release. So our focus or dogfighting 1 is the single-seater ships which would be primarily our test case is the Hornet, but also the Aurora, the 300i, the Cutlass, and the Aurora--sorry, no, the Avenger, would all be the ships that we would be focusing to have out, ready for dogfight v1.Not all of them are going to make it 'cause there's a huge amount of assets that have to be built. Yes, you have them in the hangars right now, but you don't have all the damage states and all those bits. We are working on those, so we have quite a lot of people working on all the parts, but our approach is, on the dogfighting module, that when v1 is ready to go, we're not going to hold it up because we don't have every single one of those ships. But as soon as they're ready, they'll be patched in.So the likelyhood is the Aurora is probably going to be there for dogfighting v1, as will the Hornet and hopefully the 300i, because those are the three most common single-seater dogfighting ones. Then the other ones will be more about \"will they make it in time,\" and if not, they will come in a few weeks later.So hopefully that answers the question. I think if you've got an Aurora, you're probably in luck so to speak.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 08 (2014.02.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/wE_xZdeakEw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Brendan101", "published_at_timestamp": 1392677901}, {"objectID": "373685890", "question": "Will there be a way to improve efficiencies with equipment, jobs, tasks, and general actions within the game? In essence, will there be a leveling-up system where we can improve our ability to mine resources, haggle prices, fast travel, detect other ships, etc through man hours (experience) to unlock new equipment, areas, and quests/missions?", "answer": "So that's kind of a two part answer because this is not a traditional MMO, there is no leveling it's not like you start at level one and you'll work your way up to level 20. So a lot of it is to do with your skill set, but then again equipment and things that you've got help you in doing these jobs and tasks, so I think doing things like being a better miner will involve going mining, doing it, learning the skills so to speak yourself, actually doing it, not learning it as in I've gone from level 1 miner to level 5 miner, and having the right equipment, so you'll have to buy the equipment, upgrade your equipment, you know maybe go to some specialty place that does 10% better or 20% better equipment, so it's a combination of your actual player skills, you as a person , and then also the equipment you're using will be our version of leveling-up, there will be some stuff where perhaps, you wouldn't be able to operate certain items or equipment without the right license, you would have to maybe do something like a driving test. So in today's world you can't just drive an 18 wheeler truck, you have to have a license to do that. So we may have something like that. But in general, the leveling tasks will be a more real world based. IE based on your skill and the equipment you're using, not based on an arbitrary roleplaying level. So I hope that makes sense.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 06 (2014.01.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/NcRxuvQT3Ew", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "daDuke Fische", "published_at_timestamp": 1390598024}, {"objectID": "1140485adc55b5_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Update on Galaxy\u2019s Base-Building Capabilities", "answer": "<p>Hey everyone,</p><br/><p>I realise my previous comments may have given the wrong impression, and I spoke too soon on this topic.
