I'd be thinking of something like circular space stations, or space stations where the ground just 'continues' up a wall(Inception style),or space ships where on one deck the direction of gravity would point outwards, so the hull would act as the floor. How cool would it be to look up and see people 'hanging' from the ceiling doing their normal business? Speaking of circular gravity, are planets going to be basically enormous localized physics grids, or is there more to them? If so, can you explain a bit about how they're going to work in that regard?", "answer": "Sean Tracy: Alright so these guys are always sneaking two questions in aren't they? There's like a main one, but oh by the way,Forrest Stephan: 20 for the Developers.ST: Procedural planet something right? No and it's cool, I'm so...FS: It's such a cool question, you can see why it spawns more questions because...ST: Yeah I'm super happy that everybody is so into the planets because that's gonna be such a huge unique point to Star Citizen anyways.FS: Right.ST: So the first question really is about localized physics grids and using them in a more unorthodox way. We've done this internally a lot actually.FS: Yup.ST: You can have a lot of fun with the physics grid. Doing a circular space station is very much possible so that way you can have a localized direction of gravity all throughout the localized physics grid which is quite cool. The other thing, again this is something Chris Reign had worked a lot on is that we've got a sparse voxel representation of the physics grid meaning we can shape it how we want. We give the system a model and it gets as close as possible to this particular piece of geometry. Now the higher poly the geometry is, the more expensive, the more difficult that check is to make, but absolutely we've done this kind of stuff internally.FS: We've even messed with magnetic boots.ST: Grav boots, yup.FS: So, yeah.ST: I think we actually took them out of the build for a little while because the animations looked so weird on them.FS: Yeah, yeah, but that's the thing...ST: We'll be putting those right back in. So not only will you have the localized physics of say, just like he's talking about like a circular space station or something like this, but you'll also be able to magnetically connect yourself via your magboots or whatever.FS: Which is probably super helpful...ST: To pretty much..FS: On the outside of the ship right? To get around, especially for the bigger ships.ST: Sure, totally. It's also kind of fun.FS: Yeah it's super fun.ST: I mean it's a neat thing to mess around with, just like he says somebody is going about their day to day business and they're hanging upside down from you or something like this.FS: Yeah, yeah.ST: But yeah that technology lets us do all this kind of work. Speaking of circular gravities, are planets going to be based basically enormous localized physics grids or is there something more to them. There's a lot more to the planets. One of the tricky parts again and I think I talked about this in another 10 for the Developers is that we can't possibly store every single piece of physics collision on the server all the time, right?FS: Right.ST: So this is something that we've gotta generate on the client side at runtime somehow. So there not big physics grids essentially. They have their own gravity, it's completely implemented independently of a physics grid. Uses the same concept I suppose, but it's not a physics grid entirely. It would be far too large and it's not even close to a granular as what we even need.FS: It's different than when you enter a ship for example right where you setup your boxes and everything.ST: Exactly, it's very, very different.

It's either a box or you can eve do a circle.FS: It's a box, this is the gravity, this is the ground.ST: And then everything is going in that direction, but yeah it's a little more difficult to do on a planetary scale, but it's not a big physics grid, it's... not to be condescending at all it's a lot more complicated unfortunately than that.

So far we do not but we do have the, we did the design the insignias for the medics and so we might, it could be a possibility of just slapping that texture on.WW: I mean I think there's been discussions about having some customisability, and the textures being able to decorate your armour in certain ways. Definitely a good option would be to have that Red Cross insignia or whatever the version is in the universe is, so you can roleplay as a medic and hopefully people won't shoot you or i'm sure a lot of people would try to wear that armour and pretend they're a medic so they won't get shot but then go around shooting other people anyway.JL: Right.WW: Which is really bad don't do that!JL: I don't think we'll have like Starcraft their medics are like white, but that's just for visual cue, but in real life a lot of the medics in the field they wear the regular BDU's and they wear the regular gear that a regular soldier would wear, right? Just because we don't want the medics to stand out. So they might have a patch on their left arm I think? But they don't look necessarily any different.So well i'll address a kind of, i'll segue ways into another question so i'll save that for later. We're planning on having our marines very modular like our ships so we could easily just swap like a shoulder piece out but like a medical insignia on it. So it could be in the works, not currently cause we have a lot more important stuff, but it is a cool idea.WW: Yeah, yeah. Taking a look at what would make an armour set better for a medic. Like maybe they have more smaller compartments on the suit, it would just be a general armour that could hold smaller things like medi-pens at the sake of carrying around more weapons. So you're giving up the weapons slots to carry more medi-pens maybe that would be...But it wouldn't have to be medi-pens because of how flexible the systems supposed to be, it would just be that size storage.So it will be interesting to see how it develops and giving people the flexibility to kind of design the armour they want to wear.", "published_at": "2016-01-11", "published_at_timestamp": 1452554872, "question": "I'm hoping to be a battlefield Medic in game...as I understand it, the differing armours types each have their own loadout maximums(similar to ship hardpoints).

How have the ship pipeline and development/balance process changed since the original ship packages were put on sale? Did those changes, if any, change how the ships and the lore involving those ships have been developed since then to account for balance those ships with other ships that have been introduced after the first batch?", "answer": "Eric Kieron Davis: So the question is ... [laughter] ... From the beginning right, from the beginning of making ships, from the beginning of the idea of what Star Citizen would become, has that process changed? Now, do we do things differently developing ships, maybe from the lore side? And maybe there's only a few people here who can speak to the original, but I think at the same time how's changed? Or has it change? For the better or how's it going?Forrest Stephan: I think the lore side is quite similar only we have more writers obviously and we get better fleshed out ideas earlier on; we've got more designers so we get more designs earlier on. Previously, obviously, we started with running preproduction, production at the same time; and we started from scratch with no company. These ships, we had to build these pipelines for how the ships work as we were building the ships themselves, which explains a lot of the reasons we go back to the Connie and go \"now that we've got it figured out, let's revamp it a little bit and do it right\". Probably, initially we've seen that a lot of things, is it compatible: the original Constellation is a perfect example, we got the ship going, we wanted to get it out there but \"okay wait a minute how do the escape pods actually come out of the ship?\"; when you lower the elevator \"wait a minute do I really want to only one person to be able to get into the ship at a time, maybe I want three\". So these are things that are part of the evolution process and pipelines in general, you get it going, get it started and then you have to use it a couple of times and then you figure out what works and what doesn't work and then it continually evolves. I think with design as well, one thing that we absolutely learned is how important it is to get design and the literature as early as possible; and as much fleshed out as possible because it significantly helped and it significantly saves time. And spending that time at the beginning saves a lot of time at the end.EKD: To speak to, because I'm at six months I think, so I haven't been here since the original; but what I was really excited about with the Endeavour , the most recent one, I felt like, and I know we've done this with a lot of ships recently, that was the first time I saw everyone that needed to get involved, get involved really early. We're doing that right now on a couple of other ships but I was really excited because I got to sit in those meeting that got everybody involved: Tony, and Ben; and the key stakeholders from the beginning. It wasn't like \"hey we've got this far down the ship concept and we never showed Bill over there, we never showed this guy, we never even showed the writers\". It was kind of cool to see that one come together and all the ones we're starting to do now it's got this level of polish from the beginning so when we're getting into these phases and we start developing that ship it's like \"yep!\"FS: And the goal is to get it in ... we've learned the most important thing is to get it in the game as soon as possible.EKD: That's coolFS: Even if it's just shapes. Get it flying, get it moving. See what works, see what doesn't work. And not try to build an entire ship from scratch and then get it in the game. But build the ship up very simple, what we call \"white box\" which is more like proxy-based, and then get it in where it's functional for design to start balance and testing. And then they can already be balance and testing while we're actually doing the final art and then we're just swapping things out as we go. And then we start with the white box phase, which is again just the proxies. And then we move onto the grey box phase, which is like the Constellation during our previous GamesCon demo, and that's like the ship is there, you see it; it's not final but it's pretty close and you can visualise what it will look like. And obviously we do our final pass which is our pristine version.Calix Reneau: Context is everything in making these artistic decisions: how this thing should feel; how this thing should behave; what it should look like. And we've gained all this experience from creating Arena Commander; from creating all these ships that are flyable. And the combat and the flight behavior and all of that; we can see what the game is like: just load it up and play it. So it's the same thing: that informs our decisions, that informs how we want to make the thing grow, and [turns to FS] to your point of getting it in as early as possible, we need to see what it is in order to see what we want it to be.[General agreement]FS: That helps; we barely had a game. You could fly around. I remember the first demo I ever saw was Chris showing me the Hornet on a landing pad and you could kind of fly it around but we didn't have all these game modes back then. So now we have all these game modes so we can throw these ships in at a very early stage and see how does this ship handle against a swarm of Vanduul ships: Scythes and a Glavie.EKD: The ship pipeline has gone through a lot of changes but I almost feel like that just very natural.FS: It's very natural.EKD: What you had from the beginning, like right now if we made an RSI ship we might be able to steal pieces from previous ships. You didn't have that when you started the pipelin; you're making everything from scratch. It's like doing sequels of movies and stuff, I already got ...CR: Iteration!EKD: Exactly!FS: It's about evolving and not doing things from scratch. And a lot of times it seems we're doing things from scratch but really we're evolving.EKD: Totally.Adam Wieser: And from the lore perspective too a lot of the stuff that you guys are talking about, they've done a lot of the heavy lifting before for this. Dave and Will and I ???, with Chris and Ben involved in that too, setting those guidelines, putting the ideas or our thoughts into the Corporation Matrix or in certain places so designers, artists can go in and look and see exactly what the intention behind all those and form their design to it.EKD: That's great!", "published_at": "2015-10-19", "title": "10 for the All-Stars: Episode 01", "source": "https://youtu.be/lkaYT3_vXWQ", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Chaplain", "published_at_timestamp": 1445291582}, {"objectID": "373681110", "question": "Will voice comms be openly audible in open, public spaces like bars (ie. can I listen in for intel) and will it be possible to overhear voice comms when carrying out EW activities in my Sentinel or Herald?", "answer": "Yeah, I mean if we have VOIP which we do plan to have and we're going to have it diegetic so it's in the universe so to speak.

Uh, and this kind of, uh.Travis Day: I don't think it was a very good question.EKD: Oh.TD: We have to, we have to resolve this.Both: [laughing]EKD: How do we tell.TD: I was just kidding.EKD: We're going to do it right here. Example. Role play it, role play it. Uh, that is a great question. And, and this goes back to some of our other questions about the soft skills of the job. And the communication portions of the job. Um, it is very important I think to, to help everyone understand that their ideas matter, their opinions matter. What they have to say is totally important. Um, and I think Travis actually talked about this earlier when it was... How do you have that, that professional debate, where you can ultimately come to a compromise. So, for me - at least how I would try to resolve this is understanding what they're both looking for. Right? Honestly one of the best tools of our trade is getting in the same room and helping us all hash it out. Because in, in this industry, we're all professionals, right? We may be making entertainment and maybe be really passionate about what we're making.TD: And generally too everybody involved, I've yet to meet a person that's super super selfish.EKD: Yes.TD: So everybody is really in it. They just legitimately are having an argument because of what's best for the product. Which is the best argument.EKD: The best argument you could possibly have. So you're already starting off with strong, in the right way. So, helping them come to a compromise is now your goal. Helping them come to an understanding that whichever one is right is also your goal. So getting them in the same room, helping them guide that conversation, giving them both a platform to speak out whatever it is. Make sure all the key stakeholders are there to hear all the sides. And then the hope is to walk out of there - and that's one of the things us as producers try to do when we're helping guide a meeting - is to walk out of there with a set solution that we all feel good about.TD: Yeah.EKD: We may not feel great about it. Especially, like you mentioned AragornBH, that it's hard to tell somebody, great idea but we're not going to use that idea. But when you're all together and you've come to a compromise. Honestly, it's not that difficult. Again, they're professionals, we're all professionals, we're all adults. And we all understand that you know, \"Okay, I got what you're saying, I still would like to do mine, but that does sound the best for the project, let's move forward with that.\" It tends to resolve itself through just simple guidance, communication, and getting the team together to come up with a good plan.TD: I think what Eric said is exactly how you approach solving a problem that has happened, a conflict that has happened. The best problems are the ones you don't have to solve. I think the example that he's giving here is probably, when I listen to it I hear the situation is kind of like... That's something that maybe before could have been completely eliminated just by having like more clearly defined roles and responsibilities.EKD: Yeah, absolutely.TD: Because these two guys apparently were working on the same thing and had a competing method, going for some amount of time before we had to sit them down and talk with them.EKD: Absolutely, absolutely.TD: Which would be us making a mistake anyways. Because that would be a producer's fault, for having two people working in parallel.EKD: On the same thing, that's a great point. I think what we came to here is a symptom of a more root problem. That root problem is establishing clear defined roles for each person on the team. I am going to jump around what you just said. Once everyone kind of understands it. It's totally okay to have opinions about what everyone else is working on, but also respecting each other enough to know, \"Alright thats your field of expertise, this is how I've done it for many years in the industry. Here's my perspective..\" But they're very clearly defined that this is that person's role.TD: Yeah. We've had a lot of success with establishing clear ownership on different pieces of the game. Even pieces of features. That's the thing everybody should understand, everybody has opinions and actually a lot of people on the team, like Zane is a great example. Zane is super dedicated, Zane spends an amazing amount of time working on his art. And he will be the first one to walk up and ask you, \"What do you think? What could I do better? How could this be better? What's it like to play with this. Did you guys like this thing I did or not?\" So everybody is very open to feedback. I think everybody just needs to have ownership and then they can run a nice little operation.EKD: I love that last point too, about Zane. And that's pretty true with everybody. I think even as producers, right? I'll bounce something off Travis, be like, \"Does this make sense? This is what I am going to do, this, this, this.\" It gives you just another perspective to improve. We want to make a really cool product for our backers and for our subscribers and just for people that want to have a great experience. That's what we're all fighting against each other for, right? That's ultimately what we're doing.

This can take the form of denying an area of the game to other players, controlling the economy, or just generally causing havoc. What are your plans for the Star Citizen universe to accommodate the lone freelance miner caught up in the madness?", "answer": "There are a couple of things that make us a little different than the games I think you're referring to perhaps like Eve online. First of all the player base is only ever going to make up at most 10% of the population of any given place, and what's happening in the economy etc, so in terms of being able to dramatically affect an area or economy, it's going to be pretty hard. You may be able to have an impact, but even the largest player group in a given area will make up less than 10%. The other issue is, because we have such high fidelity, we can't have too many people in one particular instance, like in AC the limit at the moment it's only 8 people, with 1.0 we'll have some new tech that we've made that allows much greater player numbers in one instance, but even with a best case scenario at the moment of 50-100 players, there are only so many people that can be crammed into one instance. Matchmaking will help limit these things, like say an organisation might only be able to occupy a certain portion of an instance, there will be slots reserved for friends of other players in that instance as well. It won't be a case where a thousand people can get together and control an area anyway, even if they fill that instance, there could be another instance of the same space that matchmaking might put you into because you're unrelated to whatever activity is going on there. If you want to be more PvE than PvP, the contextual matchmaking will put you together with other NPCs that might attack you rather than players filling the pirate role. There are places where you'll be beyond the PvE/PvP selections, where there's \"no law\", but if you're after quiet trading without players hassling you you'll have the choice to steer clear of those areas. We still want organisations to have AN effect on the economy though, there will definitely be things they can take over and control, but not allow them to spoil other's fun. I'm a bit of a dreamer here, but I have a good feeling about the balance that we've worked out, and we can and will continue to work on that as time goes on.

On a planet we can doing a sort of large-scale battle for conquer an enemy outpost or a city?", "answer": "Okay, so you should not be able to fight anyone at any moment on any location. There will definitely be areas planet-side that will allow you to get into some level of combat - sometimes against NPCs, sometimes against other players. We are going to have sort of a brawling melee mode, so potentially we may have areas where you're not allowed to whip out your gun, and if you do, you're in trouble and you'll get put in jail or kill by the local police. But you may be able to involve yourself in fisticuffs in a bar and that may not be so bad. It'll sort of all depend on the rules and laws of the different environments and locations. But generally we kinda want to make certain areas of the planets safe, so that was I think in an earlier part of the game - pardon, not the game! part of the questions! FatSoDa asked about like \"well how's the single player area gonna be?\" and when you're down on the environment there will definitely be areas that will be sort of designated just for you, where there will be NPCs and stuff but you wont run into other players, and there will be other areas that will be player areas. So you'll definitely always have some safe areas and safe zones normally when you're down on a planet. Maybe in the case of like a really risky, dangerous pirate outlaw place, you know... I wouldn't call anything \"safe\", but it would be safe from other players, but maybe there'll be a thief trying to jump out on you and hold you up at gunpoint to mug you or something.And then on planet-side, having a large-scale battle for conquering an outpost or a city... not, err, definitely not for v1.0. Longer-term it definitely would be something there could be a discussion about. But there certainly will be battles for persistent items or elements, actually out in space, so like an asteroid base, or a space station, or... definitely areas that players will be able to fight over themselves, in terms of trying to control their own and stuff. So that's it, and at some point we may shift some of that down to down on the planet and see how we go from there.

You can have people on your crew, and then you are part of the organization, and you've got a full crew of NPCs.So in that manner, you could think that there would be NPCs who would be fighting on behalf of organizations, but it's not like NPCs will be coming up and asking to join an organization by themselves, if that makes sense.Player pirate clans may have NPCs as part of them, but that would be because they were hired by a real player pirate to have some crew on his ship or something like that.", "published_at": "2014-04-14", "title": "10 for the Chairman - Episode 16 .

Or will the public transportation system make such services obsolete?", "answer": "Yeah, I mean we're actually looking for ways that people can run their own businesses in the game. So obviously taking cargo around, someone says \"Hey take this piece of cargo,\" or even \"Take this ship from here to here for me because I want it over on this planet,\" is something to do. I think that actually we'd like to find a way that people could even transport people around in a way that makes sense. There will be big cruise liners and stuff, and there's obviously a public transportation system that we've already promised and will be in there. But it would be nice to have a version where someone could have a ship and take some people from one planet to another planet. Partly it would be fun to have someone running a cruise liner, I don't know. Maybe it's a bit over--It would be like Murder on the Orient Express maybe people could get up to stuff on the cruise liner, it would be kind of fun. But we're gonna try and have roles for people to do all sorts of jobs in it and one of them would be transporting people.", "published_at": "2014-02-10", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 07 (2014.02.10)", "source": "https://youtu.be/-y0GQV_Bx4U", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Grisu", "published_at_timestamp": 1392073473}, {"objectID": "1264206001", "question": "One of the things most difficult about developing space sims, even in the days of Independence War, was accurately modelling space physics. What is it like these days, especially when you have something as big as Star Citizen? Is it more or less the same or is the task more difficult than before?", "answer": "Space physics are actually much simpler than atmospheric physics because all the elements you to figure out in the atmosphere, you don\u2019t have to figure out in space. Physics is not that difficult. Sometimes I think people sort of misunderstand a level of intelligent flight controls that defines space physics, who actually try and fly your ship around and fires all these weapons, and it\u2019s not very easy for any of us to do. Specifically in most games it distracts them a lot.<br/><br/>In Star Citizen, we\u2019re simulating everything correctly. We basically have a flight computer which is sitting between your input on the joystick and control services and to the thrusters and engines of the ship.", "published_at": "2014-02-05", "title": "Star Citizen Interview: Chris Roberts On Building A Space Simulator For The Ages", "source": "https://gamingbolt.com/star-citizen-interview-chris-roberts-on-building-a-space-simulator-for-the-ages", "type": "article", "user": "Ravi Sinha", "published_at_timestamp": 1391558400}, {"objectID": "373685990", "question": "Will we ever be able to play as the other alien races?

There's a whole bunch of people out there who think we've got too much to do already. So that won't be beginning, but that is definitely a long term plan because I would really want to see that and I think it would be fun to play as a Tevarin or a Xi'an or a Banu, and if we do that we probably would also create a companion single player experience like Squadron 42 but for the race.
