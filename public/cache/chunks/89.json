The 89th UEE Navy Logistic Support Squadron were the only military forces in system at the time of the attack. They managed to hold off the Vanduul for two days, allowing much of the planet's population to escape at the cost of nearly the entire squadron. Naval reinforcements arrived on the third day to engage the full Vanduul fleet, but they were unable to hold out against the onslaught. On 23 July 2884, after heavy casualties, Crion and the rest of the Caliban system were lost to the Vanduul. In honor of their sacrifice, the 89th Squadron was retired, earning them the nickname \"the Lost Squad.\" This battle marked the last time a Kingship was spotted by United Empire of Earth (UEE) forces until the Battle of Vega II in 2945.</p><br/><h1>PRELUDE TO BATTLE</h1><br/><p>Small Vanduul raiding parties first began attacking Caliban in 2739, during the latter years of the Messer era (2546 - 2792). While the initial raid sparked fear in the system's inhabitants, causing a brief population drain, the skirmishes were largely casualty-free. As raids continued to occur at a steady rate of between two and five per year, the UEE installed a small naval presence along with system-wide perimeter sensors. The people of Crion saw this response as inadequate; political activism spiked among the populace, but the Messers sent no more aid.</p><br/><p>During the fall of the Messer regime in 2792, the military presence in Caliban was pulled away from the system to repress mass civilian uprisings elsewhere. A medium-sized Vanduul Clan launched a raid on the largely undefended system, which claimed over one hundred lives. The newly formed post-Messer UEE government ordered the 31st Battle Group to Caliban to fend off the invasion. Their efforts were successful in stopping the raid from spiraling into something much deadlier.</p><br/><p>Subsequent Vanduul raids dropped down to previously established levels of roughly five per year, finally peaking in 2859 when a single large Clan clashed with the 31st Battle Group in the system's asteroid belt. This was the last Vanduul raid until 2884. By 2870, the 89th Logistics Support Squadron was Caliban's only protection. </p><br/><h1>THE ATTACK</h1><br/><p>At 04:43 Earth Standard time (UST), 7 July 2884, a Vanduul Clan led by a Kingship slipped past the system-wide sensor beacons. Two pilots of the 89th, on patrol near Caliban IV, spotted the Clan. Both of them fired off a distress signal, but their messages were cut off before they could be completed. </p><br/><p>Not comprehending the scope of the threat they faced, the bulk of the 89th mobilized against the invading Clan. Four ships were lost to advancing scouts before the Kingship was in sight. At the sight of it, CO Commander Sylvie Randall made two snap decisions; first, to send out comm drones requesting reinforcements, knowing that it might take up to two days for reinforcements to arrive; second, to retreat back to Crion to organize and defend civilian convoys. It was this decision that allowed over three million inhabitants to escape with their lives.</p><br/><p>By the time the 2nd UEE Naval Fleet arrived, 49 SE Hours later, there was nothing left to do but rescue any remaining people and abandon the system. The 89th Squadron, along with the Caliban system, were lost. It is estimated that over five and a half million people died, though no official numbers have ever been released.</p><br/><h1>AFTERMATH, ANALYSIS, AND IMPACT</h1><br/><p>No attempts were immediately made to reclaim Caliban. Though the Kingship responsible for the bulk of casualties in battle returned to Vanduul space soon after its victory, UEE forces held off on moving in until casualties could be assessed. The UEE announced in 2891 that there were no active plans to retake Caliban until the Vanduul threat could be fully neutralized. In 2945, military strategists began to discuss possible future campaigns into the system to rout the Vanduul encampments. </p><br/><p>Historians believe that the decades of Vanduul absence in Caliban, combined with a thinly-spread military, poor system-wide sensor maintenance, and an incomplete understanding of Vanduul intentions were what led to the invaders' decisive victory. Though the Tiber, Virgil, and Orion systems had already been abandoned to the Vanduul, military strategists did not foresee an attack of that strength on Caliban. The 89th Squadron was there in full force, but one squadron was not enough to stand against the firepower of a Kingship. In honor of their sacrifice, Squadron 89, redubbed the Lost Squadron, was officially retired from the UEE Navy.</p><br/><p>Vanduul Harvesters are actively consuming what is left of the Caliban system.

Bookmark anything on your computer, and it works in browsers as well. Makes him much faster doing his work. Back when he was at ID, there were nested folders within folders. Being able to bookmark folders is awesome, and it\u2019s free. For 20$ you get the pro version where you can make nested folders within your bookmarks. Second tool is KUtools for Excel. It does a lot, but Bryan uses it for a way to go into a folder and whatever files are in that folder, or hierarchy of folders, it\u2019ll give you all the assets in an excel file.

So, one of the big goals ... we're building a big universe but it's not a universe that's going to have four hundred billion star systems but it's going to have quite a lot of locations like an insane level of detail where you can get down and sort of feel the location you're on or the ship or everything. One of the big things we obviously want to do is derelicts, so derelicts are kind of cool, they're definitely easy encounters to do and yeah, you absolutely should come across that derelict ship and there's some alien like organism. Or creature on it that could attack you or later on when we get space to planet stuff working, you can land down in an area or maybe you've got that Pitch Black scenario where you get attacked by some kind of alien wildlife or animal or something like that. We are definitely going to build some kind of derelict haunted house kind of stuff to put in there with other encounters, more so traditional encounters you can have so that can be a risk.You can go look and explore and salvage this derelict but maybe when you're in there you get attacked by ... I'm not saying Facehugger but the equivalent jumping down from the ceiling or there could be pirates aboard it or there could be nothing aboard it. So, I think we're definitely going to do that, try to have some to give some atmosphere as you can sort of see what we do with Star Citizen, we're really trying to give it texture and atmosphere and make the world feel real. We can definitely do that because we're in this FPS first person engine that we also fly vehicles and do all sorts of stuff so the possibilities are ripe.

We're not going to be doing the typical sort of you know big publisher, blanket the TV commercials, I mean first off. We've been pretty much taking all the money we have raised and putting it into development opposed to things like marketing. Essentially everything we have done in terms of marketing has been completely viral, it's been sort of PR driven and community driven and you guys have actually been the best marketeers for us we haven't been doing banner ads we haven't been doing anything.I would say for Squadron 42 especially at the beginning, we're showing the PC. I don't think we see a massive benefit of doing sort of TV advertising because we're hoping the games going to speak for itself and it will be great word of mouth and we'll kind of go from there and if it's doing well and making us money then maybe we would sort of doing some more traditional marketing to reach some of the audience that we don't normally reach through the typical sort of PR or viral channels that we have been doing. I think we'll certainly at the beginning anyway, Squadron 42 will be sort of much more kind of guerilla style marketing. Maybe there will be one or two things a banner ad or two, who knows.We're not really planning on doing it the full sort of EA treatment because we would much rather put the money into the game to be honest with you.

We've actually got quite a few pretty good foreign language, sort of, made up language linguists or whatever.  The person who was doing the Vanduul language, has worked on quite a few films and apparently he's one of the world's foremost experts on Na'vi....   he's one of the foremost experts on it and a bunch of other things like various Star Trek stuff like Klingon.  In fact, he's the one who coached a whole bunch of people to be Klingons in the last couple of Star Trek's, so anyways, we developed this language which I think works quite well for the Vanduul.  Of course, we are doing the same thing for the Xi'An, and for the other stuff, so that was sort of Dave Haddock, working with the various folks who will be doing that.

Potentially when someone gets killed in FPS you might have a view of another team member's helmet cam. That won't be in the first FPS release but down the line it'll be pretty easy to do. I don't know so much about having a team-leader role where you'd have multiple player's views on your screen, mainly because cryengine isn't very good at handling that, and also you'd be rendering multiple 3D worlds at once which can be problematic with our detailed world. We're definitely allowing people to stream their view live, so you could I guess have those streams open ad-hoc with other systems around you, that's longer term tech we're working on and have planned from the start, with streaming tech inside your client without having 3rd party software. We could maybe even take that and play it back inside a texture inside the game... That could be an interesting implementation actually, just thought of that now. In the long term, yeah, those kind of things are cool. Even in terms of streaming we'll have a traffic cams or something, so you could go to our website and see maybe a few jump points, or terra, or sol or something and it'll be streaming on the site. That'll be kinda cool, and our tech definitely allows for that. We might start having that in AC where you'll be able to see streams of ongoing matches, and longer term we could see that all done inside out web-platform basis.

We're definitely going to have a reputation score for organisations, so obviously the UEE and the Banu, Xi'An etc will all have their own ones. So individuals or groups that attack another organisation (even as large as races) will prompt an uneasy or hostile relationship with them, so maybe next time they're in the same space they could be attacked rather than friendly. I wouldn't necessarily say that would have an effect on the UEE as for the most part I doubt players will be doing these things on their behalf, but as individuals or groups it'd certainly prompt a response from the Banu, any maybe even the UEE.

There's definitely been talk about having nuclear payloads. I'm not sure where that's gonna end up, but...DH: The funny thing is, at the end of the day, it is interesting - I mean this a society where common people can go out and buy really heavily armed... warships (in a nutshell). Fighters and stuff like that. So it's a bit of a different society. Mostly that's just because it's dangerous out there, you know - there are Vanduul, there are pirates, there are slavers, there's all sorts of craziness happening outside that, you know, you'd have to protect yourself.WW: Space is too big to police fully, with a unified force...DH: Yeah. As far as nukes, I mean, specifically that's more of a design thing. I would imagine that yeah, if you're-... you've seen the size of these frigates - they're huge. You would have to use some kind nuclear payload to put a dent in that thing.WW: It's interesting because we have the notion of \"mil-spec\" weapons. Like, when we release a military ship to civilians we say that they don't include everything, so we have this line of there being some technology that's too powerful, too dangerous, or that the military wants to contain an advantage over the civilian population. So that's implying that there is a certain level of devastation that's considered inappropriate for commercial use, and in order to get that, you start having to go to the black market. So, like an off-the-shelf ship made by a major manufacturer wouldn't really have any forbidden tech in there 'cause they wouldn't want to lose their manufacturer license and put themselves long-, wrong end of the log-, wrong end of the-... what the hell am I saying? They wouldn't want to lose their manufacturing license!DH: Yeah. So there is a line. It's just that what that definition of the line is-... 'cause the thing also, I mean, part of the devastation of nuclear weapons is atmosphere. Radiation, fallout, air carrying particles beyond the blast radius and the fallout zone, and all that stuff... which you don't really get in space I would imagine.WW: Yeah, just being in space is awful for you radiation-wise...DH: Yeah. So maybe nukes lose a little bit of their luster? You know, obviously I don't think it's restricted to nukes - I don't think you could try and do an orbital strike on a planet - they would shoot you down in a second.But yeah, so I guess it's a long way around - yes, there's a line because like Will said there's the \"mil-spec\" thing, but what that division is I think we're still sort of trying to figure out. And a part of that is also just with game balance. With Arena Commander there's a huge amount of focus put on making sure that what weapons does what, and is countered by what, and what are it's strengths and weaknesses, and stuff like that. So just getting a basic baseline understanding of what civilian weapons do, then you could figure out what the mil-spec weapons do, and why they're so much more powerful.WW: Yeah. And just like we're gonna have to handle you walking around with weapons on a planet's surface, I think it'll be the same way of like, when you're flying into ArcCorp and you have a nuclear payload missile, we'll have to figure out ways why you're not firing 5 of them off into the middle of the city.

We haven't really been able to do a huge amount of testing between someone flying in Oculus Rift and someone not flying in Oculus Rift. We have sets in all the offices, but the Oculus Rift resolution, even on the high HD set isn't actually that great at the moment, so you are sort of handicapped with the resolution of the stuff comparatively to someone who's playing on a big monitor.But I will say, in the UK, one of our designers is a huge VR fan, so he plays with the Oculus Rift all the time against other people, and he's not the top guy. Now that may be, he may not be very good at flying, or the Oculus Rift may not be giving him an overwhelming advantage.Generally, the nice thing with the Oculus Rift is it frees your head look and you can look around, track targets, and also when you have guns that gimbal, then obviously they'll track to that. But don't forget, the gimbaling of the guns is only as fast as the guns will move and that's not instant.So far, it's not like anyone has put on Oculus Rift and completely dominated everyone else. It's generally been much more down to pilot skill, but I do think that the Oculus Rift gives you more immersion, and potentially could perhaps give two equal pilots an advantage.

For instance, if you went out and you found a derelict, ancient ship floating in an asteroid field somewhere and you go and explore it, you would explore it in first person.You would dock, you would go down, and you would explore it, and hey, we may even have some alien creatures that could attack you. And we'll have other situations where perhaps you would get attacked, like you're down on a more sketchy planet, and some people try to mug you in the cargo bay when you're unloading the cargo, so you have to whip out your laser pistol and defend yourself.There will definitely be elements that will have nice, PvE elements, that will play into the first person shooter side. Which would be separate from what we would be doing for the PvP first person shooter stuff which is more like fighting with other people and boarding their ships.I think it's really gonna add to the color.

They're all going to have different pros and cons. We're deliberately designing things so there is no \"best\" ship. So something like the Caterpillar for instance, if you're more into trying to board a bigger ship to take them over, a Caterpillar is definitely better for that than a Constellation. But also, all the different ships are going to have different pros and cons. So for instance, bigger ships are cool because you can have multiple people on them, you can have turrets, walk around, but bigger ships, just like in real life, won't be able to turn as fast or be as maneuverable as a smaller ships will be. There isn't really a best for anything. There may be a best for this particular role, but I think that's the beauty of Star Citizen. There are lots of different roles, lots of different things you can do. We're very focused on having different roles and functions for the ships, so there will be different kinds of play styles all based on what you want to do. So that's what I'm most looking forward to in the game: To have this whole variety of ships and somebody may just want to be flying single seater ships and focusing on dogfighting, people may want to be multiplayer, co-op, bigger ships doing exploration, or trading runs, or whatever.
