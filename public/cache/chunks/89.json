You know, game server, game client, client does interpolation. So as your ships or your actions move, your actor, so your character and your ship, when you're actually piloting a ship, the client does interpolation about your movements. So it's trying to predict what the server will say. And then the server comes in and says, yeah, that's what it is. And that comes from the network queue. So obviously when we have congestion on the network, it's going to cause some of this. But it's also server FPS, of course, has a very large effect on this. Right. And so desyncs are a combination of factors. Right. That when you see a desync, it's, you know, could be because the server is simulating a piece. And he's back in time a little bit. So he's skipping time steps. Well, he's not skipping time step. It's not the right way to do it. I'm trying to make it simple so we don't go too deep into the weeds. But think about it this way. If the server is not running at a very decent frame rate, then when those frame rates dip, the effect will be some kind of level of desync for certain kinds of items. And so with the RMQ, we're hitting on the stuff that's related to the network transmission. This will help definitely. And with the new metrics in 3.24, that helps us to really hone in on what is the cause of the cost over time on frame time. Where is our frame weight? What resources are being used? What resources are being allocated? So the thing that might not be clear when you look at the game. So the Star Engine is really good at streaming stuff in dynamically and streaming it out dynamically. That's the key feature of the engine. But that also has a certain level of cost. So depending on what players are doing in the game, the servers might be doing just fine. Right. You know, certain areas are just super easy, but then other areas stream in and then they become problematic. And so that's what we're looking at with those metrics is to see what areas and what entities in those areas are costing us the most so that we can optimize the things that really affect those desyncs in that gameplay, literally. So right now, the improvements we're getting there is several engine fixes or optimizations, I should say.

There have been some awesome stories that could be stashed away for the explorers in the deep, dark parts of the Star Citizen universe. Movies like Alien, Pandorum, Event Horizon and Pitch Black. Stories like this help reinforce the vastness of space and just how fragile the players are.", "answer": "Absolutely. So, one of the big goals ... we're building a big universe but it's not a universe that's going to have four hundred billion star systems but it's going to have quite a lot of locations like an insane level of detail where you can get down and sort of feel the location you're on or the ship or everything. One of the big things we obviously want to do is derelicts, so derelicts are kind of cool, they're definitely easy encounters to do and yeah, you absolutely should come across that derelict ship and there's some alien like organism. Or creature on it that could attack you or later on when we get space to planet stuff working, you can land down in an area or maybe you've got that Pitch Black scenario where you get attacked by some kind of alien wildlife or animal or something like that. We are definitely going to build some kind of derelict haunted house kind of stuff to put in there with other encounters, more so traditional encounters you can have so that can be a risk.You can go look and explore and salvage this derelict but maybe when you're in there you get attacked by ... I'm not saying Facehugger but the equivalent jumping down from the ceiling or there could be pirates aboard it or there could be nothing aboard it. So, I think we're definitely going to do that, try to have some to give some atmosphere as you can sort of see what we do with Star Citizen, we're really trying to give it texture and atmosphere and make the world feel real. We can definitely do that because we're in this FPS first person engine that we also fly vehicles and do all sorts of stuff so the possibilities are ripe.

We're not going to be doing the typical sort of you know big publisher, blanket the TV commercials, I mean first off. We've been pretty much taking all the money we have raised and putting it into development opposed to things like marketing. Essentially everything we have done in terms of marketing has been completely viral, it's been sort of PR driven and community driven and you guys have actually been the best marketeers for us we haven't been doing banner ads we haven't been doing anything.I would say for Squadron 42 especially at the beginning, we're showing the PC. I don't think we see a massive benefit of doing sort of TV advertising because we're hoping the games going to speak for itself and it will be great word of mouth and we'll kind of go from there and if it's doing well and making us money then maybe we would sort of doing some more traditional marketing to reach some of the audience that we don't normally reach through the typical sort of PR or viral channels that we have been doing. I think we'll certainly at the beginning anyway, Squadron 42 will be sort of much more kind of guerilla style marketing. Maybe there will be one or two things a banner ad or two, who knows.We're not really planning on doing it the full sort of EA treatment because we would much rather put the money into the game to be honest with you. Like I said if we sold a bazillion copies then maybe we'll double down a bit.

Vanduul is one of the languages, there's many we are working on, but Vanduul we needed for Squadron 42, so in August when I was over in England just after Gamescom, we shot a few days with the actors playing some of the Vanduul in Squadron 42,  and they were speaking Vanduul, and it's very cool.  We've actually got quite a few pretty good foreign language, sort of, made up language linguists or whatever.  The person who was doing the Vanduul language, has worked on quite a few films and apparently he's one of the world's foremost experts on Na'vi....   he's one of the foremost experts on it and a bunch of other things like various Star Trek stuff like Klingon.  In fact, he's the one who coached a whole bunch of people to be Klingons in the last couple of Star Trek's, so anyways, we developed this language which I think works quite well for the Vanduul.  Of course, we are doing the same thing for the Xi'An, and for the other stuff, so that was sort of Dave Haddock, working with the various folks who will be doing that.  We'll be moving forward on that, and you will in the near future, not in the immediate near future, but you will definitely be hearing Vanduul and then ultimately the other alien languages, so yes we've been moving forward on that.", "title": "10 For the Chairman Episode 66", "source": "https://youtu.be/VGTj2iWkS-8", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Sylvok", "time": "2m57s", "published_at_timestamp": 1442269621}, {"objectID": "22b2c5b517f8a_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "No. Weapons and upgrades for the Scythe will likely be especially rare, as few human companies will profit by making them... and there are no Vanduul ports with which to trade.

Potentially when someone gets killed in FPS you might have a view of another team member's helmet cam. That won't be in the first FPS release but down the line it'll be pretty easy to do. I don't know so much about having a team-leader role where you'd have multiple player's views on your screen, mainly because cryengine isn't very good at handling that, and also you'd be rendering multiple 3D worlds at once which can be problematic with our detailed world. We're definitely allowing people to stream their view live, so you could I guess have those streams open ad-hoc with other systems around you, that's longer term tech we're working on and have planned from the start, with streaming tech inside your client without having 3rd party software. We could maybe even take that and play it back inside a texture inside the game... That could be an interesting implementation actually, just thought of that now. In the long term, yeah, those kind of things are cool. Even in terms of streaming we'll have a traffic cams or something, so you could go to our website and see maybe a few jump points, or terra, or sol or something and it'll be streaming on the site. That'll be kinda cool, and our tech definitely allows for that. We might start having that in AC where you'll be able to see streams of ongoing matches, and longer term we could see that all done inside out web-platform basis. You might be able to see next to someone's avatar in the forums if they're streaming at that moment, click and view etc. Obviously not happening in the next few months, but we're actively doing R&D towards that, we're already seeing plenty of streaming on twitch and youtube, so we just want to make that easy and fun for people.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 59 (2015.04.06)", "source": "https://youtu.be/OXpx2C6rFAc", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "[ADT] Gromph", "published_at_timestamp": 1428360934}, {"objectID": "373676410", "question": "If players continuously attack a certain race, such as the Banu, could that prompt a race war between us?", "answer": "Probably not, we aren't going to have \"meta simulation \" programming on a race basis. We're definitely going to have a reputation score for organisations, so obviously the UEE and the Banu, Xi'An etc will all have their own ones. So individuals or groups that attack another organisation (even as large as races) will prompt an uneasy or hostile relationship with them, so maybe next time they're in the same space they could be attacked rather than friendly. I wouldn't necessarily say that would have an effect on the UEE as for the most part I doubt players will be doing these things on their behalf, but as individuals or groups it'd certainly prompt a response from the Banu, any maybe even the UEE. If we watch it, once the universe is live, we'll be game-mastering the universe so potentially we could flare up some border troubles as a result of what players are doing.

There's definitely been talk about having nuclear payloads. I'm not sure where that's gonna end up, but...DH: The funny thing is, at the end of the day, it is interesting - I mean this a society where common people can go out and buy really heavily armed... warships (in a nutshell). Fighters and stuff like that. So it's a bit of a different society. Mostly that's just because it's dangerous out there, you know - there are Vanduul, there are pirates, there are slavers, there's all sorts of craziness happening outside that, you know, you'd have to protect yourself.WW: Space is too big to police fully, with a unified force...DH: Yeah. As far as nukes, I mean, specifically that's more of a design thing. I would imagine that yeah, if you're-... you've seen the size of these frigates - they're huge. You would have to use some kind nuclear payload to put a dent in that thing.WW: It's interesting because we have the notion of \"mil-spec\" weapons. Like, when we release a military ship to civilians we say that they don't include everything, so we have this line of there being some technology that's too powerful, too dangerous, or that the military wants to contain an advantage over the civilian population. So that's implying that there is a certain level of devastation that's considered inappropriate for commercial use, and in order to get that, you start having to go to the black market. So, like an off-the-shelf ship made by a major manufacturer wouldn't really have any forbidden tech in there 'cause they wouldn't want to lose their manufacturer license and put themselves long-, wrong end of the log-, wrong end of the-... what the hell am I saying? They wouldn't want to lose their manufacturing license!DH: Yeah. So there is a line. It's just that what that definition of the line is-... 'cause the thing also, I mean, part of the devastation of nuclear weapons is atmosphere. Radiation, fallout, air carrying particles beyond the blast radius and the fallout zone, and all that stuff... which you don't really get in space I would imagine.WW: Yeah, just being in space is awful for you radiation-wise...DH: Yeah. So maybe nukes lose a little bit of their luster? You know, obviously I don't think it's restricted to nukes - I don't think you could try and do an orbital strike on a planet - they would shoot you down in a second.But yeah, so I guess it's a long way around - yes, there's a line because like Will said there's the \"mil-spec\" thing, but what that division is I think we're still sort of trying to figure out. And a part of that is also just with game balance. With Arena Commander there's a huge amount of focus put on making sure that what weapons does what, and is countered by what, and what are it's strengths and weaknesses, and stuff like that. So just getting a basic baseline understanding of what civilian weapons do, then you could figure out what the mil-spec weapons do, and why they're so much more powerful.WW: Yeah. And just like we're gonna have to handle you walking around with weapons on a planet's surface, I think it'll be the same way of like, when you're flying into ArcCorp and you have a nuclear payload missile, we'll have to figure out ways why you're not firing 5 of them off into the middle of the city.

A lot of the economic nodes (factories) will be NPC controlled, then say 10% might have the potential to be player controlled, that's part of what we'll expect players or organisations could own down the track, perhaps it might become their business more than trading or combat roles. So they'll be available, then over time as things expand, perhaps as a colony becomes more popular or bigger, there might be more slots/opportunities for economic nodes to be created or owned as well.

We haven't really been able to do a huge amount of testing between someone flying in Oculus Rift and someone not flying in Oculus Rift. We have sets in all the offices, but the Oculus Rift resolution, even on the high HD set isn't actually that great at the moment, so you are sort of handicapped with the resolution of the stuff comparatively to someone who's playing on a big monitor.But I will say, in the UK, one of our designers is a huge VR fan, so he plays with the Oculus Rift all the time against other people, and he's not the top guy. Now that may be, he may not be very good at flying, or the Oculus Rift may not be giving him an overwhelming advantage.Generally, the nice thing with the Oculus Rift is it frees your head look and you can look around, track targets, and also when you have guns that gimbal, then obviously they'll track to that. But don't forget, the gimbaling of the guns is only as fast as the guns will move and that's not instant.So far, it's not like anyone has put on Oculus Rift and completely dominated everyone else. It's generally been much more down to pilot skill, but I do think that the Oculus Rift gives you more immersion, and potentially could perhaps give two equal pilots an advantage.

For instance, if you went out and you found a derelict, ancient ship floating in an asteroid field somewhere and you go and explore it, you would explore it in first person.You would dock, you would go down, and you would explore it, and hey, we may even have some alien creatures that could attack you. And we'll have other situations where perhaps you would get attacked, like you're down on a more sketchy planet, and some people try to mug you in the cargo bay when you're unloading the cargo, so you have to whip out your laser pistol and defend yourself.There will definitely be elements that will have nice, PvE elements, that will play into the first person shooter side. Which would be separate from what we would be doing for the PvP first person shooter stuff which is more like fighting with other people and boarding their ships.I think it's really gonna add to the color.

They're all going to have different pros and cons. We're deliberately designing things so there is no \"best\" ship. So something like the Caterpillar for instance, if you're more into trying to board a bigger ship to take them over, a Caterpillar is definitely better for that than a Constellation. But also, all the different ships are going to have different pros and cons. So for instance, bigger ships are cool because you can have multiple people on them, you can have turrets, walk around, but bigger ships, just like in real life, won't be able to turn as fast or be as maneuverable as a smaller ships will be. There isn't really a best for anything. There may be a best for this particular role, but I think that's the beauty of Star Citizen. There are lots of different roles, lots of different things you can do. We're very focused on having different roles and functions for the ships, so there will be different kinds of play styles all based on what you want to do. So that's what I'm most looking forward to in the game: To have this whole variety of ships and somebody may just want to be flying single seater ships and focusing on dogfighting, people may want to be multiplayer, co-op, bigger ships doing exploration, or trading runs, or whatever.
