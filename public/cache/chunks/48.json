Born in 2742, he was the only son of Pax Harris and Ndilimeke Arnold, real estate moguls on Terra (Terra III). He graduated from the Astronautics Laboratory within the Martian Institute of Space Technology (MIST), where he was first exposed to the works of deceased spacecraft designer Leonard Casse, whose portfolio strongly influenced Arnold's future designs. In 2772, he founded Anvil Aerospace, which went on to become one of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) military's premier shipbuilders. Arnold insisted on personally approving every part of his vehicles' designs while he served as CEO. His policies of profit-sharing with his workers and fostering the talents of promising employees at Anvil led to the launch of many successful careers, and made him a popular figure in the often cutthroat spacecraft manufacturing industry. He died of old age in 2853. </p><br/><h1>CAREER</h1><br/><p>Arnold began his career as a junior designer at Aegis Dynamics in 2763, where he would eventually be assigned to assist on Project Monitor, developing the vehicle which would become the Hammerhead. A design of his was selected to be made into one of six prototypes, but it was not ultimately delivered to the UEE Navy (UEEN) after it failed early flight tests. Arnold became demoralized with his job after a lack of feedback from his supervisors, especially after repeated rejections of new designs following his failed prototype. In his spare time, he began to sketch ideas for ships based on the creations of his favorite designer, Leonard Casse. </p><br/><p>It became apparent to Arnold by 2770 that he had no path forward at Aegis. He decided to quit his position and accepted a seed loan from his parents to start his own ship manufacturing company, which he planned to operate based on the flat organization style that was used at Casse Aerospace. Under this style of management, everyone's opinions would be given equal weight no matter their status, with all final decisions left to Arnold. Although this would cause a long development process, Arnold felt that worker satisfaction would lead to a stronger final product.</p><br/><p>In 2772, construction on his new shipbuilding facility in Nova Kyiv, Terra was complete. Arnold named the new company Anvil Aerospace in reference to former MIST professor Robert Calvin's famous assertion from his book <em>Mechanisms of Empire</em> that military spending \"...fuels the furnaces of expansion and strikes the anvils of innovation.\" Within the first year, Arnold and his team had created a prototype fighter called the Osprey. As an homage to Casse, Arnold included signature elements from Casse's ships such as curved wings and the open circle signet in his own designs.</p><br/><p>Using connections he had made during his time at Aegis, Arnold showed the prototype to a small gathering of Navy officials. The ship proved to be a hit and the Navy placed Anvil's first ever order. As word spread of the new manufacturer's successful entry into the military market, it caught the eye of the holding firm that owned the rights to the Casse Aerospace portfolio, which sued Arnold for copyright infringement. Facing a potentially devastating lawsuit, Arnold chose to settle the case by purchasing all of Casse Aerospace's portfolio for an undisclosed sum. Arnold released a public statement that Anvil would continue to utilize Casse's signature elements in their ships as an ode to a talented designer who died far too young. </p><br/><p>After the events of the anti-Messer revolution in 2792, the UEE stripped Aegis Dynamics of most of its contracts due to its strong association with the Messer regime. As a part of the UEE Navy's defensive restructure focused on protecting and serving the civilian population, Anvil Aerospace was approached by Vice Admiral Galen Whishaw of the UEEN Research &amp; Development Division, who offered Anvil a direct contract to develop a brand new ship. The result was the U4A-3 Terrapin, a design that Arnold had been working on with lead engineer Allegra Wilsing. The successful deployment of that ship in 2796 helped to make Arnold and his company an indispensable part of the UEE's defense. Over the next few decades, Arnold personally supervised the development of all Anvil's military ships, most notably the F7A Hornet, which replaced the Aegis Avenger as the UEE's standard front-line fighter.</p><br/><h1>LATER LIFE</h1><br/><p>In semi-retirement by the early 2840s, Arnold nevertheless still required that all parts of a ship's development be approved by him. On a trip to MacArthur (Kilian V) in 2850, he is reported to have been evaluating changes made to Anvil's many projects on his mobiGlas in between meetings with UEEN leadership. He served as a guest lecturer at MIST in 2851 and was invited to return the following year, but he declined, citing a desire to return \"home\" to the Anvil offices in Nova Kyiv. He died at his desk in 2853.

She and Suen were exiled after a last attempt that destroyed one of Levski's ports and left three people gravely injured.

I don't know...FS: I think there will be... We've been working a lot on hair recently, that's been a big topic because no matter how great your head scans look, you still need hair.ST: And that's our biggest problem right? The current hair that we had worked on and even some of the tech we're fighting with a bit is that's what's bringing, not down, lowering the quality, bringing down the heads a little bit. You take a look at the head, you take a look at the face texture and we've got the crazy winkles, we've got pore mapping, we've got all this crazy stuff and then you've got a current gen looking hairFS: Hair which has some alpha test on it.ST: Exactly.FS: With maybe some directional mapset. There's a lot of elements still missing right? You can get that nice rim lighting.ST: Right, right.FS: I'm sure we've all seen the Paragon demo where they have all the hair strands and stuff.ST: Well they've got this awesome spine stuff which looks just amazing, I love the look of that and we're always checking that stuff out.FS: You always want all this tech, but you still have to commit to where you're at and work with the tools you have.ST: RightFS: To get it done and further down the roadmap you can always try to stay on top of what everybody else is doing and keep to the same technical standards that the rest of the games have.ST: Yeah, right, and same visual standards really right? I mean we've gotta be one of the best games out there and we don't want to give you any old technologies kind've the thing and we don't want to make the faces we spent so long on look worse.FS: Yeah.ST: So the actual question is: Are there gonna be barbershops? That's a design question, I have no idea about barbershops. What I do know is that you'll be modifying your face in a medical facility of some sort.FS: Yeah like reconstructive surgery.ST: So whether you're doing your hair at the same time, that's a great question, probably?FS: I would say so.ST: I would guess.FS: I would imagine anything that has to do with the head in general.ST: With your face so facial hair or whatever else so I guess you have to get plastic surgery to shave.FS: MaybeST: Fair enough. I mean yeah, we are in LAFS: We'll see what... [Laughs]ST: Pretty normal. There's a lot of problems to solve with the hair like Forrest was saying. Even down to just having different head sizes. I mean all the heads are a different size so how do you stop yourself from making every single haircut for every single head.FS: So if I have one haircut made for one head, but obviously when you're customizing your character you're gonna want to have access to all the different hairs.ST: Pull all the different hairs.FS: But what if you chose NPC shaped head 9 as opposed to NPC shape 55.ST: Exactly.FS: Or even if you controlled it through a modifier or something or blend shape whatever we're gonna end up doing. How do you make sure that the hair stays attached to the head when the head changes size?ST: That's the thing and those are problems that we're solving and they give you an idea of that particular one. How we want to do this is that we have an actual scalp map, we hold all the morph targets for every single head within the scalp map, or we keep offsets of every single joint that we need to offset when we're customizing the face so we only make one model that contains all the morph targets for every single head and then the hair cards on top of that, those are going to have to move around.FS: And we've kind've started to play around with it. We realized very early, eyelashes for example right?ST: Oh that's a good oneFS: You make eyelashes and then you're like \"Wait a minute, everyone has a slightly different size socket in the head\", so how do you make... You can't just make.. We have 120 different heads, you can just make one set of eyelashes to fit all the eye shapes right so all of a sudden you have to figure out, that's where our technical animators come in.ST: Yeah the technical art team, we've got a really awesome technical art team and one of the things that our team is the best at and I say this and I'm super proud of the guys for being able to always do this is these massive script updates that will affect all the assets together. So one of the hardest things about this game is the sheer scope of it right? Like \"How many heads we've got?\" \"We've got over 100 heads. \"How many character bodies do we got?\", we've got hundreds of these. You can't go in \"manually open up my tweak one, close it, save, manually open up my, close it, save\". It would take you all year, but we've got like Mark Mccall, John Rigs, Gauge, Matt Intrieri writing these scripts that are a batch process to it.So to give you an example, Mark Mccall made the eyelashes right? So one thing we don't get delivered eyelashes with the face is, it's a problem because they look pretty funny with eyelashes, especially females right? So what he's done is he actually has a script that builds the eyelash geometry. Not only does it build the eyelash geometry, but it checks the head that's it's working on, builds the geometry, skins it on, exports the process; puts it into a CDF and it's done.FS: Because that's how you manage it right because you want to have your artists spend your time on eyelashes because if you could have them spend time on one eyelash, they're gonna look really good. If they have to spend their time on 120 eyelashes, you're gonna have a very low quality set of eyelashes.ST: Right and you're gonna have an artist that wants to kill themselves by the end of it.FS: And we have this visual bar, yeah totally. So you want to have artists concentrate on single elements and then you have your technical artist populate those single elements in a very smart approach to save the labour time so we can concentrate on the visual fidelity and not the art labour.ST: The actual labour of it, Sure. This is where bugs come from. So to give you guys an idea, asset bugs, this is usually what happens. So you'll do a batch process like this, you have to spot check a whole bunch of them, maybe have QA check every single one of them, but you'll spot check a couple and then there'll be one that didn't one correctly or one that somebody's PC lagged out for a half a second or whatever, I mean this is where the asset bugs come from. It's not like somebody was sitting there, they looked at it, it's whatever the face is exploded and they're like \"Yeah that's good\" and they go an export it. It's usually something that somebody hasn't actually physically touched.FS: Yeah, yeah totally.ST: Cool.", "published_at": "2016-05-03", "title": "10 for the Developers: Episode 08", "source": "https://youtu.be/j02lrXo3fXA", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "BaconofWar", "published_at_timestamp": 1462234019}, {"objectID": "aac6bceadd55e_dashboard_generated_id", "answer": "The Prospector will be much better at pinpointing specific resources and extracting just that type of mineral, targeting pockets directly rather than multiple at once.", "published_at": "2016-04-27", "published_at_timestamp": 1461708000, "question": "Will the prospector be better at tracking/recovering smaller amounts of valuable and rare mineral deposits, compared to the Orion operating on mass scale collection?", "source": "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/15317-Q-A-MISC-Prospector-Part-I", "title": "Q&A: MISC Prospector - Part I", "type": "spectrum"}, {"objectID": "373679470", "question": "Will there be 2-step verification login and if so when will it be implemented?", "answer": "We are working on two step verification at the moment.

How do you decide what's okay to share and when?", "answer": "Eric Kieron Davis: That's a great question. Let's answer the first question how does this open level impact your jobs?Calix Reneau: Completely.EKD: Yeah?CR: Completely.EKD: Why?CR: Particularly the things I do very directly impact the final experience. The balance things like behaviours like if I make a change someone has noticed it. So being able to hear back from backers is exciting and terrifying and it's incredible I don't want to underplay that but there's also an element of I definitely the backers in mind I have all one million voices in my head when I make a change and I'm like [strokes beard] how's that going to play? Which is good. I definitely thinkEKD: I think to say that i'm not sure everybody knows but Calix implements a lot of the balance right? It's a company wide discussion everybody has their hands in it.Forrest Stephan: Having people in access so early it makes a huge impact.EKD/CR: Yeah.FS: For me I love the transparency because being able chat to the community in regards to the actual tech involved and kind sub them (?) our methods and the geeky side of the art is pretty fun like I very much grew up in mod communities where everyone shares information and I had a lot information shared to me which allowed me to do what I do and to be able to interact with modders on our forum and they ask questions on how some of the tech works then I can explain how we do things. I think it's kind of cool because it allows me to give back what was given to me and I know if I was younger I would have loved for a company that had this high end art to have access to one of the developers and ask them questions and to get answers would have been the coolest thing ever.CR: it's also kind of inspiring.FS: Yeah it's really pretty neat.EKD: To add into that you've been doing a lot of character work recently and Sean just voiced over that great video we saw at CitizenCon that was tech you guys had just shutdown or gotten to that point days before how does that feel to go I literally finished that and here we're showing everybody?FS: Yeah that was exciting cause definitely the Gary Oldman and then the characters in the Morrow tour were all using that new tech. From the heads to the bodies and there are lots of people involved to help make that happen and  is pretty remarkable tech and i'm looking forward to kind of sharing some of that tech with our fans as far as our approaches and how we do it and maybe we'll make some videos like a tutorial or some videos on how it works so we can give modders a head start.EKD: So from the writer's side...Adam Wieser: It looks great because it means more lore. Because it means that every week we've got something new to share with you at least and the jump points to and it helps us define the world in even greater detail than you normally would in a game at this point which is fantastic. We also have the messages  to be able to take people's responses on the message  boards and use them to kind of like, especially the role playing stuff that's being going out recently around the attack at Vega we've been able to use some of the great role playing down there by the fans and by everyone help us fill out certain aspects of that too. It's really great and every once in a while we'll do a lore builder segment where if we want to help build out the history behind Sataball or behind maybe how a certain parlour government is structured. It's great to get the input from the backers because there's a lot of people out there and there's only four of us we can only know so much. The community is so vast and has such a great experience and such a depth of knowledge it's great to be able to have there and dip into see what they're feeling and just tap into that knowledge and expertise. It's really niceEKD: I would say we buttoned up on the production side right? definitely where I came previously or where I've been previously it's very abnormal to share everything all the time. I think my first week at the company my second day on the job they're like hey that meeting you were just in? Now go on camera and tell everyone what you just talked about. It was a wild experience but kind of freeing also to know that i'm getting feedback and i'm working with them and i get to talk to you guys. It's a wild experience but I think the benefits are immense because we can afford these benefits here at this place there are fewer restrictions coming from the business side where you can't do certain things but I think it's great we can do that stuff.CR: We try to talk about anything that's in the game obviously anything that Chris has talked about is always safe. I tend to sort of gauge the sort of things I talk about either by the level of authority I personally have over it. Like if I have done this thing and I know everything about it then I feel a bit more comfortable talking about that. Cause the things we want to avoid we don't want to promise things or make it sound like we're doing things we're not. Miscommunication is probably the hardest thing about this. If you lead people to believe something whether you think it's true or you misspoke if that ever happens there's a lot to be held accountable for. So you try to be open and honest but you also tend to be very careful speaking speculatively. So like if something isn't a sure thing I try to, play with it ok we're open to these ideas because that much is true, we're trying to do these things but until it's in the game it's not real. So that's why I sort of leave it to you to tell me when things go out because until that happens...EKD: Yeah that's absolutely right and I think back to our original question. If you worked in the creative industry you know that we're coming up with crazy stuff in every meeting all the time. So if we were to say all that crap all the time out we would be all over the place. But obviously that's not the case that's just how we flesh out these creative ideas it's how we get to that final product.FS: It's brainstorming.EKD: Yeah exactly. When we go to that last part of the question i think that's the point. When do decide to share it? When we know like you said [nods to Calix] it's going to be there or right in there and we need your help cause we do want your feedback but at the same time we don't want to be like here's the craziest stuff we thought of today.FS: Sometimes we try these things and they don't work out.EKD: Exactly.FS: You got to take that idea and evolve it to see if it works.EKD: And that happens everywhere. Anywhere I've ever worked. On the writing side the first script you don't go that's it see you.AW: Yeah you don't walk away at that point.EKD: So if you shared that script wait why does that guy say that.

As long as there is an audience, as long as there are people playing it, we will be constantly be improving it, making it play better, making it look better, making it perform better.  I view Star Citizen as a living product, and we're just trying to get to the basic functionality that we can consider as V1.0, and then at that point hopefully people like it, and then we'll continue to add to it and improve it.

I feel this must be a moving target for QA in an unstable environment?", "answer": "Randy Vasquez: Yes.Vincent Sinatra: Yes.RV: Yes.RV: Yes. It is definitely an unstable environment. In fact more days than not it is quite unstable. There's going to be certain areas in the code you can't even look at. There's new iterations coming down. As far as causing havoc, well when you're out there in the PTU I think we want more controlled havoc...RV: Actually yeah. We would say controlled havoc or kind of like planned chaos.VS: Planned chaos.RV: That was the one we were kind of like..VS: Planned chaos that's what we want. Because doing strange and weird things is always great. Sometimes you find the best bugs by doing something that the average user would never even conceive of.Like what happens if I land this ship of this ship on top of another ship and you end up with some sort of shipception or something like that. Sometimes you can do that sort of wacky stuff and you could find some really good issues. But you don't want to do that to people who don't know what you're up to. Then it's just griefing.RV: Basically the point; don't be a griefer don't be dicks. Just be nice to people and if you want to test something crazy seriously just... We were talking about this, just be like...VS: Just ask people.RV: Be like \"Hey guys I want to do something crazy. Is anyone down for crazy?\".VS: Yeah!RV: Usually people will be like \"Oh crazy? We're in, we're doing this!\"VS: Yeah. We got a pretty good crazy base going on! People are just like to say \"Hey I want to try something wacky today does anybody else want to come here and help  me out with this?\" And usually we get one or two people to jump in. I know i've done it a live server a couple of times. So that's one of those things that you can do as far as havoc.As far as the PTU and how it helps us with the process. It really helps when it comes to performance, stability. We get those metrics from hundreds, thousands of users and obviously that's something we can't do internally because our Test Teams are only so big.RV: And also on that. People need to just log in and just be there. Cause even just logging in for a little bit here and there so that we can put the servers through their paces, the Engineers are getting really good information.The Designers are getting good information because the Designer can design something and then all of a sudden it works when you have one or two people there and you see this all the time probably. Five people there, but as soon as you hit the ninth or the tenth person everything just breaks down like crazy.VS: Whereever you can get those numbers it really helps. Because again the QA Teams are kept small and focused so we can you know 'laser fine accuracy' on what we need to be checking but you know...RV: SO point take away is: If you want to do some crazy stuff seriously just put it in chat and be like \"Hey you guys i'm trying this out does anyone want to join me?\"VS: Ask permission before you start using the Glaive to lift up other ships and stuff like that.RV: Just don't kill someone cause we've seen things on Youtube where people are just going crazy and just ramming another ship and the person's not even taken off. And i'm like \"Come on people. You know that's griefing\".VS: Because you don't know how long that person has to play. You may be in there for a four house session trying to hit up as much stuff as you possibly can. They're only there for fifteen minutes. They got kids, they've got to change diapers, they got to get the food ready, they got a bunch of other stuff.They just want to jump in and see what we have on the next PTU patch and they don't necessarily want to help you do crazy stuff. So just clear it ahead of time if you're going to involve other people in your wacky havoc causing tests.RV: The other thing is. We have such a strong community we don't need stuff like that it would just bring it down. Just help each other out.

We have the concept of there being two teams, the Marines and the Outlaws. They each have a selection of armor to choose from - light, medium, and heavy armor for each team which looks completely different and is themed with stats to their distinct behaviour. We also have a variety of weapons - submachine gun, assault rifle, laser assault rifle, electric shotgun, sniper rifle, frag grenade, EMP grenade, force propulsion grenade, area denial system, lots of things! I can't remember all of them. Oh! And the burst cannon which is my personal favourite... because I shot a QA guy in the face with that and when all of the little bursty parts exploded, he crashed - it was like the ultimate kill. So yes, there are a lot of different options and that's all just for the V0 release. The V0 release will include all of these different weapons and armor types.

Toilets and showers we've been talking about, but I think of it as a bit of a light-weight way to make these things all make sense, in terms of relevance, so you'll probably need to sleep eventually, after too long you might perform worse 'cause you're tired, or you need to eat occasionally, or if you don't shower for a while some NPCs won't want to talk to you 'cause you smell, etc etc. I'm not saying we go to the level of full-life simulation, but it'd be fun to have these things have a small effect on how you're perceived or how you exist in the universe. Our goal is to make SC as much as real universe as possible, a lot more than just about dog-fighting and cargo hauling, I want you to sight-see, fly around and see all the cool stuff there is in the universe, like maybe a restaurant on terra inside the big sky-sphere, like eating at the top of the empire state building, it might be a tough reservation to get, the food would be all a bit decorative, like drinking the drink from the flare cabinet. It might be a collection thing, like I might get a signed menu from the chef at that restaurant that I can put back in my hanger as a collectable/mementos. There's a level of stuff around the universe that I want to have that's more about fleshing out the universe, to give a sense of \"world\". So in answer to the question, I think those things would be a lightweight way to make the universe more real, so if you don't eat now and then you might get blurry vision or something, not sure we'll go that far, but we're trying to make these things have more meaning than just hte decorative.", "published_at": "2014-11-24", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 46 (2014.11.24)", "source": "https://youtu.be/FXnNwUmnl3o", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Vertisce", "published_at_timestamp": 1416870046}, {"objectID": "373678660", "question": "Are we able to rent our Spaceships to other players? If so, what happens if it gets destroyed while in their possession? Will the insurance still cover it even though I wasn't the pilot?", "answer": "You definitely will be able to lend or let other players fly your ship, and yes your insurance will cover your ship when someone else is flying it, though not the other bits (like upgrades, weapons etc). As to whether you can rent it, well seeing as you can hire other players or NPCs to fly your ships, and you can lend ships, our mechanics will allow you to kinda \"lend\" your ship to another player and get some payment from them in return, and yes your ship will be insured.", "published_at": "2014-09-29", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 39 (2014.09.29)", "source": "https://youtu.be/7mTLWkxEEeo", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Chairman Kaga", "published_at_timestamp": 1412028036}, {"objectID": "373679100", "question": "How widespread will corruption be in the SC universe (If it will even exist there). For example will there be police members that may take bribes, or Governors of backwater planets that may add extra taxes or place bounties on people they just \"don't like\"? How strong is the UEE?", "answer": "Well I don't know, I mean, I think we're trying to simulate a fairly realistic world, so that probably means there is a level of corruption in some places. We're certainly- ... we were thinking about some mechanics, you know, if you're a pirate and you get captured, and you get put into jail, basically the fiction for you going back out into the game versus literally being incarcerated and not being able to play the game - which wouldn't be that much fun - is that you essentially have to sort of bribe your way out of prison, or do something like that. So we're definitely gonna fictionally have some corruption that's happening, so I think that will just add an extra wrinkle. And I think there will be less of that the closer you are to the stronger, or the core UEE areas. So I guess I'm not sure whether it's going to be totally widespread, but there will definitely be a feature in some areas that there will be some level of corruption.", "published_at": "2014-08-25", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 35 (2014.08.25)", "source": "https://youtu.be/Uyur8rqbEHc", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Machinae", "published_at_timestamp": 1409004035}, {"objectID": "373685950", "question": "What kind of interactions can players have with non-hostile NPC ships? Can we request repair, refuel, and resupply assistance from a passing carrier, trade goods with merchant ships, things of that nature?", "answer": "So yes, the answer is absolutely yes. Those are all things that we want to do. As I said a little earlier in this section that one of my goals is to make the NPC behavior be pretty human like and they behave and do the same jobs and same actions as players will do and also obscure the fact that it is an NPC from a real player, at least at a distance from people so it just feels like it's a living breathing world that's populated and you'll run into people and hey some may be AI controlled and some may be player controlled. If we do our job right, maybe you won't even realize that a player is playing his ship, you think it's an AI and vice versa, so they'll definitely be able to help you out, they'll refuel you, they'll do all those kind of things they're all sorts of things that we're planning for.", "published_at": "2014-01-17", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 05 (2014.01.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/RtyZzO5OrE0", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "ArbitrarySketch", "published_at_timestamp": 1389982600}, {"objectID": "19ddca1aaf5050_dashboard_generated_id", "question": "Will there be more than one faction/Corporation/government to which you can earn citizenship to or will there only be the one faction?", "answer": "Citizenship is earned in the UEE - so its not tied to a faction or corp.", "user": "bignick277", "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12grru/i_am_chris_roberts_creator_of_wing_commander/c6uz77i/", "published_at_timestamp": 1351771200, "title": "r/IAmA: Chris Roberts", "type": "reddit"}]
