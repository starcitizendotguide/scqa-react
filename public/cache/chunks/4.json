But you can only do it so many times, so after a certain point your body is just going to give out. So you can almost think of it as an old school sort of game life or something and after you know whatever it will be, Three of them two of them four of them eight of them or whatever. There's only so many bionic arm replacements so many times they can heal you up, you know luke skywalker, empire strikes back, and in that particular case then yes you'll go on to pass it down to your heir but that wont necessary be happening all the time, second of all, a bounty will die with the person that dies so whoever killed that person and they had a bounty on their head. you collect the bounty. So it doesn't pass down to heirs basically if I have a bounty on a character, it's for that character. so if you capture them, kill them then you'd get the bounty and in some ways you start fresh as an heir and maybe  there's a small amount of reputation that carries over so you know you're the son of the notorious crime boss of something then you know perhaps people look on you as slightly different as he would. but mostly the sins of the heir stay with the parents. For those of you who are worried if someone will kill themselves to avoid the bounty being claimed on them, I will say that since we only have a limited amount of lives and dying is kind of a pain. It would be a pretty extraordinary step to basically kill yourself rather than have a bounty claimed on you. Mainly because like I said you only have a few number of lives you'll die, pass on, you'll lose like whatever ship you were in at the point and the point with the equipment on it maybe you wont lose the hull that'll pass onto your inheritance and you never know if there's death taxes in certain areas of the universe. and all those kind of things, so we'll definitely make it in a way that people can't game the system, well I have a bounty on me so I'll kill myself so my next of kin will take over.

It'll depend on what encounter scenarios we set up for them and where you find them at any time. To be clear with everyone, we're looking at setting up the universe with about 90% AI and 10% players, which we think will allow players to have an impact in areas, but not to completely destabilise it. So you'll mostly see/encounter NPCs. There will be certain areas that'll attract more players and PvP etc, but as you're flying around you'll see cargo traders, cruise liners, pirate etc as NPCs. We're trying to make it so that it's not just about space, it's also the results of these people going about their daily lives, or missions or trading etc. In the event of going after a big bounty NPC for example, there may be a case where you go after him in space, then he goes down to a planet where you have to land and chase him on foot, down to a certain area and maybe have a gunfight down a shady alley. All of these things will be part of the mission system we're building, where different encounter scenarios can be strung together depending on the outcome of the previous one. It'll allow for a very dynamic experience, it won't feel like it's been scripted, as each one of these mission modules are fairly basic, but these mount onto one another and so feel very different once all built.

Right now we're plenty limited because getting more than eight or ten kilometers away from the origin starts to give floating point errors in the world and rendering. Once the Large World is in, which is the 64-bit stuff, some of the bigger ships, the multi-crew ships, that's kind of one of the things we're waiting on to get the multi-crew ships going. There's a whole range of long-range scanners and all that kind of stuff that comes into play, so there probably will be some long range smart weapons. I am not sure there will be vast amounts of that, since it's not very fun to have all combat at beyond visual range but there definitely will be some cases of some stuff that will allow you to at least engage in a longer range than you do in Arena Commander.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 49 (2014.12.22)", "source": "https://youtu.be/rFfzlZ4bL8I", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "ERK", "published_at_timestamp": 1419289210}, {"objectID": "373678260", "question": "With the reveal of the new Aegis Reclaimer I was wondering if its salvage arm could have other uses such as latching onto another large ship like the Constellation and hold it in place while another ship boards and takes over the ship with minimal damage?", "answer": "Well, that's a cool idea, I don't know if the salvage arm is going to be quick enough to grab another ship if it's flying around, but definitely if the constellation isn't moving it should just be a physics simulation where the arm holds the constellation as still as possible, but it'd be pretty hard to catch I'd imagine, if it didn't want to be caught.

We're going to be moving to a new sound system as well, in the engine - Wwise from FMOD. So that's kind of the goal - it's not working right now, but we kinda want to filter and process, like if I'm chatting to my friend and we're playing together, my voice is sort of filtered by my situation - I've got a helmet on, or I don't have a helmet on, whether I'm in an area that's echoey or not, or whether I'm behind them, or at the front or the side.

But it's not that your friends also are hanging out on the ship involved in the story as you're going along, 'cause that's really hard to do.You can't tell 4-5 narrative stories all at the same time, 'cause it's usually always focused around the protagonist, which is you the player.

In all our spaceships you will always be under the control of the Intelligent Flight Control System, which is basically our fly-by-wire, and I actually would challenge anyone to be able to fly these ships without having some computer assistance, because they've got multiple thrusters and there's a lot of... The simulation right now is actually incredibly accurate and is very dependent on the center of mass, and everything else. So there's a lot of thrusters firing.If you don't have an optimal center of mass, some thrusters will be firing to compensate for lateral or angular movement that you don't want to achieve in the movement that you're going for. What we have, we actually demoed it at the PAX East event that we just did, and it is gonna be part of the Dogfighting Module, so everyone will get to play it.The short answer to this question is actually yes, all these things will be there, although IFCS is what delivers it for you, is that you will be able to fly normally, which is the Wing Commander style where the computer tries to align your velocity with wherever you're pointing your nose, and it will do it as quickly as the thrusters will allow it to do, within the limits of the amount of g's you can pull.But, you can enter decoupled mode, when you're flying around, and in decoupled mode you have two things you can do.You can just change your orientation. That means in decoupled mode, whatever velocity you had when you entered it maintains and you keep moving in that way, and when you start to change your pitch, or roll, or yaw, it's just changing the orientation of your ship, it's not changing your linear velocity vector.And then we have the strafe mode of decoupled mode, and that is allowing you to go left, go right, go up, go down, go forward, go back.As we demoed, and I think by the time you've seen this, there will have been a demo that we will have shown already that shows all those different aspects. A bit more in depth demo of all the features that will be in the dogfighting, and some of the stuff we didn't get to show at the PAX East event, because we had a few technical glitches. Mainly because we're showing stuff way, way earlier than we would normally, therefore you're a little at the mercy of the gremlins.There you go, yes, 6 degrees of freedom, and you can change your orientation, you can strafe, all the rest of the stuff.I think it's gonna add a lot to the combat, and I'm really curious to see, once we start doing it, as people develop their fight styles, what works, what doesn't work, what do people prefer, it will be very cool.", "title": "10 for the Chairman Episode 17 .

I thought it would be really cool that you could be playing this game and making some real world money from toiling away virtually.But right now we don't have any plans for that. There are some legal issues to be dealt with. Then also I had some concerns about whether that would potentially bring something to the game that may make it less fun and be problematic.So right now we don't have any plans, we may assess it in the future, but I would really like to see how the Persistent Universe plays, how everything works, how people interact with each other, before making the decision about that because I think that potentially could be fairly unbalancing. I know that there were issues on Diablo with the real money auction house.So, interested intellectually, but not necessarily convinced I want to put it in the game just yet.So that will be a \"put a pin in it\" one.", "title": "10 for the Chairman: Episode 08 (2014.02.17)", "source": "https://youtu.be/wE_xZdeakEw", "transcript": "https://relay.sc", "type": "youtube", "user": "Me", "published_at_timestamp": 1392677901}]
